  "content": "**CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!**\n\nThe furnace roared. Metal screamed under the hammer's kiss.\n\nFor a full day, Grid repeated the sacred rhythm of his craft—heating, hammering, quenching. Yet the two White Tiger's Breaths refused to yield. With each strike, they grew more ferocious rather than more compliant, their thorns erupting like the hackles of a cornered beast.\n\n**CLANG!**\n\n[You have wounded the pride of the noble White Tiger!]\n\n[The White Tiger is angry!]\n\n[You have suffered 890 damage.]\n\n[You have suffered 844 damage...]\n\nGrid's face became a map of bleeding scratches. 'Compared to the Red Phoenix, this thing's as arrogant as a yangban.'\n\nThe materials defended themselves like a hedgehog under threat. Every impact sent dozens of thorns exploding outward, each one eager to taste his blood. That phrase—*the pride of the noble White Tiger*—grated on him. The damn thing attacked whenever its dignity was challenged, revealing exactly how insufferably proud its source deity must be.\n\n*One day, when I visit the East Continent...*\n\n**CLANG!** The hammer fell.\n\n*If I ever encounter the sacred creatures...*\n\n**CRACK!** Metal shrieked.\n\n*I'll avoid the White Tiger entirely. Better yet—I won't meet it at all.*\n\nYet even as these thoughts flickered through his mind, Grid's body moved with mechanical precision, weaving between the thorn barrages. He didn't notice how Kraugel's potion assistance had gradually diminished.\n\nKraugel's eyes gleamed with understanding. Grid could have simply used the God Hands to shield himself. Instead, he faced the assault head-on, reading the patterns, analyzing the timing. 'He's training while he works. Building his evasion, sharpening his instincts.'\n\nKraugel had assumed Grid was too lost in crafting to think tactically. But this was calculated—Grid transformed every obstacle into opportunity. 'This is why he stands where he does.'\n\nWarmth touched Kraugel's gaze as he watched his rival dance between thorns and flame.\n\nBut even Kraugel's perceptive eye missed something.\n\n[The experience of Tiramet's Belt (Unique) has increased by 0.01%!]\n\nThe White Tiger's Breaths were high-quality but relatively low-damage, making them perfect for grinding item experience. True, 0.01% per thousand strikes was glacial progress. Still, it was progress.\n\n*Shame these don't count as proper attacks,* Grid mused. *Elfin Stone's Ring would benefit too.*\n\nThree birds with one stone: honing his evasion, raising item experience, and expanding his tactical thinking—all while working toward his primary goal. Grid had learned his lesson. He would never waste materials like the White Tiger's Breaths on sloppy craftsmanship.\n\n**CLANG! CLANG!**\n\nHis concentration ran so deep he could count individual sparks flying from each hammer blow.\n\nBut the result wasn't cooperating.\n\n**CRACK.**\n\n\"Damn it...\"\n\nBy the third day, exhaustion crept through Grid's bones. The White Tiger's Breaths remained as defiant as hour one.\n\n*How stubborn can this thing be?*\n\nThese materials far exceeded the resistance of other myth-rated components. Despite endless cycles of heating and hammering, they maintained their original shape with spiteful determination. That phrase echoed again—*the pride of the noble White Tiger*—and Grid began to suspect the personality of the beast itself was somehow encoded in the material.\n\n*Wait...*\n\nRealization struck like lightning on the third night.\n\n*This isn't about personality. It's elemental.*\n\nWhite Tiger. Earth attribute. Earth beats fire in the natural order. The basics he'd overlooked in his eagerness. This entire approach had been doomed from the start.\n\n*The White Tiger's Breath is earth energy incarnate. Conventional smelting can't touch it.*\n\nFrustration bloomed into a headache. Kraugel, who'd maintained vigil for three straight days, noticed immediately when the hammering ceased.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"It won't smelt.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nPanmir jerked awake from his mat in the corner, where he'd been stealing moments of rest between observations. \"What do you mean it won't smelt?\"\n\nFor three days, Panmir had absorbed every motion of the legendary blacksmith's technique. Grid's craftsmanship had been flawless. Yet the White Tiger's Breaths remained pristine. If they couldn't be smelted...\n\n\"Then the item is impossible?\"\n\nPanmir had never handled myth-rated materials. His confusion was understandable. Kraugel maintained his silence—this wasn't his expertise—but Panmir pressed forward with questions.\n\n\"Is the temperature insufficient? High melting point due to the earth attribute?\"\n\n\"No. I've reached the melting point.\"\n\nGrid launched into an explanation. Minerals came in two categories: pure substances and mixtures. Iron was pure; once heated to 1,530 degrees, the temperature plateaued until complete melting. Steel, however, was a mixture—its temperature continued climbing a hundred degrees past the melting point.\n\nThe temperature behavior revealed the material's nature.\n\n\"The White Tiger's Breath is pure. No foreign materials. The evidence? Temperature stopped rising at 7,230 degrees.\"\n\nThe system confirmed it. The melting point had been achieved. When removed from the furnace, the beads did soften to a clay-like consistency.\n\n\"But even in that state, quenching and hammering won't change its shape?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Took me too long to realize. I thought the material was simply tough—that gradual progress through repetition would reshape it eventually.\" Grid shook his head. \"I was wrong from the beginning. To strengthen these, I need to dissolve them completely.\"\n\nThe temperature was adequate. The method was flawed. Grid considered the problem, then asked both observers, \"What counters the earth attribute?\"\n\n\"Water and ice, naturally.\"\n\n\"Plant-based techniques work too, in specialized applications.\"\n\n\"Saturation, transformation, freezing, internal fracturing...\" Grid nodded slowly. \"To strengthen them, I must first weaken them.\"\n\nBut blacksmiths worked with fire. Water, ice, and plants fell outside his domain.\n\n*Can a blacksmith even strengthen this alone?*\n\nStrictly speaking—no. Cooperation was essential. Grid found himself missing Braham acutely.\n\n*If Braham were here...*\n\n\"Bah! Child's play. I'll drown that bead like a rat in a barrel. Or freeze it solid and shatter it to fragments.\"\n\nThe imagined arrogance was so vivid, Grid almost heard the vampire's voice.\n\n\"...Ah.\"\n\nA bitter smile touched his lips. His greatest strength had always been other people. He opened a whisper to Lauel immediately.\n\n—Is there a magician in our guild who specializes in water magic?\n\n—Not sure why you're asking, but yes. One person with powerful water attribute magic.\n\nLauel's standards were exacting. He constantly scouted talent, yet always positioned Grid at the center. For him to use the word 'powerful' meant something.\n\n—Who?\n\n—Euphemina.\n\n—Ah!\n\nOf course—the Duplicator. She could replicate the finest water magic. Hope flared, then guttered.\n\n*But how easily can she duplicate high-level spells?*\n\nShe'd need to find the caster, observe the casting in real-time. Who knew how many days that would take? Grid needed results now.\n\nAnother whisper arrived.\n\n—Hasn't Euphemina learned Mumud's magic? I heard she acquired his water spells.\n\n—That's right! Of course!\n\nJoy transformed Grid's expression. Braham, legendary among legends. Mumud, the prodigy who survived solo combat with Fire Dragon Trauka. Mumud's magic would rival Braham's power.\n\nGrid whispered Euphemina immediately.\n\n—Euphemina! Can you come to the smithy right now?\n\n—Of course. You're calling.\n\nNo questions asked. Euphemina led the Grid loyalist faction. Thanks to Mumud's magic, she'd transcended the limitations of her Duplicator class, hunting without restriction. She returned to Reinhardt at once.\n\n***\n\n\"These?\"\n\nTwo white beads. Not pearl-lustrous but deep white, pure and profound. Yet their surfaces gleamed with otherworldly spiritual energy.\n\n\"Hit them with water magic. Push them to the breaking point without shattering them.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nEuphemina pressed her palms together. It took only a heartbeat.\n\n*What—?*\n\nGrid and Kraugel's eyes widened simultaneously. Blue intangible mana gathered at Euphemina's fingertips—but the behavior was wrong. Most magicians *emitted* their own mana. Euphemina *absorbed* the ambient energy around her, drawing the smithy's latent power into herself.\n\n**FWOOOM!**\n\nShe released the accumulated force. Water erupted in a pressurized stream that hammered into the White Tiger's Breaths. Then—\n\n\"Impossible—\"\n\n\"That much power—\"\n\nBoth men paled. The White Tiger's Breaths, which had withstood three days of Grid's hammering without yielding a millimeter, *dented* from a single spell.\n\n**CRACK! CRACK! CRACK-CRACK-CRACK!**\n\nEuphemina maintained her assault, each surge of water battering the beads like ocean waves against stone. Grid watched the magic manifest with the ferocity of a rabid beast.\n\n*The spell mirrors its master...*\n\nHe'd feared Euphemina once, and that old wariness stirred at the display of raw magical violence.\n\n\"Stop! That's enough!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe moment Euphemina released her magic, Grid seized the White Tiger's Breaths. They'd transformed—surfaces covered in spiderwebs of cracks, like glass beads on the verge of shattering.\n\n*Perfect!*\n\nGrid moved without hesitation. White phosphorus wood fed the flames. The cracked beads entered the furnace, already heated to 7,230 degrees. Then—\n\n**CRACK. CRACK-CRACK.**\n\nWithin the inferno, the fractures spread like lightning through ice. The smelting had finally begun. Knowledge met skill. Experience met magic. Grid, Kraugel, and Euphemina had forged a solution together.\n\nAs Grid watched the White Tiger's Breaths begin to dissolve at last, certainty crystallized in his chest.\n\nThe strongest sword would be born."
