  "content": "**Chapter: Eyes of Creation**\n\nAmong the general playerbase, Pagma's Descendant held legendary status—quite literally. As the first legendary class to come to public attention, it had sparked endless debate and more than a little jealousy. The consensus? An overpowered cheat class. Combat prowess rivaling a Sword Saint, combined with the ability to randomly forge legendary items? Absolutely broken.\n\nOf course, the truth was more nuanced.\n\nLike every class in Satisfy, Pagma's Descendant had its disadvantages. The glaring penalty: no automated production. Every single item had to be crafted manually, hammer strike by painstaking hammer strike. And while the production abilities were exceptional, the combat skills couldn't match dedicated fighter classes.\n\nIn other words, Pagma's Descendant's reputation as \"strongest class\" existed for one reason only: Grid himself. His sheer, bloody-minded tenacity. Thousands upon thousands of hours spent at the forge, manually crafting items one at a time. Over a thousand legendary pieces, each representing countless failures and refinements.\n\nThe S.A. Group understood this better than anyone. Their internal assessments were unanimous—if an ordinary player had acquired Pagma's Descendant, the class would never have achieved its mythical reputation. Few people possessed the psychological fortitude to repeat the same grueling work for hours, days, years. To do it hundreds or thousands of times without breaking.\n\n\"I certainly couldn't,\" Panmir admitted to the crowd assembled in Reinhardt's central plaza. Thousands of blacksmiths had gathered to hear the continent's top craftsman speak—a number that would have been unthinkable just months ago.\n\nPanmir's expression was wry. \"The mental strain would crush me. Sure, I could focus when crafting my own equipment or a commissioned piece for profit. But that intensity? Occasionally at best.\"\n\nHe swept his gaze across the sea of faces. \"Grid is worthy of respect.\"\n\nMurmurs rippled through the crowd.\n\n\"Now that you mention it...\"\n\n\"I never thought about what that actually means.\"\n\n\"Wait, so production classes have the auto-crafting system, but the *legendary blacksmith* doesn't?\"\n\n\"Panmir wouldn't lie about this. Grid crushed his business—why would he defend him?\"\n\n\"True. And you saw the National Competition. Those techniques don't come from pushing buttons.\"\n\nEvery person present shared one thing: they were blacksmiths. The very people who, in recent weeks, had flooded into the Overgeared Kingdom after Grid received Hexetia's blessing. A mass migration that had reshaped the continent's economic landscape.\n\nPanmir's voice cut through the chatter. \"Some of you still doubt. That's fine. Watch from the sidelines. Learn. You'll understand soon enough.\" His tone sharpened, taking on an edge of challenge. \"But learning isn't enough. You need to give back.\"\n\nHe let that sink in before continuing. \"Work hard. Push your limits. Grow. Do that, and rewards will follow.\" A slight smile touched his lips. \"Under Grid's guidance, you can become craftsmen. True craftsmen.\"\n\n\"Yeah!\"\n\nThe roar of enthusiasm was immediate. Faith—Panmir had planted seeds of faith, and they took root in fertile ground. The blacksmiths' motivation soared.\n\nWhich was exactly when Lauel struck.\n\n\"Attention, craftsmen!\" The strategist's voice carried easily across the plaza, smooth as silk. \"A reminder: please sell your work to the kingdom directly rather than the open exchange. We'll beat any market price.\" His smile widened. \"Plus, you'll earn contribution points. Consider it an investment in your future.\"\n\nHe stepped back, watching the eager nods with satisfaction. The pieces were falling into place beautifully.\n\nLauel had noticed something crucial: blacksmiths had abandoned nearly every other kingdom to flock here. The implications were staggering.\n\n*A blacksmith famine everywhere except the Overgeared Kingdom. If we control the bulk of item production...*\n\nMarket domination. The foundation for truly excessive profits.\n\nHis fingers drummed against his side, a rare external tell of his excitement. *Soon. Very soon, players across the continent will be wearing our products. Our equipment. Our brands.*\n\nThe future gleamed before him—wealth accumulation that would dwarf other powers completely.\n\nOnly one thing soured his triumph.\n\n\"...I don't have special eyes.\"\n\nEven as his brilliant mind orchestrated this economic stranglehold, even as he squeezed advantage from every angle... his eyes remained ordinary. Brown. Human. Nothing like the luminous blue Grid had acquired mere hours ago.\n\nLauel's jaw tightened. *So jealous I could scream.*\n\n***\n\nGrid studied his reflection, turning his head slightly to catch different angles.\n\nHis eyes looked... mostly normal. Dark irises ringed by pale blue, like someone wearing subtle colored contacts. Nothing dramatic.\n\n\"Pagma's Eyes.\"\n\nThe moment he activated the skill, everything changed. The blue ring intensified, thickening into a corona of ethereal light. Combined with the silver crown resting on his black hair, the effect was striking—an otherworldly charisma that transcended gender appeal.\n\nGrid barely noticed.\n\nHe'd never been one to admire his own appearance, and vanity wouldn't start now. What mattered was function, not aesthetics.\n\n*The real question: can I still use the Slaughterer's Eye Patch effect?*\n\n[The Slaughterer's Eye Patch is equipped.]\n\n*Good. No conflicts.*\n\nHe deactivated the eyes, mind already racing ahead. The goddess's blessing had fundamentally altered his capabilities. According to the skill description, automatic production—the \"production button\"—would now be available to him. The speed increase alone was revolutionary. What had been a cottage industry could scale into a true factory.\n\nBut there was a catch.\n\n*Auto-production reduces the chance of high-tier results. I'd be trading quality for quantity.*\n\nExcept... he didn't have to make that trade. Not anymore.\n\n*The Blacksmith Hammer to Go Against the Gods ensures minimum epic-grade output. And with Pagma's Eyes, I can push even auto-crafted items toward legendary status.*\n\nThe implications crystallized. He could outfit an elite strike force with legendary equipment. A small, devastating unit capable of—\n\n*Raiding a great demon.*\n\nHis heart hammered against his ribs. The confluence of the goddess's blessing, Pagma's Eyes, and the divine hammer... it was like magic. Real magic, the kind that changed everything.\n\nThe legendary great magician Braham. The Undefeated King Madra. Giants of power who had shaped history itself.\n\n*I'm not there yet. But I'm building the foundation. A different path, but the same destination.*\n\nExcitement and terror warred in his chest. After years of grinding, sacrificing, clawing for every advantage... success felt almost too large to grasp.\n\n*I couldn't have done this alone.*\n\nThe realization sobered him. Yura had given him emotional stability, a place to belong beyond the game. Jishuka had offered trust when the Overgeared Guild was just a fever dream. Lauel's strategic genius had multiplied his effectiveness tenfold. Even Huroi had taught him something—watching that vulgar mouth work had shown him the importance of measured speech.\n\nAnd dozens of others. Colleagues who had believed when belief was a gamble.\n\n*I owe them everything.*\n\nGrid's expression softened. Most people would call that sentiment absurd—he'd given far more than he'd received. But status didn't change debt. In his heart, he was still the nobody who'd lucked into Pagma's class. Still the failure who would be rotting in some beginner village if not for—\n\n[Daily access time exceeded.]\n\n[Excessive gaming may adversely affect your health. You will be automatically logged out.]\n\nThe notifications pulled him back to reality. Not Grid's reality—Shin Youngwoo's reality.\n\n\"Right. Shower first.\"\n\nHe emerged from the capsule into his penthouse apartment. Exercise had transformed his once-scrawny frame. Adversity had tempered his spirit. Success had bought him this palace of glass and steel.\n\nAnd waiting for him, like always, was family.\n\n\"Long day?\" Sehee asked, already pressing the sanitization button on his diamond-class capsule. She had towels ready, fresh clothes folded nearby. Knew his schedule by heart.\n\n\"Thanks.\" Youngwoo accepted the clothes, then froze.\n\nHis sister's eyes were blazing.\n\n\"Uh. What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Do you really not know?\" Sehee's voice could have flash-frozen water. \"Or are you just that oblivious?\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\n\"I watched the broadcast! When that demon attacked and *all ten* of your top people had to fight together!\" She jabbed a finger at his chest. \"Why. Didn't. You. Call. Me?\"\n\nYoungwoo blinked. \"Ruby\" was Sehee's in-game identity—she played a Saintess, a growth-type hidden class with support abilities that dwarfed ordinary priests. But even so...\n\n\"Because it was too dangerous? Your level—\"\n\n\"I'm level two hundred and seventy!\"\n\n\"—is too low, yeah.\"\n\n\"I can clear vampire cities! Me and Yerim did one together!\"\n\nYoungwoo's face spasmed. Then he burst out laughing. \"Ahaha! Yeah, okay. Sure you did.\"\n\n\"It's true!\" Sehee's face flushed. \"I mean, not one with true bloods still active. One you'd already cleared, but—\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. Right.\" He was still chuckling as he turned toward the bathroom. \"I'm hitting the shower.\"\n\nThe idea was absurd. Two players below level three hundred clearing a vampire city? Even with the true bloods removed, those places were brutal. Most of his ten retainers needed full parties for vampire city raids. Chris and Yura were exceptions, not the rule.\n\n*And a Saintess runs out of resources. Even with Yerim tanking and dealing damage, the numbers don't work.*\n\n\"I'm telling the truth, you jerk!\"\n\n\"Whatever you say~\" He stuck his tongue out—a gesture he'd never have dared a few years ago—and closed the bathroom door on her indignant spluttering.\n\n*Ding.*\n\nFrom the living room, the wall-mounted TV chimed with a notification. New email.\n\nSender: S.A. Group\nSubject: Demon King Project\n\n\"That insufferable—huh?\" Sehee's anger evaporated. She moved closer to the screen.\n\nYoungwoo had linked his email to the TV's system out of necessity. The sheer volume of broadcast requests, sponsorship offers, and interview demands was overwhelming. Sehee handled the filtering, which meant she had full access.\n\nShe didn't hesitate to open this one.\n\nHer eyes widened as she read.\n\n\"Playing a demon king... in secret? And the rewards...\" She scrolled further. \"Piaro, Asmophel, Mercedes, and Noll as the four heavenly kings? This is incredible.\"\n\nThe concept was ambitious: Grid as a hidden boss, supported by four of his strongest NPCs, facing off against hundreds of players in a special event. The compensation for participating was substantial. Very substantial.\n\nShe checked the timeline. \"Three months? The Fourth National Competition is coming up fast.\"\n\nIn the bathroom, water hissed against tile. Steam billowed from under the door.\n\nYoungwoo stood beneath the rainfall shower head, phone in hand, protected by a waterproof case. He'd pulled up the same email on the bathroom TV—a habit from his days of obsessive information consumption.\n\nHis reflection in the fogged mirror showed an expression that didn't quite match his usual demeanor. Something darker. Hungrier.\n\n\"I'll accept,\" he murmured. \"On one condition.\"\n\nThe National Competition used separate servers now, isolated from the main game. Which meant the \"creation\" skill would be available without restrictions or consequences. And facing hundreds of players alone—even with four powerful NPCs as support—was a monumental challenge.\n\nOne that deserved monumental compensation.\n\n*Pavranium. Divine stone. The rarest minerals available.*\n\nHis smile widened beneath the cascading water.\n\n*The four heavenly kings will need proper equipment, after all. Can't have them fighting at anything less than full power.*\n\nIt was a golden opportunity. One he had absolutely no intention of wasting."
