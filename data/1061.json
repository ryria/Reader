  "content": "# Chapter Rewrite\n\nAt level 363, Resh ranked among Satisfy's elite. For someone who'd devoured fantasy novels and films since childhood, the game's release had been nothing short of a miracle—a chance to live the dream he'd chased through countless pages and screens.\n\n*A knight.* The word alone sent a thrill through him.\n\nAfter months of meticulous planning, Resh had built his character with a single goal in mind. Now he served as Prince Dulandal's sworn blade, personal knight to the Saharan Empire's second prince. Sure, his level paled compared to the NPCs around him, but dedication and a senior knight's mentorship had earned him the coveted daily quest: four hours guarding the prince's side each day.\n\nEvery morning felt like stepping into the storybooks of his youth. He embodied everything he'd admired in those fictional heroes—unwavering loyalty, selfless devotion, quiet pride in service.\n\n\"Where the hell do you get off talking to me like some drinking buddy? In front of my *men*, no less!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nPrince Dulandal stormed through the palace halls, his mood foul. Resh had heard the prince visited his younger brother—the fourth prince—that morning. Whatever happened there had clearly gone poorly. A senior knight bowed low as Dulandal swept past, then released a weary sigh as the bedroom door slammed shut.\n\n\"Smells like blood on him,\" the knight muttered.\n\n\"Blood?\" Resh's brow furrowed.\n\nThe Saharan Empire existed in perpetual conflict, crushing rebellions and minority uprisings across its vast territory. But those battles rarely touched the capital, and imperial princes almost never set foot on actual battlefields. Blood had no place on Dulandal's fine clothes.\n\nThe senior knight's voice dropped to a whisper. \"Strange happenings across the capital. Three of the seven dukes have vanished.\"\n\n\"The dukes? You mean Grenhal, Morse, and Basara?\" Resh's confusion deepened. \"Didn't they arrive last week for an audience with His Majesty? I heard they're staying at their estates while they wait.\"\n\n\"*Were* staying.\" The knight's expression remained grim. \"Now they're gone.\"\n\n\"They probably went hunting or something.\" Resh forced a laugh that rang hollow even to his own ears. The seven dukes commanded more military might than some kingdoms. Who could possibly harm them? The very suggestion seemed absurd.\n\nBut the senior knight wasn't laughing. \"I've been hearing troubling reports about the fourth prince. Word is, he ordered the Abyss reopened.\"\n\nIce water flooded Resh's veins. \"The Abyss?\"\n\nEvery citizen of the empire knew that name, whispered in taverns and servant quarters. The Abyss served as the ultimate punishment—worse than execution—reserved for marquises and dukes who committed high treason. Political prisoners disappeared into its depths and never returned whole. Rumor claimed something down there shattered men's minds like glass.\n\n\"No one's opened those doors in decades,\" the knight continued. \"Then three dukes disappear, and suddenly the fourth prince has the Abyss unsealed? Draw your own conclusions.\"\n\n*Oh no.* Resh's instincts—honed through hundreds of quests and dungeon delves—screamed a warning. He knew what was coming before the notification appeared.\n\n[Hidden Quest ★ **Abyss Exploration** ★ has occurred!]\n\n\"Only the emperor can access the prisoner registry,\" Bell explained. \"But any marquis or higher can throw someone in there. Prince Dulandal believes his brother has imprisoned the dukes. If that's true, they're suffering unimaginable torment while His Majesty is away. We need to know who's down there before the fourth prince can use them as leverage.\"\n\n\"Hold on.\" Resh's mind reeled. \"This is way above my pay grade. I don't even fully understand what's happening. How does the fourth prince have the authority to arrest *dukes*?\"\n\n\"He doesn't have the authority. He has the *power*.\" Bell's weathered face remained impassive. \"Those 'magic machines' everyone pretends don't exist? They're a private army. And the fourth prince inherited red energy rivaling even the first prince's strength. Even the dukes couldn't stand against him alone.\"\n\n\"But Duke Basara is his *cousin*! He imprisoned his own blood?\"\n\n\"Dulandal and the fourth prince share a father, yet they've been at each other's throats for years. Family means nothing when the throne is at stake.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Reality crashed down on Resh's romantic notions. Medieval politics. Court factions. Imperial power struggles. The shining world of chivalry he'd idealized looked uglier by the moment.\n\nBell gripped his shoulder. \"The emperor's return has been delayed four days. That gives us six days total to get answers. Infiltrate the Abyss, secure the prisoner list. I'll handle what comes after.\"\n\n\"By myself?\" Resh's voice cracked. \"How am I supposed to—\"\n\n\"Who said anything about going alone?\"\n\nThe quest details materialized before Resh's eyes:\n\n---\n\n**[Abyss Exploration]**\n\n**★ Hidden Quest ★**\n\n*Senior Knight Bell recognizes your connections as a wandering knight. Use those contacts to explore the Abyss and secure the prisoner registry.*\n\n***Two players may join you! All party members receive equal rewards!***\n\n**Success Conditions:**\n1. Map at least 15% of the Abyss Dungeon\n2. Obtain the prisoner list\n\n**Rewards:** +3 Levels | Unlock Affinity with Dulandal | Unique Skill Book | Title: <span class=\"title\">Peering into the Depths</span>\n\n**Failure Penalty:** -5 Levels\n\n---\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe rewards were staggering. The risk equally terrifying. Could he refuse? Not without breaking his oath of service. A knight's obedience superseded even a soldier's discipline.\n\nAfter a long silence, Resh forced himself to speak. \"...I'll find a way.\"\n\n*This is what knights do,* he reminded himself. *Face impossible odds. Overcome adversity. Become heroes.*\n\nBut first, he needed allies.\n\nBack in the real world, Resh had dozens of friends and contacts. Unfortunately, none of them played Satisfy at his level. He sat staring at his computer screen, mind blank, before an idea sparked.\n\n*The Chivalry forums.*\n\nHe'd joined the niche community months ago—a gathering place for players who shared his fascination with knighthood. Small in membership but long-established, many of its veterans had played since launch day. One member in particular had caught his attention: someone with the bizarre username **Pepsi is an Insurgent.**\n\n*Based on his posts, he's high level,* Resh thought, logging into the forums. *Worth a shot.*\n\n***\n\n**[Rash Guard has sent you a message.]**\n\n\"Hm?\" Lee Seonung—known in Satisfy as Coke—glanced at his smartwatch with pleasant surprise. He'd only joined Chivalry after becoming Prince Lord's personal knight, but Rash Guard had quickly become his favorite person to chat with. The guy shared information freely and actually knew his stuff.\n\nCoke opened the message:\n\n---\n\n**To: Pepsi is an Insurgent**\n\nMorning!\n\nI've been given a high-stakes assignment by my superior—infiltrating a national dungeon to retrieve a prisoner list. There's a conspiracy involved, something big.\n\nThe quest allows three players total, including myself. It's dangerous, but the rewards are incredible.\n\nIf you're above level 340 and willing to take the risk, I'd like you to join me.\n\nLet me know.\n\n— Rash Guard\n\n---\n\n\"Huh. Level 340 minimum...\" Coke stroked his chin. That explained why Rash Guard seemed so knowledgeable—the man was clearly a high ranker himself. After a moment's consideration, Coke typed his response:\n\n---\n\n**Re: Your Quest**\n\nHey there!\n\nGood news—I'm actually a bit over 340. Bad news: you said \"dangerous,\" which has me nervous. I need more details before I commit. Hope you understand!\n\n— Pepsi\n\n---\n\nThe reply came within seconds:\n\n---\n\n**Quest Details:**\n\n[Quest window attached]\n\nI've redacted some names for operational security, but everything else is accurate. As you can see, the rewards are exceptional. I'm estimating SS-rank difficulty minimum.\n\nI'm not asking you to throw your life away. Just... if you're interested, I could use the help.\n\n— RG\n\n---\n\n\"Damn.\" Coke read through the quest details twice. Three free levels, a unique skill book, *and* a title? Rash Guard's forum history checked out too—years of solid posts, no red flags. This was legitimate.\n\nExcitement bubbling up, Coke fired off another message. The conversation devolved into rapid-fire exchanges:\n\n---\n\n**Pepsi:** Already found the third member?\n\n**Rash Guard:** Not yet. Still looking.\n\n**Pepsi:** Can I recommend someone?\n\n**Rash Guard:** You're saying you'll join?\n\n**Pepsi:** Absolutely.\n\n**Rash Guard:** Then let's meet in-game first. I'll assess our strength before committing to a third. Fair?\n\n**Pepsi:** Totally fair. Though I guarantee you'll accept my recommendation.\n\n**Rash Guard:** ?\n\n**Pepsi:** I'm bringing Grid lol\n\n**Rash Guard:** lol\n\n---\n\n*What a clown,* Resh thought, frowning at his screen. Of all the times to make jokes, this wasn't it. Dropping a celebrity name for laughs felt juvenile—like a teenager desperate for attention. He was starting to regret reaching out to Pepsi at all.\n\n*Still, might as well meet him in-game. If it doesn't work out, I'll keep searching.*\n\nResh logged back into Satisfy, instructing Pepsi to send a friend request while trying not to get his hopes up.\n\nThen the notifications appeared:\n\n**[Player 'Coke' has sent you a friend request.]**\n\n**[Player 'Grid' has sent you a friend request.]**\n\nResh blinked. Then laughed.\n\n\"So he actually *knows* someone named Grid. That's something, at least.\"\n\nWith two billion players worldwide, duplicate IDs were common as dirt. The odds of this being the *actual* Overgeared King Grid? Astronomical. Still, he accepted both requests and checked his friend list.\n\n---\n\n**Name:** Coke  \n**Level:** 367  \n**Guild:** Overgeared\n\n---\n\n\"Wait, what?\"\n\n---\n\n**Name:** Grid  \n**Level:** 399  \n**Guild:** Overgeared\n\n---\n\n\"*What?!*\"\n\nThe blood drained from Resh's face. His hands trembled on the keyboard.\n\nIt was real. All of it.\n\nHe'd just recruited the actual Grid."
