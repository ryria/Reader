  "content": "In Satisfy, food served two purposes: sating hunger and restoring health. An essential energy source for every player.\n\nWhich made Idan's cooking a special kind of torture.\n\n[You have eaten spoiled food.]\n[You have received food poisoning.]\n[You have resisted.]\n[You have consumed something inedible.]\n[You have been poisoned (severe).]\n[You have resisted.]\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Well? Delicious, right?\"\n\nThe road to Kars stretched before them, winding through mountain valleys toward the capital of the Cho Kingdom. Grid trudged alongside Idan and Yang Fei, his stomach churning with every forced meal. A torture expert was torturing him with torture.\n\n*I just want something edible. Forget delicious—nine out of ten dishes are literal poison.*\n\nFeeding this slop to the Overgeared Kingdom would be a disaster. Imagine the entire government collapsing because everyone simultaneously contracted food poisoning.\n\n*The only way to improve Idan's cooking is to keep eating it.*\n\nSo Grid sacrificed himself.\n\nThroughout the journey, he forced Idan to cook meal after meal. It required inhuman willpower. Grid was descending into his own personal hell for the sake of his kingdom.\n\n\"Grid, have some tea.\"\n\nYang Fei approached as Grid's face turned green, a cup of steaming liquid in her hands. Her expression was almost sympathetic.\n\n\"Th-Thank you...\"\n\n[You have drunk Berenas Tea.]\n[Your mind and body have stabilized. Health recovery rate increased by 10% for 1 minute.]\n\nThe foul taste coating his mouth vanished. Yang Fei was a lifesaver.\n\nIntelligent, versatile, and apparently a tea master. Every plant she gathered along the road—grass, flowers, leaves, twigs—became something medicinal under her hands.\n\n\"Where did you learn this?\" Grid asked.\n\n\"Working at Idan's restaurant for several years. Sometimes customers get food poisoning and collapse...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nAn absurd answer, but it revealed Yang Fei's kind heart.\n\n*She cares about people. She'd make a great addition to the kingdom.*\n\nThe warm impression lasted about five seconds.\n\n\"It was only a matter of time before someone died. If the restaurant closed, I'd lose my job—and all my unpaid wages.\"\n\n\"...Right.\"\n\nGrid mentally revised his assessment. Yang Fei and Rabbit would get along perfectly.\n\n*Actually, if I assign Yang Fei to Rabbit, she'll support him properly. His work efficiency will skyrocket.*\n\nOne thing was certain: he couldn't let Yang Fei anywhere near Lord.\n\n*That kid makes friends with every woman regardless of age or appearance. He thinks \"lover\" means \"friend.\"*\n\nOf course, young Lord remained oblivious. The problem was the women didn't.\n\n*They all dream of marrying a prince... Wait.*\n\nA thought struck Grid as he considered his son.\n\n*What happens when the empire takes twelve-year-old Lord as a hostage?*\n\nEvery noblewoman in the imperial capital would fall for him.\n\n*My son is wonderful!*\n\nEvery parent thought their child was beautiful—even hedgehogs praised their young. Naturally, Grid believed Lord was the continent's greatest genius. His confidence towered like a mountain.\n\n*In the empire, Lord would have so much room to... No. Lord can't become a hostage.*\n\n*Clang.*\n\nGrid touched the necklace Lord had given him.\n\n*For his sake, I need enough power to resist the empire. I won't let him suffer.*\n\nBearing Idan's cooking was nothing compared to protecting his son.\n\nGrid steeled himself as Idan began butchering a freshly hunted monster.\n\n***\n\n\"This is harder than I thought.\"\n\nMuto ran a small-to-medium trading company with a monthly volume approaching ten thousand gold. Currently ranked third among all merchants, he'd come to the East Continent seeking opportunity.\n\nHis dream: pioneer new trade routes, expand his customer base, dominate the market.\n\nReality: the East Continent was brutal.\n\nNPCs refused to trade regardless of their status. High-level monsters made traveling between settlements a nightmare.\n\n*The reputation I built on the West Continent means nothing here. I'm basically starting over.*\n\nIf he could just establish a customer base, the exotic goods alone would catapult him to the top of the merchant rankings. Increased trading volume. Massive profits. A brilliant future.\n\nTen days without a single sale had dulled that enthusiasm.\n\n*If the locals believed I could travel freely between continents, business would explode.*\n\nBut they didn't. The East Continent inhabitants thought Muto had been swept here by accident—that intercontinental travel was impossible.\n\n\"Ugh. Frustrating.\"\n\nBack on the West Continent, Muto had mainly supplied Earl Butin of the Saharan Empire. The earl's territory was a noble resort, and Muto sold luxury goods there.\n\nThen Reidan started selling sand as a longevity remedy.\n\nThe nobles bought into the ridiculous formula: *Earl Butin's goods = inferior to Reidan's miracle cure.* Interest in Muto's valuables plummeted overnight. He'd become insignificant.\n\nThe East Continent was his chance to recover. Without expanding here, his company's declining trade volume would bury him.\n\n*At this rate, I'll drop to seventh rank.*\n\nLosing rank meant losing sponsors. His pride as a merchant couldn't withstand that humiliation.\n\n*Once I reach Kars, I'll meet the Cho King. If I can showcase Western culture... hm?*\n\nMuto stopped mid-stride, his hired Zentu mercenaries halting behind him.\n\nA spectacular scene unfolded in the mountain valley ahead.\n\n\"This is the secret technique passed down through my family! Filleting! My skills have been honed for this very moment!\"\n\n\"N-No, that's not a carp—that's a mermaid...\"\n\n\"It's still half fish. What's the problem?\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nA surreal sight.\n\nLevel 300 mermaid monsters trembled as a middle-aged man advanced with a kitchen knife. More impressive was the black-haired man desperately trying to stop him.\n\n*Grid...?*\n\nThe first legendary class. The first king. The most famous player in the world.\n\n*Why is he here?*\n\nCoincidence?\n\nMuto's bewildered expression transformed into a smile.\n\n*Fate.*\n\nMuto had every reason to hate Grid. Reidan's longevity remedy had destroyed his business. Grid was directly responsible for his fall. Resentment should have been natural.\n\nBut in this moment, those feelings evaporated.\n\nHe was bound to Grid by fate's strings.\n\n\"I was going to rest in that valley, but someone's already there.\"\n\n\"Should we move on?\" a mercenary asked.\n\nMuto shook his head. \"If you ask him to leave, he'll cut all your heads off.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThe mercenaries frowned. They were Zentu's strongest warriors—Muto had hired them specifically for that reputation. Yet this black-haired stranger could kill them all?\n\n\"Unacceptable,\" one muttered.\n\nZentu sat near the former queen rat community, destroyed months ago. To survive the constant rat attacks, every inhabitant had trained relentlessly, earning the title of warrior. They had immense pride in their skills.\n\n\"Let's see if he's really that strong.\"\n\nThe mercenaries' discomfort was palpable.\n\n\"Don't eat mermaids! That's basically cannibalism!\"\n\n*Peeng!*\n\n*Pepepepeok!*\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThe valley erupted.\n\nSwordsmanship and magic detonated simultaneously as the black-haired man moved.\n\n\"Th-This is impossible.\"\n\nThe mercenaries stood speechless.\n\nThey could barely handle Jam Valley mermaids one-on-one. Those creatures were comparable to the poisonous rats in strength.\n\nThe black-haired man had just slaughtered dozens in seconds. The difference in power was absolute.\n\n\"See? Different class entirely. Don't you Zentu warriors admire strength? Isn't he strong?\"\n\n*Gulp.*\n\nThe mercenaries didn't respond. They could only swallow, goosebumps crawling across their skin.\n\n*If we'd encountered him unaware...*\n\n*We'd be like those mermaids.*\n\nThe thought chilled them.\n\n*Huh?*\n\nThen they blinked.\n\nThe black-haired man had pulled out a needle and thread. He was... sewing?\n\n\"Wh-What?\"\n\nThe mercenaries stared.\n\nMuto was even more surprised.\n\n*Sewing cloth? How can Grid, a blacksmith, work with fabric?*\n\nHe wasn't just a celebrity. Every accidental encounter revealed something new. Grid was a constant source of fascination.\n\nMuto was certain now.\n\n*This is my chance.*\n\nToday's coincidental meeting would be the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\n\"Let's go. We'll introduce ourselves first.\"\n\nMuto took a deep breath to suppress his tension and excitement before approaching Grid with his mercenaries.\n\nThe smell of rotting garbage grew stronger with each step.\n\nHe didn't care."
