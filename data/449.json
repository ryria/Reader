  "content": "Grid studied the battle unfolding before him, his mind cataloging every movement. *He used stealth as an offensive tool when we fought. High specs. But can he escape the inherent limitations of the assassin class?*\n\nThe National Competition had sharpened him. Weeks of fighting elite rankers had forged his tactical mind into something keener than any blade he'd crafted. Where he once saw only immediate threats, he now perceived patterns, weaknesses, strategic openings.\n\n*Stealth works for assassination. But in open warfare?* Grid's eyes tracked Tarma's shadow manipulation. *The reappearance point becomes predictable. Once you understand the tactical situation, you can anticipate where he'll emerge. Then the advantage collapses. A single wide-range attack negates everything.*\n\nTarma was a shadow assassin. Offense, defense—both rooted in manipulating darkness. Grid had seen this style before in Winston. Kasim. The King of Shadows. That man hadn't just used his own shadow. He'd commanded every shadow cast by the NPCs around him, turning the entire environment into his weapon.\n\n*His stealth utilization was on another level entirely.*\n\nWhen Grid first heard the title \"King of Shadows,\" he'd dismissed it as posturing. Now? The memory took on new weight. Kasim was formidable. Frighteningly so.\n\n*A named NPC.*\n\nThe thought crystallized into a darker question. What if Kasim had turned that blade against him that day?\n\n*I would've died. One hundred percent.* Grid's jaw tightened. *He didn't flee because he feared me.*\n\nKasim had chosen mercy. But why?\n\n*Why spare me?*\n\nGrid turned the question over in his mind, examining it from every angle his elevated Insight allowed. The truth remained elusive. Despite the exponential growth of his stats, despite the sharpening of his perception during the competition, this mystery stayed locked away.\n\nThe King of Shadows was protecting his son, Lord. Grid simply didn't know it yet.\n\n***\n\nPvP.\n\nThe sacred ground where one-on-one combat reigned supreme. No interference. No backup. Just raw ability colliding with raw ability. Victory brought euphoria and pride. Defeat brought shame and the bitter taste of inadequacy. Here, hearts collided as violently as fists.\n\n\"WAAAHHHHHH!\"\n\nThe roar of the crowd shook the stadium. The world's greatest fighters were putting on a clinic, and every spectator felt the electricity crackling through the air.\n\nAfter dozens of preliminary matches, the 31st pairing lit up the board.\n\nChris versus Seuron. Two guild masters. Two men who commanded armies. They climbed onto the stage as the crowd's anticipation reached a fever pitch.\n\nSeuron smirked, his voice carrying across the arena. \"Well, well. Isn't this the 3rd ranked user who tucked tail and ran from me like a whipped dog?\"\n\nThe Soul Predator rolled his shoulders, his confidence bleeding into arrogance. \"Watching your pathetic performance reminded me that rankings mean nothing. Raw numbers don't equal skill. You proved that beautifully.\"\n\nThe memory was fresh in both their minds. Months ago, at the meeting of the seven guilds, tempers had flared. Words became threats. Threats became action. Seuron had demolished Chris in front of everyone. A one-sided beatdown. Chris couldn't land a single meaningful strike.\n\nBut the story wasn't that simple.\n\nChris had been hiding his true strength. Surrounded by guild masters suspicious of his connection to Grid, isolated in hostile territory, he'd made a tactical choice. Accept humiliation or risk annihilation. He'd swallowed his pride and taken the loss.\n\nNow? Different arena. Different rules.\n\nChris met Seuron's mocking gaze with steady calm. \"You're right about one thing. Rankings aren't absolute measures of strength. If they were, Zibal wouldn't be sitting at number two.\" He paused. \"But I'm different from Zibal.\"\n\n\"Kukk kuk.\" Seuron's laugh was ugly. \"I already crushed you once. What makes you think today will be any different?\"\n\n\"Watch closely.\"\n\n*Clink.*\n\nChris drew his weapon. <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Grid's Greatsword</span>, enhanced to +9 at the cost of 1.2 billion won. The blade emanated a blue-black aura wrapped in tendrils of white mist. Overbearing. Beautiful. Lethal.\n\nSeuron's eyes narrowed. \"That's Grid's weapon. So the rumors were true. You are allied with him.\"\n\n\"My weapon isn't the same as Grid's.\" Chris examined the blade with theatrical care. \"Completely different, actually.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Seuron's voice rose. \"That greatsword is identical to the one Grid wields. Same weapon, same maker. Don't insult my intelligence!\"\n\nChris shrugged, his expression innocent. \"You're mistaken. Grid's <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Greatsword</span> is only +8.\" He hefted his blade. \"Mine is +9.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nIn the standby area, Grid's head dropped. His shoulders sagged.\n\n\"Hah.\"\n\nThe sigh escaped before he could stop it. Legendary blacksmith. Pagma's Descendant. A passive skill specifically designed to boost enhancement success rates. Grid should have been drowning in +10 equipment. Should have been the walking definition of \"overgeared.\"\n\nReality? He'd succeeded in enhancing items to +8 roughly fifteen times in his entire career. +9? A pitiful three items.\n\n+10? The theoretical maximum?\n\n*Pure fantasy with my garbage luck.*\n\nGrid couldn't raise his eyes. The weight of inadequacy pressed down on him. Around him, other players shot him sympathetic glances. On stage, Chris and Seuron faced each other, weapons raised.\n\n\"I'll show you the true power of a unique-rated combat class!\" Seuron's earlier smugness had curdled into anger.\n\nChris remained unmoved. \"Classes don't win fights. Skill does.\"\n\nNo more words.\n\n*Peeng!*\n\nThe instant the referee signaled the start, Seuron exploded forward. Soul Explosion propelled him across the gap, his blade already in motion. Devastating speed. Inhuman reflexes. Maybe five people in the entire world could react to an opening that fast.\n\nChris was ranked 3rd for a reason. He hadn't climbed the rankings through a hunting-optimized class like Zibal. Chris had earned his position the hard way—through pure swordsmanship and battle sense. He was comparable to Kraugel himself in technique, if not raw power.\n\n*Peeeeeong!*\n\nSeuron's eyes widened. *He blocked it?*\n\nGreatsword users were supposed to be slow. The weapon's massive size, the stat distribution favoring Strength and Stamina over Agility, the inherent attack speed penalty—all of it added up to predictable patterns. Even Chris, who stood at the peak of greatsword mastery, suffered these limitations.\n\nBut Chris had transcended the disadvantage through perfect economy of motion. Minimal movement. Maximum efficiency. He didn't just block Seuron's strike—he deflected it, concentrated his strength, and hurled Seuron backward before launching his counterattack.\n\n*Attack and defense simultaneously!* Seuron's tactical mind raced as he summoned Soul Armor. The translucent barrier absorbed most of Chris's follow-up strike. Seuron fired Soul Arrows while still moving backward.\n\n*Pepepepeong!*\n\nRanged attacks while retreating. Textbook harassment. Especially effective when the attacks required no wind-up animations. Seuron's soul-based skills manifested instantly, their casting times minimal. This was the overwhelming advantage of a specialized combat class.\n\n\"Hup!\" Chris stopped pursuing, using his greatsword to bat away the ghostly projectiles.\n\nSeuron grinned as he reached optimal distance. Soul Transformation wrapped around his <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Brutal Heavy Sword</span>, also enhanced to +9. Blue light erupted from the blade, intensifying until it shot forward as a concentrated beam.\n\n*Swaeeeeek!*\n\nFrom the sidelines, Grid's assessment was instant. *That needs to be dodged. Blocking isn't an option.*\n\nEven a dedicated tank would suffer catastrophic damage trying to absorb that strike with a shield. If Chris tried to block with his greatsword, he'd take massive damage and risk destroying his weapon's durability. Grid would use Revolve or evade entirely. The attack was too sharp, too fast to risk anything else.\n\nChris had different ideas.\n\nGreatsword users with low Agility couldn't rely on dodging. Chris understood his class's limitations and made a calculated choice. He abandoned defense entirely and swung for a mutual exchange.\n\n*Seokeok!*\n\n*Puok!*\n\n\"Ack!\" Chris grunted.\n\n\"Hup!\" Seuron exhaled sharply.\n\nBoth fighters recoiled, but Chris had taken the worse end of the trade. His greatsword bit deep into Seuron's shoulder, but Seuron's blade had pierced Chris's heart. Critical damage. Blood sprayed across the arena floor.\n\nSeuron's confidence surged. *Victory.*\n\nHe recovered his defensive posture, summoned Soul Spear to trap Chris in place while dealing continuous damage, then thrust forward to finish the combo. But he'd underestimated Chris's class. The Tyrant's unique resilience was monstrous. Chris powered through the stiffness that should have locked his muscles, ignored the soul bombardment tearing at his health, and poured more strength into his grip.\n\n*Ttududuk!*\n\n\"Kuaaaaak!\" Seuron's scream echoed as Chris's greatsword carved deeper into his shoulder, driving him to his knees.\n\nThe thrust went wide. The battlefield inverted. Chris activated Tyrant's Oppression, each strike of the fatal combo dealing catastrophic damage. Seuron desperately deployed Soul Prison, trying to create space and stabilize, but Chris's raw power was overwhelming. His health bar plummeted into red.\n\n> **[Victory! Chris!!]**\n\n\"WAHHHHH!\"\n\n\"NOW THAT'S A HIGH RANKER!\"\n\n\"NOTHING LIKE ZIBAL'S PERFORMANCE!\"\n\nThe fierce battle ignited the Stade de France. The crowd was on their feet, voices hoarse from screaming.\n\n> **[Now! Let's introduce the competitors for the next round!]**\n\n> **[The Miracle of the Continent! The Dragon of China! Genius at fighting—Hao!!]**\n\n> **[The monster who won four gold medals and carried South Korea to the top of the standings! The first legendary class! Pagma's Descendant—Grid!!]**\n\n\"Finally,\" someone in the crowd muttered. \"The main event.\"\n\nGrid walked onto the stage. <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Iyarugt</span> hung at his side, the blood-red blade scattering jewel-like light that made spectators shield their eyes. Beautiful. Terrible. Alive.\n\nHao's voice cut through the noise. \"Ten minutes. I'll knock you down in ten minutes.\"\n\nHis eyes burned with conviction. Grid wanted to become the new sky? Ridiculous. Kraugel was the only sky, and someday, Hao would shatter even that absolute peak.\n\nGrid's response was delivered with complete seriousness.\n\n\"I'll take one hour. I'll knock you out just before the time limit expires.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThe entire stadium seemed to pause. Grid, who typically demolished opponents in under three minutes, was declaring a prolonged battle? The commentators exchanged confused glances. The crowd's murmur rose to a confused roar.\n\nWhy did it feel like the two fighters had somehow reversed their expected roles?"
