This monster who'd just torn through Zibal like wet paper? The absurdity of the claim would've been laughable under different circumstances, but fear choked out any mockery before it could reach their throats.\n\nTheir master's blood still dripped from the hand plow in Piaro's grip. Dark crimson drops fell into the sand, each one a reminder of what awaited them.\n\n*That thing killed Zibal. If it touches me, I'm dead. Completely dead.*\n\nThe penalty for dying was brutal. Experience loss. Item drops. The possibility of losing days, even weeks of progress. And they were supposed to charge that?\n\n\"What are you doing?\" An executive's voice cracked through the paralysis. \"The opponent is your master's enemy! Get revenge, even if you have to sacrifice your lives!\"\n\nThe words hit like cold water. The Snake Guild members straightened. They couldn't retreat. Not here. Not now. Their guild's reputation hung in the balance. One show of cowardice and they'd become a laughingstock, hemorrhaging members until nothing remained but a disbanded husk.\n\n*Fuck it.* One player's jaw clenched. *Yes. I'll die. Better that than watching everything we built collapse.*\n\n*I'll kill him. Even if it costs me everything.*\n\nThe guild had given them too much. Power. Status. A place in the hierarchy. They couldn't let it crumble.\n\nDetermination rippled through the ranks and reached Piaro.\n\nHis smile widened.\n\n*How many battlefields have I seen?* Memories flooded back. Days as a Red Knight, when war was his life and the battlefield was home. Surrounded by hundreds of enemies, fighting alongside brothers-in-arms. His pulse quickened. Blood sang in his veins.\n\n\"This is exciting.\"\n\nNo holding back this time. No measured sparring. Just pure, unrestricted combat. A chance to unleash the Supreme Swordsmanship he'd honed through months of fieldwork and duels with worthy opponents.\n\nHe moved.\n\nThe hoe plunged forward.\n\n\"Keok—\" A Snake Guild member's cry cut short as the tool punched through his sternum. Months of agricultural work had made Piaro intimately familiar with the hoe's balance and reach. He'd closed the distance before the man even registered the threat.\n\nThe body crumpled.\n\n\"You bastard!\" Another guild member roared. First Zibal, now their comrades, all killed by *farming equipment*. The humiliation burned hotter than fear. Rage overtook survival instinct.\n\nExactly what Piaro wanted.\n\nHe withdrew the hoe in a spray of crimson and shifted into Supreme Swordsmanship, 5th style. Light coalesced into geometric patterns, forming a luminous square that whirled around the charging enemies. The technique covered everything within its radius. No defense. No escape. Blood erupted from a dozen bodies at once, painting intricate patterns across the sand like a macabre spider's web.\n\nPiaro stood at the eye of the storm, untouched. Not a single drop stained his clothes.\n\nHis gaze found Asuka.\n\n*Strong.* He recognized it instantly. This was the berserker who'd pushed Grid to his limits once. Real skill radiated from her stance.\n\n\"How dare you aim for the Young Lady!\" Black Teddy's voice boomed. Five summoning circles flared to life.\n\nWhite bears materialized, each wearing sunglasses and flowing red cloaks. The Cola Bears moved with trained precision, their martial arts forms tight and coordinated as they intercepted Piaro's advance.\n\nFast. Strong. Their formation had no obvious gaps. Most third advancement users would struggle against this squad.\n\nBut Piaro wasn't most users.\n\nThe hoe caught a claw strike. The hand plow answered with brutal efficiency.\n\n> [Cola Bear 1 has disappeared.]\n\nBlock. Counter.\n\n> [Cola Bear 3 has disappeared.]\n\n\"Heok—\" Black Teddy's breath caught.\n\nThe bears fell like wheat before a scythe. No resistance. No contest.\n\n*Different dimension.* The realization hit Black Teddy like a physical blow. *He's on a completely different level.*\n\nThe Snake Guild executives watched in mounting horror.\n\n*Where did Grid find this monster?*\n\nNamed NPCs were legendary for a reason. You didn't just stumble across them in random villages. Recruiting one required exceptional quests, perfect timing, astronomical luck. They shaped entire kingdoms, toppled dynasties, rewrote the balance of power. The idea of a player actually commanding one as a subordinate was fantasy.\n\nYet here stood proof. Grid had done the impossible.\n\nAnd the NPC was a *farmer*.\n\nJealousy couldn't even take root. There was only awe. Shock. The growing understanding that Grid existed in a category all his own.\n\nPiaro's hand plow struck three times in rapid succession.\n\n> [You have suffered 7,350 damage.]\n\n> [You have suffered 7,350 damage.]\n\n> [You have suffered 7,350 damage.]\n\n\"Heeok?\" Black Teddy's strangled gasp was his last sound. Fixed damage. Pure qi manifestation that ignored every point of defense he'd carefully built.\n\nThe first ranked summoner died to a farming implement.\n\nAt least he'd have company in the death announcements. Better to share the humiliation with Zibal than bear it alone.\n\n> [You have died.]\n\nThe watching crowd stood frozen. When Zibal fell, people could rationalize it. Maybe Piaro had a one-hit kill skill. A lucky crit. Some fluke.\n\nBut this? Three measured strikes, each dealing identical damage. This was base attack power. Raw, terrifying strength that made even Hurent's Aura Master look tame by comparison.\n\nWho could survive that?\n\nAmong the stone-faced observers, Asuka's eyes blazed. A berserker thrived in crisis. The passive **Berserk** skill twisted fear into fuel. Terror transformed into euphoria. Her aggressive instincts peaked.\n\n\"I'll get revenge for what Grid did to me!\" She yanked <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Ainas' Sickle</span> from her inventory. \"By killing his subordinate!\"\n\nPiaro's expression softened. \"Please have strength.\"\n\n*Not exactly his subordinate,* he thought, *but close enough.*\n\nChains rattled as Asuka hurled the sickle. The weapon shot forward like a striking viper, its tip gleaming.\n\n\"Good skill.\" Piaro raised his hoe to intercept.\n\nMetal screamed against metal.\n\n*Got you!* Asuka's grin was savage. She seized the chain and yanked, using the hooked blade as an anchor to drag Piaro toward her.\n\n\"Impressive technique and strength.\" The farmer allowed himself to be pulled.\n\nAs the distance closed, Asuka dropped the chain and drew <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Euprates' Greatsword</span>. The massive blade warped the air around it, reality bending under its power. Tycoon money bought the best equipment, and she had several legendary items to prove it.\n\n\"Die!\" The greatsword carved through space. **Madness' Wrath**, the ultimate skill of her third advancement class, channeled through the legendary weapon.\n\nPiaro's excited expression cooled to neutral assessment.\n\n\"Your greatsword techniques are lacking.\" His voice was clinical. \"Especially compared to Duke Grid.\"\n\nAsuka ranked thirty-first overall. The guild's second strongest. On paper, she matched the Overgeared members in raw power.\n\nBut paper meant nothing here.\n\nSupreme Swordsmanship, 4th style, met **Madness' Wrath**. The collision didn't explode. It simply... stopped. The ultimate skill neutralized completely, its energy dissipating like morning mist.\n\nThe 1st style followed instantly.\n\n*Crack.* Hairline fractures spider-webbed across the legendary greatsword.\n\nThe hand plow struck.\n\n> [You have suffered fatal damage!]\n\n\"Kyak!\" Asuka's scream tore free. Two-thirds of her health vanished in a single hit.\n\nBerserkers invested everything in **Strength** and **Agility**. Defense was for cowards. She'd lived by that philosophy for years.\n\nNow it was killing her.\n\nBut she didn't stay down. Couldn't. A berserker grew stronger with injury. Her physical abilities scaled with lost health. Blood loss meant power gain.\n\nShe pushed herself upright, muscles screaming. \"The real fight starts now!\"\n\n<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Heroic Death Spear</span> replaced the damaged greatsword. Asuka whirled the weapon in complex patterns, shaft and blade blurring together.\n\nPiaro watched with growing disappointment. \"Your spearsmanship is unremarkable compared to Viscount Pon.\"\n\nThe hoe caught the spear mid-thrust. The hand plow answered.\n\nDual-wielding farming tools. Combining judgment with centuries of combat experience. The technique was absurd. Deadly. Impossible to counter.\n\n*Thud.* The hand plow cracked against her forehead.\n\n\"Ahat!\" Stars exploded across Asuka's vision. Her health bar dropped to critical levels.\n\nThis was ridiculous. She'd trained for years. Fought her way to the top rankings. Invested millions into legendary equipment.\n\nAnd a farmer with hand tools was destroying her.\n\nTeeth gritted, she raised <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Ainas' Sickle</span> again. Enhanced physical abilities from her passive drove her forward. She aimed for mutual destruction, trading bones and flesh to land one solid hit.\n\nBut Piaro's defense was impenetrable. The hoe and hand plow wove a barrier that gave only despair. Every attack deflected. Every opening a feint.\n\nAsuka fell.\n\nAnother name added to the \"killed by hand plow\" list. The rumors would be merciless.\n\nBox, the Snake Guild's chief of staff, processed the battle with cold calculation.\n\n*We can't win.* \n\nThe conclusion was inescapable. Piaro existed on a different plane. Perfect technique married to overwhelming stats created a wall that current players couldn't scale. Box would bet money that even Kraugel, the first ranked player, would struggle to land a clean hit.\n\n*Level 360 minimum.* That was the threshold. Anything less was suicide.\n\nWhich meant they needed a new strategy.\n\n\"We'll tie up his feet!\" Box's shout cut through the chaos. \"Seuron! Hao! Smash Reidan while we keep him busy!\"\n\nRetreat wasn't an option. Not empty-handed. Their initial objective still stood. Devastate Reidan. Slow Grid's expansion. Anything to maintain the balance of power.\n\nIf it cost the Snake Guild everything? So be it.\n\nSeuron and Hao exchanged relieved grins.\n\n\"Good judgment.\"\n\nFighting Piaro had zero appeal. Retreat had seemed cowardly, but now? The Snake Guild was gift-wrapping an excuse to ignore the farmer.\n\nThree more farmers blocked the path to Reidan. So what? Named NPCs weren't common as dirt. These three were probably pushovers. Regular agricultural workers who couldn't match Piaro.\n\nSoul Predator Seuron took point. Souls of fallen Snake Guild members swirled around him, their essence feeding his power. Three spectral spears materialized, each one thrumming with lethal energy.\n\n\"Get lost.\" The spears launched.\n\n**Soul Spears** was a unique skill, capable of delivering killing blows to even top-ranked players. Against farmers? It would be instant execution.\n\nMetal rang against magic. One farmer, casually munching a potato, gestured. A spell formation blazed to life and annihilated a spear mid-flight.\n\n\"What?!\"\n\nSeuron's eyes bulged. Behind him, two hundred and eleven Golden Guild members froze.\n\nThe second farmer raised a shield. Two more spears crashed into it and... stopped. No explosion. No breakthrough. Just gentle deflection.\n\n\"What are these guys?\" Seuron's mind raced. Another named NPC? Two of them?\n\n*Find a hole. There has to be a weakness.*\n\nHis gaze locked on the third farmer. The only one who hadn't moved yet.\n\n\"That one!\" Seuron jabbed a finger. \"He's just a normal farmer! Break through him!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" The Golden Guild surged forward as one.\n\nThe farmer watched them come. A smile played across his lips.\n\nKraugel drew his weapon.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms:**\n\n**OG:** Glossary Link\n\n*Current schedule: 20 chapters a week.*\n\n*Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
