  "content": "# Chapter: Crisis and Catalyst\n\n**[Golden Walnut]**\n\n*Also called the blessing of nature.*\n\n*A delicacy and restorative enjoyed by the nobility and royalty of the East Continent. Certain creatures on that distant land subsist almost entirely on these walnuts.*\n\n*Effects: Increases all stats by 10% for one hour. Additionally, grants a minute chance to permanently raise a single stat by 5 points. The precision of shelling directly correlates with the probability of permanent enhancement.*\n\n*Weight: 0.1*\n\n\"The ultimate buff potion and elixir rolled into one...\" Lauel murmured, studying the golden walnut Grid had handed him. His eyes widened as he reached the description's final lines. \"And the Eastern nobility eat these as *snacks*?\"\n\n\"Which means their baseline stats are probably ridiculous,\" Grid confirmed. \"Especially if they've been munching on these things since childhood.\"\n\n\"Maybe not.\" Lauel's brow furrowed. \"It can't be easy to shell them perfectly—not like you can. Still...\" He exhaled slowly. \"The Eastern aristocracy is clearly operating on a different level. If we could replicate that advantage for the Overgeared Guild...\" He looked up, a spark of hope in his expression. \"Tell Piaro to make growing these walnuts his top priority.\"\n\n\"...Understood.\"\n\nThe word came out heavy, and Grid immediately understood why.\n\n*The odds of cultivating something this broken? Basically zero.*\n\nThe S.A. Group obsessed over game balance. They'd never make farming golden walnuts easy—if they allowed it at all.\n\n*But...*\n\nPiaro was a Legend. And Legends rewrote the rules. The system itself seemed to bend for them, granting latitude it denied everyone else.\n\n*He can create entirely new cultivation techniques, just like I forge impossible items and Kraugel invents sword forms.*\n\nIt was optimistic thinking, maybe even naïve. Grid allowed himself a rueful smile as he clapped Lauel on the shoulder.\n\n\"Don't sweat it. I'll bring back more walnuts when I return to the East Continent.\"\n\n\"...I'll await your return faithfully, Your Majesty.\" Lauel straightened, some of his old fire rekindling. \"And don't worry about governance. The old Lauel is gone—these encounters with my past comrades have forged me into something stronger. That strength will be the Overgeared Kingdom's fortune... Your Majesty? Where are you—?\"\n\nBut Grid was already moving.\n\n*Step. Step.*\n\nThey'd just been declared a vassal state. The Saharan Empire loomed over them like an executioner's blade. Four months—that's all the breathing room they had. Four months before the kingdom collapsed and every won Grid had invested turned to ash.\n\n*No time to waste.*\n\nWhile Lauel called after him, Grid cut across the palace grounds toward the Overgeared Academy.\n\nHis pace was brisk—almost as fast as the kingdom's famed soldiers, whose physical conditioning was the stuff of legend among other nations' forces. His agility had climbed steadily to maintain a 1:1 ratio with his strength stat, finally breaking through 2,700. Just 500 more points to perfect equilibrium.\n\n***\n\nThe Overgeared Academy sprawled across several acres in Reinhardt's educational district—a comprehensive institution open to anyone over eight years old, teaching both swordsmanship and magic. But space remained limited. Current enrollment: 3,000 students. Over half received direct instruction from Sticks himself.\n\nIt was a crisis of success. Every department was overworked, drowning in students they couldn't properly serve. Sticks bore the heaviest burden.\n\nAs a high elf and a sage, Sticks commanded respect from all elven-kind. Even the Saharan Emperor would receive him with full honors. Yet here he was, teaching commoners in a fledgling kingdom. If word spread across the continent, it would cause a diplomatic earthquake.\n\nThe citizens of Overgeared, blissfully ignorant of their instructor's legendary status, simply appreciated how much easier and faster they learned under his guidance.\n\n\"Harmony between humanity—a species that thrives on change—and elementals—beings devoted to nature's preservation—is inherently difficult,\" Sticks explained to his advanced students. \"Throughout history, contracts between humans and elementals occur perhaps once in a century. Multiple conditions must align perfectly...\"\n\n\"Sticks!\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThe sage turned, startled, as Grid burst through the lecture hall doors. The room erupted.\n\n\"Wahhh!\"\n\n\"King Grid!\"\n\n\"Your Majesty, I love you!\"\n\nThe students' adoration ran deep. Grid had given them something most commoners never received: genuine educational opportunity, regardless of birth or status. The advanced students—handpicked for their motivation and talent—loved him even more fiercely.\n\n\"I'm Adon—first place in the last examination!\" A boy shot to his feet, eyes shining. \"When I graduate, I want to serve you directly, King Grid!\"\n\n\"I'm Shannon, and I'll be first in the *next* test!\" another student declared. \"Please remember that I'm working this hard to become someone worthy of serving Your Majesty!\"\n\nPride and gratitude wove through every word. The students' burning enthusiasm, their eager faces—it pushed back the cold dread of the empire's ultimatum, if only for a moment.\n\n\"I'll be watching for that day,\" Grid said, and meant it.\n\nOnce, he'd pursued kingship purely for personal gain. More tax revenue meant eating whatever he wanted, buying whatever caught his eye. That dream hadn't changed—Grid still had expensive tastes and zero shame about it.\n\nBut he'd learned something: his greed only flourished if his people prospered. Wealthy citizens paid better taxes. Simple economics.\n\nGrid was selfish. But he wasn't the Emperor. He had no interest in grinding the poor beneath his heel. How could he? Grid had spent most of his life deprived, scraping by, intimately familiar with that particular suffering. His selfishness didn't demand innocent victims—just comfort, security, and maybe some really good food.\n\n\"An imperial envoy arrived, didn't they?\" Sticks' keen eyes studied Grid's urgency. \"I assume it's bad news.\"\n\nGrid nodded. \"Send me to the East Continent. And this time—\" He pointed emphatically. \"—don't forget my return scroll.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*This ungrateful...*! Sticks' eye twitched. Grid was still blaming him for that incident, even though the lack of a return scroll had nothing to do with Sticks' competence. The sage sighed and retrieved both an East Continent movement scroll and a West Continent return scroll from his spatial storage.\n\n\"There's something you should understand.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Reinhardt lacks the proper environment for scroll creation. I must return to the Behen Archipelago to craft them, and each scroll requires twenty-eight days to produce.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid's mind raced. If Sticks left for a month, the Academy would have to suspend classes entirely—they simply didn't have enough qualified instructors. Which meant...\n\n*I get exactly one shot at this.*\n\nOriginally, his plan for the East Continent had been straightforward: recruit Idan, whose cooking could boost the Overgeared members' stats, and secure elite troops plus diplomatic support through Han Seokbong's connections.\n\n*But that's not enough anymore.*\n\nThe East Continent wasn't some casual vacation spot he could visit on a whim. If this was his only trip for the foreseeable future...\n\n*I need to return with an army.*\n\n***\n\n**[You have used the Intercontinental Movement Scroll.]**\n\n**[You have arrived in Pangea, a starter village on the East Continent.]**\n\nThe world blurred and reformed. Grid blinked against the sudden sunlight, momentarily awed by Sticks' craftsmanship—then immediately noticed something wrong.\n\n*Why does everyone look like they're attending a funeral?*\n\nLast time Grid had been here, Pangea was thriving. He'd reproduced the legendary Red Phoenix Bow. Eradicated the armored needle infestation. Restored peace. The town should be more vibrant than ever.\n\nInstead, every face on the street carried the same haunted expression—grief, fear, despair. The marketplace stood eerily quiet, merchants staring at the cobblestones instead of hawking their wares. Passersby trudged past with heads down, shoulders slumped.\n\n*What the hell happened?*\n\nSua flashed through Grid's mind first—the lord's daughter who'd earned her people's genuine love and respect.\n\n*Did something happen to her?*\n\nDespite her... unique personality quirks, Grid held genuine affection for Sua. Yes, she was beautiful—arguably as stunning as Irene. But that wasn't why he cared. Sua was *good*. Despite her noble birth, she carried no arrogance. She'd fought the armored needles alongside common soldiers, risking her life for Pangea's stability and peace.\n\n*...Even if she is a complete pervert.*\n\nGrid turned toward Pangea Castle. A slender hand shot out and seized his wrist.\n\nThe hand belonged to Yang Fei—the young waitress from Idan's restaurant. Her usually impassive face showed... color? Emotion?\n\n\"Oh! It's been a while.\" Grid smiled, genuinely pleased. \"How have you—\"\n\nYang Fei's cheeks flushed, but her eyes darted around nervously. Before Grid could finish his greeting, she yanked him into a narrow alley.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nShe planted her hand against the wall beside Grid's head, caging him in. A girl barely out of childhood had just pinned him against brick? Grid's brain short-circuited.\n\n\"W-What—why are we...\" He swallowed hard. \"Y-You're not going to...\"\n\n*Has she caught the pervert disease too?*\n\n*Eastern Continent women are really something else...*\n\nGrid's heart hammered. Against his better judgment, anticipation flickered through his chest.\n\nThen Yang Fei shouted.\n\n\"Why?! Why did you come back?!\"\n\n\"...Huh?\"\n\nThe raw emotion in her voice shattered Grid's ridiculous fantasy. This girl—who never showed feeling, who maintained perfect composure even during the armored needle crisis—was trembling. Her eyes were wild, almost panicked.\n\nGrid's expression hardened. \"What happened?\"\n\nAnd then—\n\n\"*Sob...*\"\n\nYang Fei's shoulders shook. Tears spilled down her cheeks—all the fear and grief she'd been holding back for weeks finally breaking free at the sight of someone she trusted.\n\n\"Lord Han Seokbong and Lady Sua... they were dragged to the capital...\"\n\n\"The capital? You mean the capital of the Cho Kingdom?\"\n\n\"Yes...\" Her voice cracked. \"The King wanted to know where Grid was. Lord Han Seokbong refused to tell him, so they branded him a traitor.\"\n\n\"My whereabouts?\" Grid's stomach dropped. \"Why would—\"\n\nThen it clicked.\n\n*He wants the blacksmith who created a Red Phoenix Bow superior to the original.*\n\nWhy were people in power always the same? Always grasping, always taking, never satisfied. Grid's jaw clenched, teeth grinding.\n\n\"You have to run!\" Yang Fei grabbed his shoulders, urgent. \"If you stay here, the King's soldiers will capture you. Please—\"\n\nThe truth was, Yang Fei had missed Grid more than anyone. Some nights, lying awake, she could still feel the ghost of his touch. But she'd choose his safety over her own longing without hesitation. For someone who'd spent her youth burdened by family obligations, survival, and endless work... Grid was something different. He was *joy*. She needed him to stay safe, even if it meant never seeing him again.\n\n\"Don't worry.\"\n\nGrid pulled her into a gentle embrace, steadying her trembling. \"It'll be fine.\"\n\nThe gesture was meant to comfort, but Yang Fei's entire system overloaded. Her face, neck, and ears flushed crimson.\n\nGrid's mind, meanwhile, was already racing ahead.\n\n*This is a quest trigger.*\n\nAnd right on cue—\n\n**[★Hidden Quest★ 'Rescue the Han Seokbong Father and Daughter' has been acquired.]**\n\nA new chapter of Grid's story had begun."
