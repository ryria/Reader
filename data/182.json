It was a *production* class. The forums erupted. Was this intended? Was it a bug?\n\nGrid crushed Aura Master Hurent in five seconds flat. Four seconds later, Bondre joined him in the dirt. His world debut sent shockwaves through Satisfy's entire player base. Millions watched the strongest competitors crumble in single exchanges.\n\nThe S.A. Group's servers buckled under the flood of complaints.\n\nChairman Lim Cheolho stood before the cameras, jaw set.\n\n\"The balance is intact.\" His voice cut through the press room. \"Pagma's Descendant is performing exactly as designed. This is not a bug.\"\n\nHe let the statement settle before continuing.\n\n\"Nine legendary classes exist in Satisfy. Nine chosen players. All of them share one trait: immunity to crowd control. This passive applies to every legendary class without exception.\"\n\nA reporter raised her hand. \"Isn't that privilege excessive?\"\n\n\"What would you prefer?\" Lim Cheolho's expression didn't change. \"Fairness for its own sake? A world where effort and luck mean nothing? Where everyone ends up identical regardless of their choices?\"\n\nThe room stayed silent.\n\n\"We understand the concern.\" He leaned forward. \"Normal classes may feel disadvantaged now. But Satisfy rewards *everyone*, not just the elite. You've already experienced it yourselves.\"\n\nThe projection behind him shifted, displaying stat growth curves.\n\n\"Second advancement classes saw massive power spikes. Third advancement will narrow the gap further. Fourth advancement exists beyond that. Hidden classes may lead the charge, but dedication will close the distance. Play to your potential, and you *will* catch up.\"\n\nLim Cheolho, creator of the world's first true virtual reality, had maintained an immaculate record. One year and eight months since launch. Not a single confirmed bug. His credibility was absolute.\n\nThe controversy died within hours.\n\n***\n\n\"I never thought I'd lie to the world.\"\n\nBack in his office, Lim Cheolho's shoulders sagged. He stared at the wall of monitors, each displaying a different region of Satisfy.\n\n*Pagma's Descendant was intended to be this strong. It's not a bug.*\n\nTechnically true. The class wasn't bugged. But Grid had exceeded every projection they'd made.\n\nThe problem was simple. Grid should have been weaker. Much weaker.\n\n\"The penalty system...\" He pulled up Grid's progression data.\n\nThe design was elegant. Craft five legendary items, trigger the milestone. Stats stop scaling from Unique-rated crafts. Force the player to rely on combat instead of production. Push them toward balance.\n\nExcept Grid took forever to reach that threshold.\n\n\"Four months late.\" Lim Cheolho rubbed his temples. \"He was supposed to hit the milestone four months earlier.\"\n\nGrid's lack of talent had saved him. His incompetence became an advantage. Every hour wasted, every failed attempt, every piece of garbage he created—it all added up. He'd farmed stats long past the intended cap. The minus-level incident compounded the issue, resetting his position and forcing him to grind even longer.\n\nBlind luck. Catastrophic misfortune transforming into overwhelming power.\n\n\"A true protagonist.\" Lim Cheolho's laugh was dry. \"Only Grid could stumble backward into success.\"\n\nThe Pope Drevigo raid proved it. Grid had declared himself the protagonist, and reality bent to accommodate him. He toppled a corrupt church, saved thousands of believers, and enabled Damian's ascension to Goddess' Agent.\n\nEvery action Grid took reshaped Satisfy's landscape.\n\nBut.\n\n\"He's not the only protagonist.\"\n\nThe supercomputer's voice filled the room.\n\n> [Current Time: 13:01:27. Quest RD-3991X Complete.]\n\n\"Show me.\"\n\nThe central monitor expanded. Dozens of feeds converged on a single figure.\n\nID: Kraugel. Rank 1 since launch. The first to reach Level 300, and now, the first to achieve third advancement.\n\nA normal class player who'd earned the title of Sword Saint Candidate.\n\n\"Quest RD-3991X...\" Lim Cheolho leaned closer. \"White Swordsman?\"\n\nThe feed showed endless white plains. Snow unmarred by footprints. Kraugel stood at the threshold between continents, the first user to cross from West to East.\n\n*He'll devour every first-clear title on that continent. The bonuses will stack. He'll become something truly unique.*\n\nLim Cheolho watched Kraugel's avatar disappear into the blizzard.\n\n\"Morpheus. Hypothetical match. Current Grid versus current Kraugel. Who wins?\"\n\n> [Kraugel victory probability: 51.3%]\n\n\"Even before his new titles...?\"\n\nThe world had never been fair. Lim Cheolho existed as a singular genius in science. Kraugel existed as a singular genius in games. Both stood alone at their peaks.\n\nBut Grid existed too. Grid, who'd surpassed genius after genius through sheer stubborn persistence. Grid, who'd begun gathering the best players under his banner while Kraugel remained solitary.\n\n*Could Grid eventually surpass even Kraugel?*\n\nLim Cheolho smiled.\n\nThe throne at the top of his world. Would it belong to the genius or the fool? Either way, the answer would be fascinating.\n\n***\n\nChris, 3rd on the unified rankings and master of the Giant Guild, had known from the start.\n\n*My finals opponent will be Grid.*\n\nRound of 32: Grid versus Hurent. Everyone predicted Hurent's victory. The winner would face Bondre in the round of 16, and that victor would reach the finals.\n\nChris saw it differently. Grid would crush both Hurent and Bondre, then climb to the final match.\n\n\"But five seconds?\" He shook his head. \"Then four? I didn't see *that* coming.\"\n\nFear didn't touch him. His nerves hummed with anticipation instead. Blood pumping hot.\n\n\"I deal killing blows too.\"\n\nHis greatsword was an extension of his body. Far superior technique compared to Grid's wild swings. Stats meant nothing if you couldn't land a hit. His ultimate strike would cleave through Grid's armor like paper.\n\nHe'd been waiting for this. Revenge for the day the 'Butcher' shattered the Giant Guild in Winston.\n\nThe round of 16 arrived.\n\nHis opponent blocked the path to Grid.\n\nBritish representative Regas. Someone Chris had dismissed entirely.\n\n*In L.T.S., Regas was untouchable. But I had a six-month head start in Satisfy. This should be easy.*\n\nExcept nothing was easy.\n\n\"Cough!\" Chris hit the stone floor hard, greatsword clattering from his grip.\n\nRegas was a storm. Kicks blurred from impossible angles. Martial arts brilliance layered over brutal striking power. Reading the patterns was like trying to catch lightning.\n\nChris's health bar dropped to half in seconds. He checked his potion cooldown.\n\n*Need time.*\n\n\"What?\" Chris coughed blood. \"You're twice as strong as you were in target processing. What changed?\"\n\nIn that event, Regas had struggled against 33rd-ranked Med. No contest against Chris. How had days transformed him?\n\nRegas held up his hands. Metal gleamed across his knuckles.\n\n\"Having a weapon makes a very big difference.\"\n\nIce flooded Chris's veins. *Bare hands. He's been fighting with bare hands this entire time.*\n\n\"You...!\" Chris's eyes widened. \"You've been playing without weapons?!\"\n\nRegas nodded.\n\n\"I thought weapons were a luxury for martial artists. This competition is different. Against the strongest opponents, I owe them my best.\"\n\n> **[Lightning Duke's Knuckles]**\n> \n> Rating: <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Unique</span>\n> Durability: 107/149 | Attack Power: **201**\n> \n> * Armor Penetration **+15%**\n> * Electric Attribute **+30%**\n> * Critical Hit Chance **+30%**\n> * **5th combo:** Additional physical damage\n> * **6th combo:** Additional electrical damage\n> * **8th combo:** Additional physical and lightning damage\n> * **10th combo:** Thunder Chariot activates\n> \n> Knuckles forged by the great blacksmith 'G,' combining lightning stones with blue orichalcum.

The S.A. Group had an internal file labeled simply: \"Madman.\"\n\n*Crack!* Thunder burst from the impact point.\n\n> [5th combo achieved! Additional physical damage applied.]\n\n*Boom!* Electricity arced across Chris's armor.\n\n> [6th combo achieved! Additional lightning damage applied.]\n\n*CRASH!* The combination attack lifted Chris off his feet.\n\n> [8th combo achieved! Additional physical and lightning damage applied.]\n\nThe final blow lit up the arena.\n\n> [10th combo achieved! Thunder Chariot activated.]\n\n*KRAKA-BOOM!*\n\nLightning consumed the Lion's Castle. Stone exploded. Walls that had stood for centuries disintegrated. The symbol of Bonkost Principality's former glory collapsed into smoking rubble.\n\nThe commentators' voices rang out over the roar.\n\n『 Chris has been eliminated! 』\n\nOne of the tournament favorites, gone. Beaten by 13th-ranked Regas. The crowd sat in stunned silence.\n\nCanada's section erupted in fury. Their bronze medal hopes, shattered.\n\n『 The semifinals are set. Three of the four remaining fighters belong to the Tzedakah Guild. 』\n\n『 Grid, Regas, and Pon. The strongest guild in Satisfy is proving its dominance. 』\n\nJishuka watched from the stands, fists clenched. She cheered for all of them.\n\nBut especially for Grid.\n\n***\n\nSemifinals: Pon versus Regas. Seventeen minutes of lightning-fast spear strikes dancing against Taekwondo's fluid brutality. The crowd screamed themselves hoarse.\n\nRegas won by the thinnest margin.\n\nPon grasped his hand afterward. \"Next time, I'll win.\"\n\n\"I'll be ready.\" Their friendship deepened in defeat.\n\nGrid faced 25th-ranked Bubat in the other semifinal.\n\nBubat forfeited immediately.\n\n\"Fighting someone immune to my entire kit? Waste of time.\"\n\nThe finals followed without delay.\n\nGrid versus Regas.\n\nThis time, Grid couldn't dominate. Regas landed his combo chain, reaching the 8th strike. Grid's health dropped into the danger zone.\n\nThen **+9 Failure** reminded everyone why legendary weapons were legendary.\n\nThe tide reversed. Regas's defense crumpled under the greatsword's overwhelming attack power.\n\n*Items matter.* Regas felt his pride as a martial artist crack and crumble. *They matter more than I wanted to admit.*\n\nThe final blow fell.\n\n『 Grid wins! South Korea claims third place overall! 』\n\nThe country that had been predicted to leave empty-handed. The team dismissed as having no medal potential. Two gold medals. Third place.\n\nSouth Korea exploded in celebration. Fireworks over Seoul. Champagne in Paris.\n\n**Overall Rankings:**\n\n1st Place: United States (3 Gold, 2 Silver, 1 Bronze)\n2nd Place: France (2 Gold, 1 Silver, 2 Bronze)\n3rd Place: South Korea (2 Gold)\n4th Place: Canada (1 Gold, 2 Silver)\n\nOne event remained: the Pet Marathon.\n\n\"Grid's role is finished.\"\n\nAmerica would cement first place. France might steal it. Canada could reclaim third.\n\nThe pet marathon belonged to drake users.\n\n『 Fewer than one hundred drake pets exist in all of Satisfy. 』\n\n『 Drakes possess tremendous speed, stamina, and combat power. Countries with multiple drakes will dominate this event. 』\n\n『 Grid has registered for the marathon. Does he own a drake? 』\n\n『 Even if he does, Korea has no other drake users. The other countries will gang up on Grid's pet immediately. He'll be eliminated fast. 』\n\n『 South Korea will finish fourth. 』\n\nThe analysis was sound. Players couldn't participate directly. Only pets. Unless Grid's pet had legendary rank like its master, victory was impossible. All drakes shared the same base stats. Only their elemental attributes differed.\n\nYurea Island materialized around forty players. An island the size of Jeju, converted into a massive racetrack.\n\n\"Summon Drake!\"\n\n*ROAAAAAR!*\n\n*SCREEEEE!*\n\nFire, frost, poison, wind, lightning. Breath weapons of every color painted the sky. The crowd gasped at the spectacle.\n\n\"Nyang!\"\n\nGrid summoned a cat.\n\nEvery face in the stadium twisted in confusion.\n\n---"
