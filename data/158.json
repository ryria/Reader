High protection, minimal offense. The discs barely scratched enemies unless he landed a critical hit. For the pet marathon, he needed something different. Something that could actually kill.\n\n*The durability is infinite. No matter how many pets attack it, they can't damage pavranium. I need a form built for offense.*\n\nThe problem was quantity. He only had enough pavranium to fill his palm—nowhere near enough for two daggers.\n\n*Something smaller.*\n\nGrid turned the egg-sized lump over in his hands. How could he maximize its efficiency? The answer came after several minutes of silent deliberation.\n\n*Needles.*\n\nThe ringing of steel filled the smithy. Grid's dexterity—higher than any user or NPC in Satisfy—allowed him to work the legendary metal with surgical precision. Thirty needles took shape beneath his hammer. Each one measured ten centimeters long, tapering to a wicked point.\n\n\"Oh...\"\n\nThe needles lifted from the anvil on their own. They orbited Grid in a perfect circle, golden light glinting off their tips as they rotated at regular intervals. Smith's jaw went slack.\n\nGrid allowed himself a small smile. \"Don't look so impressed yet.\"\n\nHe pointed at a heavy hammer resting against the wall.\n\n\"Throw that at me.\"\n\nSmith's face drained of color. \"Are you insane? You'll get hurt!\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it. Throw it as hard as you can.\"\n\n\"I can't—\"\n\n\"Do it.\"\n\nSmith swallowed hard. He hefted the hammer, closed his eyes, and hurled it with both hands. The moment it left his grip, the thirty needles reacted. They streaked through the air, forming a line before spreading into a miniature shield. The hammer struck the barrier with a dull *thud* and clattered to the floor.\n\nGrid pointed at the fallen tool. \"Pierce it.\"\n\nThe needles dove as one. Steel shrieked as thirty points of pavranium punched clean through the hammer's head, leaving it riddled with perfect circular holes.\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nGrid picked up the ruined hammer and examined his work. Then he checked the item window.\n\n---\n\n**[Golden Needles Made of Pavranium]**\n\nDurability: Infinite  \nAttack Power per Needle: 8\n\n*Penetration Effect*\n\nGolden needles forged from pavranium, the ultimate mineral created through collaboration between Legendary Blacksmith Pagma and Legendary Great Magician Braham.\n\nThough individually weak in attack power, their sharpness allows them to pierce materials with ease. However, they are vulnerable to magic-based defenses.\n\nStriking an enemy's weak point can inflict various status ailments and significantly increases critical hit rate.\n\nCan combine to form defensive barriers depending on the situation.\n\n**Blessings:**\n* **Goddess Rebecca**: Increases owner's health recovery speed by 300%.\n* **God Dominion**: Increases owner's attack power by 15%.\n* **God Judar**: Increases owner's defense by 15%.\n\nWeight: 5\n\n---\n\n*It's not exactly a traditional pet, but...*\n\nThe pavranium had its own will. It obeyed him absolutely. Shape didn't matter for the marathon—only obedience did.\n\nA whisper notification blinked in his peripheral vision.\n\n—*I've arrived at Bairan. Where should we meet?*\n\nYura's message. Grid glanced toward the eastern gate, where most of his guild members were still clearing rubble.\n\n—*West gate. I'll head there now.*\n\nHe set a meeting point far from his people. Just in case.\n\n\"Guess I need to make another hammer,\" Smith muttered behind him.\n\nGrid was already walking out the door.\n\n***\n\nTen minutes later, Grid stood at the western gate, scanning the crowd. Normal users streamed past him toward the hunting grounds, ignoring the destroyed buildings around them. None of them cared enough to help with repairs.\n\nNo sign of Yura.\n\n\"Here.\"\n\nHe turned toward the voice. A figure stood at the mouth of a nearby alley, draped head to toe in black robes. If not for that clear, unmistakable voice, he never would have recognized her.\n\nGrid walked over, his expression flat. \"This is excessive. A mask or hat would hide your face and ID. Why cover everything?\"\n\nYura's tone turned sheepish. \"People recognize me even with just my face covered.\"\n\n\"...They recognize your body.\"\n\nIt was true. Yura's proportions were damn near perfect—ideal measurements, a narrow waist, defined collarbone. Her more obsessive fans probably could identify her by silhouette alone.\n\n\"Show me the pet you mentioned,\" Yura said, cutting through the awkwardness.\n\nGrid nodded. The thirty needles emerged from his inventory, spinning in formation around him. Yura threw back her hood, her sharp eyes fixed on the rotating gold.\n\n\"It's exactly as you said. But...\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"Are you Pagma's Descendant?\"\n\n\"What?\" Grid blinked. \"What kind of nonsense is that? Why would I be—\"\n\n\"I saw Pagma's Descendant resist Neberius's magic during the battle. It reminded me of you. I wasn't certain until now, but...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Your golden needles and Pagma's discs are made of the same material. They move the same way. You don't have an epic hidden class.\"\n\nYura's voice dropped.\n\n\"You have a legendary class.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It's fine if you don't want to admit it.\" Yura waved a hand. \"Epic or legendary, it doesn't change the fact that South Korea needs you. Anyway, based on what I saw during the broadcast, those discs should qualify for the pet marathon—\"\n\n\"The connection between husband and wife truly is remarkable.\"\n\nBoth of them froze. A woman's voice echoed from deeper in the alley. Grid and Yura turned as one.\n\nSilver hair. Expensive clothes layered with jewelry. The unmistakable bearing of nobility.\n\n\"Irene?\"\n\nGrid's eyes widened. His mind raced.\n\n*I'm alone in an alley with another woman. She's going to think—*\n\nBut Irene's expression remained calm. The wedding ring on his finger caught her eye, and her affection stat didn't waver. She stepped forward and looped her arm through his without hesitation. Then she smiled at Yura.\n\n\"Are you my husband's friend? I don't believe we've met. I am Irene Winston von Steim—Lady of Winston and Grid's wife.\"\n\nYura went rigid.\n\n*Lady Winston married a user? And that user is Grid?*\n\nThe more she learned about him, the more layers he revealed.\n\n\"I—\"\n\n\"My Lady! Get back!\"\n\nPhoenix appeared behind Irene, sword already half-drawn. His eyes locked onto Yura. Recognition flashed across his face.\n\n\"That's Yatan's Eighth Servant!\"\n\nHe'd fought her before. Lost hundreds of men. Nearly died. This time, he'd make her pay. Phoenix ripped the Sword of Self-transcendence from its sheath, the legendary blade humming with power.\n\nIrene's breath hitched. \"The Eighth Servant...? But you said she was your friend?\"\n\nConfusion warred with fear on her face. Grid couldn't let this spiral. He pulled Irene close, shielding her with his body. Then he drew Dainsleif—not Failure, which would give him away—and leveled it at Yura.\n\n\"You wicked girl!\"\n\nGrid's voice rang through the alley like something out of a bad stage play.\n\n\"You hid your identity and approached me! I'll never let you near my wife!\"\n\nYura's eye twitched.\n\n*Wicked girl?*\n\nNo one had ever called her that in her entire life. But she was quick. She caught on immediately. Her expression shifted, lips curling into a cold sneer.\n\n\"My plan was to get close to you, then kill Lady Irene when you let your guard down. But that old knight ruined the timing. Pity. I'll have to try again another day.\"\n\nMagic circles flared beneath her feet. Yura shot into the sky like a javelin. Grid could have stopped her—the needles could reach that high—but he stayed rooted in place, one arm wrapped protectively around Irene. Phoenix and the knights charged after her, but their heavy armor slowed them in the narrow alley.\n\nYura vanished beyond the rooftops.\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nIrene's legs gave out. The Yatan Church had kidnapped her twice. The trauma still lived in her bones. Grid knelt in front of her, catching her weight. He cupped her face with one hand, his thumb brushing her cheek.\n\n\"It's okay. I'm here. You don't have to be afraid.\"\n\n\"Dear husband...\"\n\nGrid had changed since they'd first met. Healthier. Stronger. More confident. Irene's heart pounded as she looked up at him. For a moment, she felt like a princess in a fairy tale.\n\n***\n\nFrom that day forward, the recovery effort accelerated. With Irene's soldiers and craftsmen joining the work, Bairan Village rebuilt itself faster than anyone expected.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**  \nOG: Glossary Link.  \n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
