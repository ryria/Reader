  "content": "**CHAPTER: THE GATHERING STORM**\n\nWhen people thought of assassins in *Satisfy*, one name dominated the conversation. From children to elders, the answer was inevitable: the shadow who guarded the Overgeared Kingdom. Faker, the god of death. Despite wielding only a normal class, he'd earned his reputation through flawless execution and unmatched PK prowess. His legend grew with each passing day.\n\nYet ask about assassins *in the National Competition*, and the answer shifted.\n\nFaker had never graced the tournament stage beyond the Overgered Kingdom's founding ceremony. That left only one viable candidate: Tarma of Blood Carnival.\n\nThe dark gamer had stormed into the 2nd National Competition hungry for prize money, his skills undeniable—right up until Grid crushed him beneath an avalanche of overwhelming power.\n\n*I'll have my revenge.*\n\nAfter Blood Carnival's destruction at Grid's hands, Tarma had vanished into the East Continent's desert kingdoms. Three months of relentless grinding. Three months mastering sand and wind. Three months growing stronger than he'd ever imagined possible. Creatures that once pushed him to his limits now fell like wheat before the scythe.\n\nThe Grid who'd haunted his nightmares—that unstoppable juggernaut—no longer seemed so invincible.\n\n*With this power, even Grid will fall.*\n\nThe fox-masked swordsman lunged. Tarma's hand shot out, and the blade disintegrated into worthless sand. **Erosion**—his new racial special skill. Five seconds to decompose any object classified as a \"thing.\" Weapons, armor, items—all the equipment players relied on.\n\nThe perfect counter to Grid's item-dependent fighting style.\n\n*Five seconds. That's all I need.*\n\nTarma closed his eyes as the canyon monsters dissolved into experience. In his mind, the simulation ran again and again. Grid, but stronger. Grid with all his new legendary items. Grid at the height of his current power.\n\nVictory. Every time, victory.\n\nHe saw it clearly: Grid's face twisting in disbelief as his precious equipment crumbled to dust.\n\n\"Yes...\" A predatory smile cut across Tarma's angular features. Revenge. Recognition. Redemption. All within reach.\n\n*Now I need a sponsor.*\n\nWho stood to gain the most from Grid's downfall? The Belto Kingdom war flashed through his memory.\n\n*Agnus.*\n\nThe self-proclaimed \"King of Life and Death\" who commanded the Immortal Guild. He'd retreated before the combined might of Grid and Ares, but everyone knew the grudge festered. Grid represented a massive obstacle to whatever twisted ambitions drove that lunatic.\n\n*If I prevent Grid from winning even a single gold medal...*\n\nThe S.A. Group's special rewards for medalists made the proposal irresistible. Denying Grid those prizes would cripple the Overgeared King while elevating his enemies. A transaction too profitable to refuse.\n\nTarma made contact.\n\nThen he discovered why people called Agnus insane.\n\n\"You want *money* to kill Grid?\" The voice dripped with manic confusion. \"What the hell is this mad dog barking about? Huh~~?\"\n\n\"How is this difficult to understand? Imagine the advantage if Grid fails to medal.\"\n\n\"Kikikik? Grid is *my* target. You think you can beat him?\"\n\n\"What does beating Grid have to do with him being your target?\"\n\n\"I'll kill anyone who touches my prey.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nWas he insane? The conversation spiraled into incoherence, like arguing with an alien species. Tarma's tongue clicked in frustration.\n\n*He's faking. Doesn't want to pay. Cheap bastard.*\n\nNo—better to assume cunning rather than miserliness.\n\n*He knows I'll go after Grid regardless. No need to pay for something that'll happen anyway.*\n\nTarma's grudge was public knowledge. Of course Agnus understood the situation. The assassin nodded to himself.\n\n\"Then I'll find other clients.\"\n\n*Sururuk.*\n\nHe melted into the shadows. Agnus stared at the empty space where Tarma had stood.\n\n\"Who was that?\"\n\nVeradin's pleasant laugh echoed through the chamber. \"Don't remember the small fries? Though I'm not sure he qualifies as a small fry anymore...\"\n\nHis eyes gleamed with anticipation.\n\n*Tarma's fought Grid multiple times. He wouldn't be this confident without solid reasoning.*\n\nThe assassin might prove surprisingly useful.\n\n*This year's competition will be spectacular. Pity Agnus can't participate.*\n\nThe world had seen Agnus' face since the Belto Kingdom massacre, but rules and regulations meant nothing to someone who couldn't control his own impulses. Better to keep that particular powder keg away from structured events.\n\n***\n\n\"The sky will never fall.\"\n\nHao muttered the words like a prayer as he shadowed Kraugel through another hunting ground.\n\n\"Congratulations on level 260.\"\n\nAdmiration and disbelief warred in his voice. Kraugel's leveling efficiency transcended common sense—perfect movement, zero wasted time, optimal strategy for every environment. Monsters fell before him like autumn leaves.\n\nHao's own leveling speed had increased forty percent just from *watching*. Yet Kraugel saw only failure.\n\n\"Grid gained nearly ten levels in the last two weeks.\" His tone carried only mild disappointment. \"I'm falling behind.\"\n\n\"The Behen Archipelago clear rewards inflated his gains,\" Alexander countered. \"Plus he's focused exclusively on named boss raids now.\"\n\nTrue enough. Only named grade boss raids could explain Grid's explosive growth. The caveat? Named bosses weren't exactly common. Most players went months without encountering one.\n\n\"That's what makes it impressive.\" Kraugel's voice held genuine appreciation. \"How many players in the world can monopolize hunting grounds with named boss spawns?\"\n\nOf course, Kraugel monopolized plenty of named bosses himself—in locations ordinary players couldn't even *reach*. His problem was different: finding hunting grounds where named bosses appeared alongside *massive monster populations*. Places like the vampire cities that offered both elite enemies and boss encounters simultaneously.\n\nMost of Kraugel's named bosses guarded empty, desolate territories.\n\n*This gap might be permanent.*\n\nThe thought made him smile. Impatience felt... good. Fresh. Exciting. He'd spent years at the absolute peak, unchallenged. Now someone ran ahead of him, just out of reach.\n\n*Level 300 before the National Competition would be ideal. At current pace, I'll hit 272 in two months.*\n\nSomething in his expression must have shown.\n\n\"Are you going to participate in PvP?\" Hao's question came carefully, almost reluctantly.\n\nGrid and Kraugel were separated by eighty levels. Kraugel hadn't reached the third stat awakening threshold at level 300. Grid's statistics would be *overwhelmingly* superior. Should Kraugel really enter an event guaranteed to include the world's strongest rankers—including Grid himself?\n\nIt was unfair. A handicapped match.\n\nHao silently prayed his idol would decline this year. Watching Kraugel lose would be agony.\n\n\"I'll participate.\"\n\n\"*What?*\" Alexander's head whipped around. \"Are you a complete fool? Forget Grid—you could lose to Chris or Damian! Why destroy your reputation?\"\n\n\"I agree with Alexander.\" Hao's voice carried uncharacteristic urgency. \"I especially don't want you fighting Grid.\"\n\nHao respected Grid as deeply as he respected Kraugel. They were rivals, yes, but honorable ones. Fighting at such a disadvantage would be painful for both of them. For everyone watching.\n\n\"Your rematch should happen when you're *both* perfectly prepared,\" Hao insisted. \"When it can be memorable. Meaningful. Not like this.\"\n\nAlexander nodded emphatically.\n\nThen Kraugel's eyes changed.\n\nThe warmth bled away, replaced by something cold and distant—the expression from his solitary days, impossible to read.\n\n\"Are you assuming I'll lose?\"\n\nThe temperature seemed to drop.\n\n\"I'm determined to fight. And I believe I'll win.\"\n\nHao and Alexander forgot how to breathe. This was the **Sky Above the Sky** speaking. The man who'd claimed the legendary Sword Saint class. Concepts like \"level disadvantage\" were for ordinary players.\n\n\"Actually, this year gives me the *best* odds.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nBoth men stared, uncomprehending. Kraugel shrugged.\n\n\"How many times have you said it yourselves? Grid's potential is the strongest in *Satisfy*. He grows more dangerous every day. If I wait until our levels match...\" He shook his head. \"I might never win again.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nSome might call it ridiculous. But Kraugel's sincerity was absolute.\n\n*He's different from me. I have only swordsmanship.*\n\nGrid wielded swordsmanship, crafting, and magic in perfect synthesis. Without a second class to expand his own toolkit, Kraugel recognized Grid's potential as fundamentally greater.\n\nThe basis for that judgment? Grid's talent for growth.\n\n*His willpower will drive him beyond any ceiling.*\n\nKraugel remembered Grid's eyes during their first clash. During their second. The more desperate the situation, the brighter those eyes burned with determination.\n\n*Thump. Thump. Thump.*\n\nJust as Grid's heart raced when thinking of Kraugel, so too did Kraugel's pulse quicken at the thought of their next battle.\n\nThe anticipation was delicious."
