The big poisonous rats cook all types of food in this frying pan and use it as tableware at the same time. It is a frying pan made with coarse technology, but it's better than nothing.\n> \n> Conditions of Use: None.\n> \n> Weight: 70\n\nGrid stared at the item description.\n\n*I thought it was Idan's frying pan.*\n\nHe blinked.\n\n*But it's the hamster's.*\n\nHis mind went blank for several seconds. Then he shook his head violently.\n\n\"Where in the world is there a hamster that cooks with a frying pan?\"\n\nThe intelligence of the big poisonous rats was undeniable. He'd experienced it firsthand. Their language skills, their communal living—far superior to orcs or goblins. But creating tools required more than instinct. It required *concept*. Abstract thought.\n\n*They're still monsters. Survival comes first.*\n\nGrid could accept weapons. Predators needed tools to catch prey. That made sense. But cooking? Monsters ate raw meat. They didn't have *cuisine*.\n\n\"It's absurd. They have a desire for gourmet food?\"\n\n*Are they interested in cleanliness too?* Grid snorted. *They should've made a toothbrush along with the frying pan. That breath...*\n\nHe tossed the frying pan aside and stepped out of the tent.\n\n*Wait.*\n\nThe thought struck him mid-stride.\n\n*The hamsters got the idea from somewhere. Maybe... Idan's frying pan was abandoned here?*\n\nIt made sense. Primitive minds copying advanced designs.\n\n*They found Idan's frying pan. Got inspired. Made crude imitations.*\n\nGrid nodded to himself. Logic restored.\n\nThe tent fabric fluttered behind him, torn and scorched from battle. He moved deeper into the community with purposeful steps. The tents grew denser as he approached the center. Then he saw it.\n\nA massive structure. Ten times larger than the others.\n\n*The boss.*\n\n*Idan's frying pan has to be in there.*\n\nThe question was approach. Direct assault or methodical clearance?\n\n*I could charge straight through.*\n\nThe gaps between tents were wide. Smashing through obstacles wouldn't be difficult. But—\n\n*If I reach the boss with most of the community intact...*\n\nThe risk multiplied in his mind. A summoning skill. A rallying cry. Hundreds of hamsters converging at once.\n\n*Death.*\n\nGrid grimaced.\n\n*No. Clear from the edges inward. Slow and steady.*\n\nThe East Continent was empty. No other players to steal his kills. No competition for experience.\n\n\"There's no rush.\"\n\n*Like having a private server.*\n\nThe thought pleased him. Grid set to work, moving tent by tent from the outer ring toward the center. Each structure held sleeping hamsters. Each hamster died.\n\n---\n\n> [You have defeated a big poisonous rat.]\n>\n> [36,445,900 experience has been acquired.]\n>\n> [A big poisonous rat's gallbladder has been acquired.]\n>\n> [You have defeated a male big poi...]\n>\n> [Your level has risen!]\n>\n> [As someone with a second class, you will receive a level up bonus. 12 stat points have been acquired.]\n>\n> [Six points have been forcibly invested into intelligence due to the influence of the second class, Legendary Great Magician.]\n>\n> [Your intelligence is over 1,300.]\n>\n> [A new magic spell can now be learned!]\n\nHis second level since arriving. Hundreds of homes destroyed. Level 319. Intelligence surpassing 1,300.\n\nGrid should have felt triumphant.\n\nInstead, shame coiled in his gut.\n\n\"I'm... a home invader.\"\n\nThe big poisonous rats were *devoted*. Couples slept curled together in makeshift beds. Before death, their eyes met. Gentle. Loving.\n\n*Is this psychological torture?*\n\nA hunting system designed to inflict guilt. It left a foul taste in his mouth.\n\n*There's definitely a psychopath on the dev team.*\n\nBraham's voice cut through his brooding.\n\n*Rejoice! You shall experience my power—strength that separates me from the inferior masses of this world!*\n\nConfidence radiated from the ancient mage. His greatest pride was his magic. He wanted Grid to witness his true greatness.\n\nGrid's mood shifted instantly.\n\n*New magic!*\n\nSecond spell since acquiring the class. Beyond the default Magic Missile, he'd only learned Magic Detection. His intelligence had been too low. Despite possessing a *legendary* great magician class, he'd been stuck with two beginner spells.\n\n*Pathetic.*\n\nBut now—\n\n*Now I unlock legendary magic as my intelligence grows!*\n\nExcitement surged through him.\n\n\"Fireball! I can finally use Fireball!\"\n\nA notification appeared.\n\n---\n\n> [A new magic spell can now be learned.]\n>\n> **[Alarm (Enhanced) Lv. 1]**\n>\n> A spell developed by the legendary great magician who has completely overturned the activation formula.\n> \n> You can set all types of alarm sounds at the desired timing and location.\n> \n> As the level rises, the diversity of the sounds and the range will increase.\n> \n> Resource Consumption: 500 Mana.\n> \n> Skill Cooldown Time: 1 minute.\n> \n> *If you use this spell three times in Great Magician mode, you will learn it.*\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid's brain refused to process. Braham's laughter echoed in his skull.\n\n*Huhuhut. This alarm—*\n\n\"Quiet.\"\n\n*...?*\n\n\"Please. Be quiet.\"\n\n*I need to be alone.*\n\nAlarm was the most basic utility spell. Common knowledge. He'd never imagined it would require Magic Missile and Magic Detection as *prerequisites*.\n\n*It should be learned by default! Like Magic Missile!*\n\nWhat kind of garbage magic needed **1,300 intelligence** to unlock?\n\nGrid stood motionless. Expectations shattered. Frustration mounting. Killing intent began seeping into his vision. The rage needed an outlet.\n\n\"Kill.\"\n\nHis hand clenched around Sword Ghost. Knuckles white. He walked toward the nearest tent with deliberate steps.\n\nThe slaughter began.\n\nFierce. Stealthy. Merciless.\n\nHe didn't hesitate when facing the loving hamster couples. Couldn't afford to care about their circumstances.\n\nNot right now.\n\n---\n\n\"Hah... hah... I can breathe again.\"\n\nThe tent city sprawled before him. Burned. Torn. Collapsed. Half a day of systematic massacre. Only one structure remained intact.\n\nThe massive central tent.\n\n*The boss. And Idan's frying pan.*\n\nLevel 320 Grid activated Magic Detection. He needed to gauge the enemy. Estimate the threat.\n\n---\n\n> [Magic Detection (Enhanced) has been used.]\n>\n> [Magic Detection (Enhanced) has risen from Lv.2 to Lv.3!]\n>\n> [The power of Magic Detection (Enhanced) has increased! Magic Detection can now identify the target's stats!]\n\n---\n\n> **Name:** Strong Male Rat\n> \n> **Level:** ???\n> \n> **Class:** ???\n> \n> **Stats:** ???\n> \n> **Species:** Big Poisonous Rat\n> \n> **Status:** Monster\n\n---\n\n> **Name:** Queen Rat\n> \n> **Level:** ???\n> \n> **Class:** ???\n> \n> **Stats:** ???\n> \n> **Species:** Big Poisonous Rat\n> \n> **Status:** Monster\n\n\"Two of them...\"\n\nThe boss didn't even keep a harem. Monogamous.\n\n\"Principled hamsters!\"\n\nThe skill level increase had sparked hope. Now question marks mocked him. Magic Detection felt like a betrayal.\n\n*My Magic Detection is great magic. The only deficiency is your intelligence.*\n\n\"Right! My fault! I'm the problem! Alarm magic exists because I'm inadequate! Wonderful!\"\n\n*Why would a legendary magician even use Alarm?*\n\nHis frustration with Braham boiled over. Grid's voice rose—loud enough to carry into the tent.\n\n\"Muong? A human? Here?\"\n\n\"You disturbed our nap time. You'll pay for that. Muong.\"\n\nThe queen emerged. A crude crown sat between her ears. A red cloak draped her body. She was *massive*—twice Grid's size. White chest fur gleamed as she extended a paw from beneath the cloak.\n\nPointed at Grid.\n\n\"Muong. Humans are nasty. No fur. Disgusting. I'll kill you immediately. Muong.\"\n\nShe wielded a trident.\n\nThe weapon shot forward—aimed to skewer.\n\nGrid threw himself sideways as Braham spoke.\n\n*Leave this to me. I'll demonstrate how to use Alarm properly.*\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Alarm? In combat?*\n\nIt seemed absurd. But Grid couldn't dismiss Braham entirely.\n\n*Magic from a legendary great magician. Even utility spells might have hidden applications.*\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nWhite hair cascaded down Grid's shoulders as his body surrendered control."
