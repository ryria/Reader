  "content": "---\n\n*Before Pagma walked this earth, there lived a blacksmith named Bultar.*\n\nThe voice was cold, almost clinical in its detachment. Grid still couldn't identify its owner—was it Taren, the Fourth Evil whose power fueled God's Command? In the end, it didn't matter.\n\n*He was no legend. Just an ordinary man who never stopped working. For those who needed him, he lived at his forge, his skin perpetually flushed from the heat.*\n\nDarkness swallowed Grid's vision. When it receded, the Vatican's warehouse had vanished, replaced by a cramped, soot-stained smithy.\n\n*Tang! Tang! Tang!*\n\nA lone blacksmith hammered crude tools with desperate intensity. Sweat poured down his reddened skin as the furnace blazed behind him. Bultar. Despite obvious exhaustion, his hammer never stopped rising and falling.\n\n*Why push himself so hard?*\n\nThe answer came immediately.\n\n\"Bultar! Where are those tools?\"\n\n\"Almost finished!\" \n\nHow many days without sleep? Bultar swayed on his feet, nearly pitching forward into the furnace before the shout jolted him awake. Through the smithy's open door, Grid could see rain hammering down on a small village. The levee had broken. Floodwaters surged through the streets while villagers fought desperately to save their homes. And Bultar—the village's only blacksmith—worked himself to the bone forging the tools they needed to survive.\n\n\"Twenty more shovels, Bultar!\"\n\n\"Hurry!\"\n\nBultar said nothing. Even legends had limits, and Grid knew firsthand that another sleepless night would break most people. Yet Bultar endured. Four days straight, hammering without rest. What struck Grid most was that Bultar never complained, never let the villagers see his struggle. He understood what they needed—not just tools, but confidence. If he admitted weakness, their anxiety would spiral.\n\nSo he worked in silence. Persevered to the bitter end. This was the moment when his will transcended flesh.\n\nWhen the village was finally saved, a voice reached him.\n\n*Rebecca herself called to him.*\n\nThe Goddess of Light praised his sacrifice, his ability to surpass mortal limitations for others. She promised him strength to match his dedication. The blacksmith god Hexetia blessed Bultar personally, transforming him into a master craftsman—one of the legendary Seven Selected.\n\n*Afterward, Bultar never stopped striving. He burned with gratitude toward Rebecca and Hexetia, determined to become the greatest blacksmith who ever lived. No one expected that passion would become poison.*\n\nThrough relentless effort, Bultar achieved Creation—the power to forge entirely new materials and tools. He created minerals that had never existed, crafted implements that revolutionized human life.\n\nAnd Hexetia grew jealous.\n\n*When a mere human's achievements began rivaling a god's, Hexetia's envy consumed him. He rained minerals from the sky like meteorites. Lava boiled up through the earth. Humanity burned.*\n\nAs people died screaming around him, Bultar's final creation was the Stone of Original Sin.\n\n*The First Holy Sword represented Hexetia's greatest gift to humanity—the reason humans would never forget him. Bultar rejected that legacy. He sealed the blade with the very sin Hexetia had committed: envy. He erased the evidence of Hexetia's benevolence, turning triumph into curse.*\n\n*The other Selected followed Bultar's lead. All blessed by gods, all fighting to save humanity from their divine benefactors. Thus were born the Seven Malignant Saints—branded as villains by the very gods who created them.*\n\n*In the end, we failed. The gods told the world we threatened existence itself. We fought for humanity, yet became the monsters in their stories.*\n\nThe voice carried no bitterness now, no rage. Only sardonic acceptance—grudges refined by centuries or perhaps millennia into something colder than hate.\n\n*They sealed us between the surface and Hell. From that prison, we watched and waited. We hoped the next generation would see through the gods' blinding light.*\n\n*But history repeated. Hexetia grew jealous of Pagma and threatened humanity again. The other gods either ignored it or assisted. That's when we understood—humanity's survival was never more than a whim. This world exists for their amusement.*\n\nDespair had nearly broken the Seven Malignant Saints then. They believed humanity would fall without their protection, that the human race would simply cease to exist.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nThe war against the Seven had exhausted the gods, left them weakened and desperate. They were forced to bargain with Hell itself. The First Great Demon, Baal, accepted their plea and stood beside Pagma. The gods became entertainment for the demon.\n\nHumanity survived. Two hundred years passed.\n\n*And now this era has come.*\n\nThe current generation was weaker than those before. The Seven Malignant Saints had faded to shadows. The legends were pale imitations of their predecessors. Pagma's Descendant earned the title Hero King instead of Sword Saint. No one had inherited the Undefeated King's legacy.\n\nIf Hexetia's envy flared again now, humanity would crumble. The Seven had made their decision—they would sacrifice what remained of their power to bolster this generation's inexperienced heroes. They would fade from existence, but perhaps humanity would endure.\n\nBut then—\n\n*You changed everything.*\n\nGrid had removed envy itself. Reformed Hexetia. The Seven Malignant Saints could scarcely believe it. This Hero King who seemed so inadequate compared to legends past had accomplished what they never imagined possible.\n\n*The remaining six sins are delayed. For now, humanity walks a path toward peace.*\n\nOf course, \"peace\" was a relative term.\n\n*Humans commit more sins daily than the gods manage in centuries. Their wars will continue—but that's beyond our concern.*\n\nThe voice was fading. As it dwindled, Grid called out, \"Who are you?\"\n\n*I am the greatest sin of all.*\n\nA pause, heavy with weight.\n\n*The Seventh Evil. Corruption.*\n\nDarkness detonated outward. Grid's consciousness scattered like smoke.\n\n\"...Grid!\"\n\nWhen his eyes opened, Damian and several Rebecca Church Elders were supporting him. His spirit had traveled far during that quest; now it snapped back to reality with jarring force.\n\n\"Ah...\" Grid realized he was gripping something—the First Holy Sword, whole and perfect in his hands.\n\n\"The curse is broken!\"\n\n\"Truly magnificent! King Grid, your devotion to Goddess Rebecca never wavers!\" The eldest laughed, nearly weeping with joy. \"We are blessed to witness such faith!\"\n\nThe Elders trembled with excitement, already convinced Grid had cleansed the blade despite not witnessing the act. Their trust was absolute—several had essentially deified him already.\n\nGrid shifted uncomfortably under their worshipful stares. He passed the sword to Damian, who looked both anxious and awed. \"The curse won't return. Rebecca's symbol will endure.\"\n\nDamian accepted the blade, opening his mouth to speak before stopping. Several times he started and stopped. Finally: \"Did you enjoy the adventure?\"\n\nHe'd seen the world message like everyone else. Part of him wanted to thank Grid, to apologize for the suffering the Rebecca Church kept causing him. But he swallowed those words. Grid's face held no shadows, no exhaustion—only the distant, satisfied smile of someone who'd glimpsed something profound. To pity him now would be insulting.\n\n\"Yeah.\" Grid's grin widened. \"It was incredible.\"\n\nHe'd witnessed a god's transformation. Changed the world's fate. The mythic scope of it all filled him with savage pride—the genuine feeling of being destiny's protagonist.\n\n[Quest Complete!]\n\n[In completing *Cleanse the Holy Sword*, you have unlocked a new Pagma episode and acquired new swordsmanship techniques. You have received the Goddess' blessing as additional compensation.]\n\n[You have heard Goddess Rebecca's warm voice.]\n\n*—Bless you.*\n\nGrid now possessed two divine blessings from Rebecca. But rather than joy, unease crept through him.\n\n*What is Rebecca's sin?*\n\nShe was the supreme deity, supposedly aware of everything in creation. Yet she showed no wariness toward Grid interfering with the Seven Malignant Saints, no concern that he'd prevented Hexetia's envy. She acted as though the Seven's existence was irrelevant to her. Meanwhile, the Seven themselves clearly feared her. Braham had called her wicked.\n\nAn unknown enemy was the most dangerous kind. Grid's wariness sharpened—though not enough to reject her blessing. He'd earned this reward through blood and sweat. He'd use it thoroughly.\n\n\"Oh, before we go—\" Grid caught Damian's shoulder as they headed toward the warehouse exit. \"Want to spar?\"\n\n\"What?\" Damian blinked. \"I mean... my attacks won't even scratch you, and one of yours could kill me instantly. The pressure of trying to hit you while dodging is intense, and your God Hands make it nearly impossible to—\"\n\n\"Right.\" Grid cut him off. He'd been agonizing over the sword he'd forged in Asgard—the Blade Aiming at the Gods. The God Hands were a trump card designed to cover his weaknesses. Was locking pavranium into sword form really the optimal choice?\n\n*The bonus God Hand summon during attacks won't last forever. Physical attack power is higher, but magic damage doesn't improve and area damage is far below the Enlightenment Sword. Contempt of the Weak doesn't affect transcendents—useless against anyone who matters.*\n\nHe needed to test the lightning and golden cloud effects. Needed data.\n\nGrid tightened his grip on Damian's shoulder, smiling warmly. \"How long has it been since we sparred?\"\n\n\"...Huh?\" Damian's face went pale as he remembered their last bout—when Grid had tested the Enlightenment Sword. \"Please, anything but that!\"\n\n\"What if I ask Isabel instead?\"\n\nDamian's expression hardened with grim determination. \"...I'll do it.\"\n\nNo man worth his salt would let the woman he loved become a punching bag. Weeping internally, the Pope accepted his fate.\n\nThe Vatican's garden became their arena. Players from the Rebecca Church gathered as word spread. They knew Damian's strength had grown exponentially since the Third National Competition—knew he was now among the world's elite. This wouldn't be a one-sided slaughter. Grid might be Grid, but Damian had closed the gap considerably.\n\nThe gathered crowd buzzed with anticipation. Who would emerge victorious?"
