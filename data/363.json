Grid dragged Sticks into the shade and dropped him against a trunk.\n\n\"Talk.\" Grid crouched over him. \"You want to live? Give me the elf's recipe.\"\n\n\"Ugh...\" Sticks wheezed, sweat soaking through his robes. His chest hitched with each breath.\n\nGrid yanked potions from his inventory and forced them down the elf's throat. Red. Blue. Green. Nothing worked. The elf's condition only worsened.\n\n\"Challenger!\" Bini fluttered in panicked circles around Grid's head. \"Please! You must save Sticks!\"\n\n*What the hell do I do?*\n\nA month ago, Grid would've frozen. Panicked. But Kraugel had beaten that weakness out of him. The Behen Archipelago had sharpened the rest.\n\nGrid stood and pulled a sword from his inventory.\n\n> [Great Lord's Sword]\n\nThe weapon gleamed in his hand. A <span class=\"rarity-rare\">Rare</span> blade granted only to dukes, designed to peel back the secrets of subordinates. The **Character Observation** skill hummed to life.\n\n*Give me something, old man.*\n\nThe system answered.\n\n> [Character Observation has been used.]\n\n---\n\n**Name:** Sticks  \n**Age:** 881 | **Gender:** Male  \n**Race:** Elf | **Occupation:** Sage  \n**Title:** Wise Star\n\n*Benevolent and wise. Possesses extensive knowledge.*  \n*Isolated from the world for centuries. Knowledge is outdated.*\n\n**Level:** 401\n\n**Strength:** 403 **(▼)** | **Stamina:** 880 **(▼)**  \n**Agility:** 1,201 **(▼)** | **Intelligence:** 1,930 **(▼)**  \n**Wisdom:** 2,876 **(▼)** | **Charm:** 2,490\n\n**Skills:** Archery (B), Social Sciences (B▼), Engineering (B▼), Medicine (B▼), Humanities (B▼), Art (S), Magic Studies (S), Natural Sciences (S▼), Elementary Science (S+), Learning (SS), Education (SS).\n\n*A high elf of noble lineage.*\n\n*Lifespan should approach immortality. However, while protecting the world tree, he incurred the wrath of the Gourmet Dragon Reiders and contracted a disease.*\n\n***Currently suffering rapid stat degradation.***\n\n---\n\nGrid read the description twice. *World tree. Elf Forest. Then why the hell is he here?*\n\nHe turned to Bini. \"Why did Sticks come to the Behen Archipelago? The disease?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" The fairy bobbed. \"He came to cure it!\"\n\n\"There's medicine here?\"\n\n\"I don't know! I only saw him eating blue coconuts. Wait...\" Bini's eyes widened. \"Ah!\"\n\nGrid's gaze snapped to the palm trees. Blue coconuts hung in clusters overhead.\n\nHe gestured. The God Hands shot upward, tore the fruit from the branches, and ferried them down. Grid cracked one open and shoved it toward Sticks.\n\n\"This work?\"\n\nSticks' unfocused eyes locked onto the coconut. His lips moved. \"That... with... world tree leaves...\"\n\n\"Mix them?\"\n\nA weak nod.\n\nGrid split the coconut shell with his dagger. \"What are world tree leaves?\"\n\n\"I'll find them!\" Bini dove into Sticks' robes, rummaging through hidden pockets. Moments later, the fairy emerged with a handful of green foliage.\n\n> [Leaves of the World Tree (6) have been acquired.]\n\nGrid inspected them.\n\n---\n\n**[Leaves of the World Tree]**\n\nLeaves shed periodically by the world tree. Do not wither even after centuries.\n\n**Weight:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n\"How many?\"\n\nSticks raised one trembling finger.\n\nGrid dropped a single leaf into the coconut. The transparent liquid inside shimmered, then shifted to brilliant emerald.\n\n> [You have succeeded in preparing the 'Elf Miraculous Medicine'!]  \n> [Recipe: Elf Miraculous Medicine has been acquired!]\n\nGrid blinked at the notification.\n\n---\n\n**[Elf Miraculous Medicine]**\n\nImmediately recovers from all abnormal states.\n\nExceptionally powerful. The recipe is extremely simple. Anyone can make it.\n\n---\n\n*Immediately recovers from all abnormal states?*\n\nGrid's mind raced. *If we'd had this during the Elfin Stone raid...*\n\nHe shook his head. *Focus. Blue coconuts. World tree leaves. Where the hell do I get more?*\n\nSticks snatched the coconut and drank like a man crawling through a desert. The emerald liquid vanished in desperate gulps.\n\n> [First aid for Sticks is successful!]  \n> [An elf never forgets a debt. Sticks views you as a savior and will show great affection in the future!]\n\nColor flooded back into Sticks' face. His breathing steadied. He rose to his feet and bowed low.\n\n\"Thank you.\" The elf's voice was steady now. \"You saved my life. I am Sticks, high elf. May I know my benefactor's name?\"\n\nThe elf was stunning. Androgynous beauty that rivaled Yura and Jishuka, with golden eyes that caught the light like gemstones.\n\n\"Grid.\"\n\n\"Are you Pagma's Descendant?\"\n\nGrid stiffened. \"How did you know?\"\n\nSticks produced a translucent orb from his robes. \"I observed you through this. Swordsmanship beyond mortal limits. Mastery of countless artifacts. Blacksmithing talent.\" He smiled faintly. \"Only one name fits. Pagma.\"\n\nGrid nodded slowly. \"What is the Contaminated Hall of Fame?\"\n\n\"The Behen Archipelago's true name.\" Sticks' golden eyes gleamed. \"Originally called the Hall of Fame. A sacred place built to honor the feats of legends.\"\n\n\"Hall of Fame?\"\n\n\"A sanctuary of succession.\" Sticks studied Grid with renewed intensity. \"Where power left by former legends is inherited by current legends. That you arrived here is fate.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n> [A legendary class quest 'Hall of Fame' has been created.]  \n> [The legendary class quest 'Hall of Fame' has changed to '★Hidden Quest★ Contaminated Hall of Fame.']\n\nGrid stared at the system window.\n\n---\n\n## **[Scene Break]**\n\nThe Overgeared members were evolving.\n\nFormer Tzedakah elites. Yura. Huroi. Peak Sword. Two months of vampire city grinding had launched them up the rankings. Every day, the leaderboards shifted.\n\nThe vampire rings made the difference. Unlike Grid, who'd relied on Doran's Ring and the Holy Light Armor from the start, most players desperately needed recovery items. The <span class=\"rarity-epic\">Junior Vampire's Rings</span> changed everything.\n\n\"Next city.\" Jishuka stretched, her bow slung over one shoulder. \"The 10th is boring now.\"\n\nTwo months ago, Grid had encountered Braham's soul in the 10th city. Now? The Overgeared members yawned through it. No challenge. No growth.\n\n\"The boss said not to push too far.\" Huroi frowned. \"Marie Rose is out there.\"\n\n\"What if it's not Marie Rose?\" Peak Sword added. \"What if it's another Elfin Stone? Grid won't be here to carry us.\"\n\nYura and the Tzedakah veterans exchanged glances.\n\n\"Meeting strong enemies is experience.\" Yura checked her gun. \"Growth requires risk.\"\n\n\"Death is temporary.\" Pon spun his spear. \"Stagnation is permanent. Adventure is the foundation of progress.\"\n\n\"We can handle an Elfin Stone-level threat.\" Regas cracked his knuckles. \"We're stronger now.\"\n\nThe group had changed. Watching Grid demolish Kraugel had shattered something inside them. They'd worshipped Kraugel as the unreachable sky. Grid breaking him proved limits were illusions.\n\n*Why set boundaries? Why fear failure?*\n\n\"Time for a new challenge.\" Jishuka grinned.\n\n\"If we meet something worse than Elfin Stone, don't panic.\" Yura's eyes gleamed red. \"I'm here.\"\n\nHuroi and Peak Sword exchanged looks. There was no arguing with this momentum.\n\nThat day, the vampire expedition led by Yura and Jishuka entered the 9th city.\n\n---\n\n## **[Scene Break]**\n\nNinety-seven years.\n\nSticks had spent ninety-seven years in the Behen Archipelago, harvesting blue coconuts to slow his disease. At first, he'd marveled at the islands. Monuments to legends. Sanctuaries thrumming with ancient power.\n\nThen someone corrupted it. Trials. Traps. Barriers.\n\n*Legends must inherit the strength of those who came before. But now the path is poisoned. Someone must cleanse this place.*\n\nHe'd waited for a hero. Someone strong enough to hear the truth and fight alongside him.\n\nSticks had waited. And dreamed.\n\n---\n\n> [You have entered the 29th island.]  \n> [This is a save point. Do you want to save your position?]  \n> [You have been registered. When you enter the Behen Archipelago again, you will start from the 29th island.]\n\nGrid barely listened to Sticks' story as they moved forward. The old elf talked too much. But Grid nodded along, smiling at the right moments.\n\n*Learning skill. Education skill. Both SS-rank.*\n\nIf Sticks taught the talents in Reidan... if he tutored Lord...\n\n*I need this elf.*\n\n\"I'll make sure your efforts weren't wasted.\" Grid clapped Sticks on the shoulder. \"Trust me.\"\n\n*Show confidence. Make him want to follow me.*\n\nGrid stepped through the gate to the 30th island.\n\n> [You have entered the 30th island.]  \n> [Your level has dropped to Level 1.]\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nGrid's eyes bulged.\n\n\"This is why I couldn't advance.\" Sticks sighed. \"A curse. I cannot draw out my full strength here.\"\n\nGrid's jaw tightened.\n\n*Level 1.*\n\nThe notification mocked him.\n\n---\n\n**TL Note:** Yes, \"Gourmet Dragon\" is strange. I triple-checked with other translators. Apparently it's a dragon obsessed with food.
