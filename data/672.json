  "content": "\"Irene!\"\n\n\"King Grid!\"\n\nTheir laughter rang through the palace corridors—his booming and hers light as bells. \n\nGrid could scarcely believe it. Meteor. One billion attack power. Instant activation with no conditions. Not merely theoretical perfection but tangible reality, forged by his own hands. Three years into Satisfy, and he'd finally done it—created an item that defied logic itself.\n\nAnd now, holding Irene again, his joy overflowed.\n\n\"You've grown even more beautiful.\" He stroked her soft hair, brushing it back to reveal her delicate forehead. Without a thought for the knights and maids standing nearby, he leaned down and kissed that lovely expanse of skin.\n\nIrene's pale cheeks flushed crimson. \"I've missed you. Missed this...\"\n\nBut beneath her smile, worry gnawed at her heart. Yura. Jishuka. Euphemina. Laella. Beautiful women constantly surrounded her husband. And recently, that woman Sua had appeared. The writing on the wall was clear—Grid would take concubines eventually. He had every right as king.\n\nNot yet, though. Not because Grid only loved her. No, Irene understood that much. He was simply too busy.\n\n*Someday.*\n\nThe thought stabbed through her. Grid's warmth, his breath, his touch—all of it shared with others. She knew she couldn't monopolize him. A noble needed many children. For the kingdom's future, Grid needed many heirs.\n\nAnd there was something else. Something worse.\n\nGrid was blessed by the gods. He transcended time's flow. Five years of marriage had brought Irene into her mid-twenties, but Grid... Grid looked exactly the same. They matched now, but in another ten years? Twenty?\n\n*I don't belong with him.*\n\nThe women who truly matched Grid were Yura and Jishuka. The bitter reality brought tears to Irene's eyes.\n\n\"Irene?\" Grid's smile vanished. \"What's wrong? Did I—\"\n\n\"No!\" She wiped hastily at her eyes. \"I'm just... I'm so happy. So grateful for this moment with you.\"\n\nGrid had never been perceptive about others' feelings. He'd completely missed Yura's and Jishuka's affections. But he wasn't a complete fool. Not with Irene, the woman he'd shared his heart and life with. He understood.\n\n*Irene. Khan. Lord.*\n\nFinite lives. Natural and inevitable. Satisfy's time flowed faster than reality. Someday, the people he treasured would disappear. The thought sat heavy in his chest, but he pushed it down. Irene had given him so much happiness—he would repay her with the same.\n\n\"Irene.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty—\"\n\nHe pulled her close and kissed her deeply. The knights and maidens turned away, faces burning, as the two monarchs forgot the world around them.\n\n[**Overgeared King Grid and Queen Irene's love has set an example for the people.**]\n\n[**The marriage and birth rates in the Overgeared Kingdom have increased by 20%.**]\n\n[**The population growth rate of the Overgeared Kingdom has increased.**]\n\n---\n\n\"Huh? Isn't this a jackpot?\" \n\nBack in his office, Lauel's eyes gleamed at the notification.\n\nMeanwhile, in the training grounds, Vantner stared at his own empty notification window.\n\n\"...Dammit.\" Tears rolled down his bald head. Forever alone. \n\nPon laughed until he couldn't breathe.\n\n---\n\n\"Incredible.\"\n\nPiaro stood in the training grounds, studying the scarred earth with something approaching awe. He'd trained Damian personally in the fields—he knew the Pope's capabilities intimately.\n\n\"The temporary farmer...\" He caught himself. \"His Majesty has grown strong enough to drive back His Holiness?\"\n\nAsmophel nodded. \"In two or three years, he'll surpass me entirely.\"\n\nPiaro exhaled slowly. Asmophel never exaggerated. If he said it, it was truth. \n\nThe old swordsman remembered their first meeting—that dull youth who could barely control his own abilities. And now? Overwhelming a genius like Damian through sheer progression.\n\nThis was the power of effort. The inevitability of time.\n\nA dark smile creased Piaro's weathered face. Grid and Kraugel. The new generation's era was dawning. Even the Saharan Empire's current stranglehold on the Overgeared Kingdom wouldn't last forever.\n\nBut there was a problem.\n\nThat man. Baal's Contractor. A sinister shadow falling across this new era. He would interfere with Grid's path—Piaro felt it in his bones.\n\n*My role is to stop him.*\n\nThe vow settled in his heart, earnest and absolute.\n\n---\n\nValhalla burned hot in players' imaginations. \n\nGod of War Ares had founded a kingdom with systematic military organization—a clear path to power for those willing to earn it. Where Overgeared offered legendary equipment, Valhalla offered legendary structure. Players had choices now, and the Saharan Empire's population drained accordingly.\n\nNot catastrophic yet. But in the long run? Definite losses.\n\nThe imperial court was not pleased.\n\n\"The Overgeared Kingdom *still* hasn't collapsed?\" \n\nTitan's palace halls echoed with frustration. The gathered leaders demanded immediate action—punish both upstart kingdoms, crush them before they grew stronger. But reality imposed constraints.\n\nDecades of anti-immigrant policy had created constant internal conflict. Soldiers and citizens alike were exhausted. The empire couldn't mount large-scale operations against both Overgeared and Valhalla simultaneously. They'd been counting on the Overgeared Kingdom destroying itself through those crushing tribute demands.\n\nAnd yet...\n\n\"How are they still producing weapons and feeding their people with no money?\"\n\n\"Perhaps they're hiding funds? Falsifying the tax reports?\"\n\n\"Impossible. We're monitoring everything.\"\n\n\"Then explain how this is sustainable. Do they have infinitely proliferating minerals? Self-replicating food?\" Bitter laughter. \"It's absurd.\"\n\n\"Another kingdom must be aiding them. We should blockade all diplomatic channels.\"\n\n\"On what grounds? That risks open war.\"\n\n\"Valhalla is the real problem. The Overgeared King helped establish it. Isolate Overgeared from Valhalla and both crumble.\"\n\n\"Why not invade both simultaneously?\"\n\n\"With what army? The immigrant conflicts tie up our forces. Large-scale military action is impossible.\"\n\n\"The tribal wars continue. Famine spreads in the border regions. We can't extract war funds from tributaries—we'd have to bleed our own citizens. Internal revolt would follow.\"\n\n\"Ambassadors begging the great Saharan Empire for poverty relief... All because of those persistent scum.\"\n\n\"Eliminate the immigrants first. Then deal with Overgeared and Valhalla.\"\n\nThe confusion stemmed from one baffling reality: the Overgeared Kingdom should have starved within months. \n\nWhy hadn't it?\n\n---\n\n\"Another excellent harvest this quarter. Congratulations, Your Majesty.\"\n\nGrid shook his head. \"This is all Piaro's doing.\"\n\nThe Overgeared Kingdom's agriculture defied logic. Spring, summer, autumn, winter—every season yielded abundance. Piaro's legendary farmer passive skill made it possible. The man himself was fraudulent.\n\n\"Despite the empire seizing most of our wealth, nobody starves. Not citizens, not soldiers. I'm grateful for that much.\"\n\nRabbit's expression darkened. \"It's a thin veneer of stability, Sire. Beneath the surface, we're in danger. No funds for development. No investment in infrastructure. Stagnation leads to decay. Eventually, we'll wither.\"\n\n\"We need to break free of the empire's tribute system.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Rabbit nodded but offered no solutions. Valhalla's existence might deter immediate invasion, but declaring independence? That would bring the empire's full wrath down on them. They couldn't survive it.\n\nGrid frowned, lost in thought.\n\n—Overgeared King, what are you up to?\n\nA whisper interrupted—Ares.\n\n—What happened?\n\nThey might become enemies someday, but for now, Ares was Grid's most reliable ally.\n\n—The empire sent an envoy. Demanded tribute as a token of loyalty.\n\n—So Valhalla too...\n\nGrid assumed Ares had accepted, as any reasonable person would.\n\n—I told him to fuck off.\n\n—What?\n\n—Why would I pledge loyalty to bastards who sent Agnus to sabotage me? Grid's hand tightened. Ares' voice carried savage glee. —Those damn scum. I'll pop them like popcorn and wash them down with Coke.\n\n—You're inviting an invasion.\n\n—Not immediately. They're wary of the Overgeared Kingdom. Once they finish with the immigrant tribes, *then* they'll move on Valhalla.\n\n—What will you do?\n\n—Simple. You're going to help me out.\n\n—Reinforcements?\n\n—Items. Arm my soldiers with your equipment. I'll pay fair prices, naturally. Consider it an investment in our alliance.\n\nAres believed the most powerful army equipped with the strongest gear could repel the empire. But Grid hesitated. An overgeared Ares Army posed its own risks. What if they turned hostile?\n\n—For the record, I genuinely like you. Don't want to be enemies.\n\n—Right. Because you're an uncle.\n\n—Huh?\n\n—Nothing. Let me discuss this with Lauel.\n\n*Why am I only loved by men?*\n\nGrid closed the whisper, genuinely concerned, and found Lauel.\n\n\"Yesterday, I would've refused,\" Lauel said immediately. \"But now?\"\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"Accept his proposal. Sell the items. Make money.\"\n\n\"And if he betrays us?\"\n\nLauel's grin turned predatory. \"Then you use the Spark of Darkness sealed in the burning blade. Keke... kekekeke!\"\n\nGrid blinked.\n\nLauel leaned back, satisfaction radiating from every pore. \"Your power is national-level now, Your Majesty. Leave the Valhalla trade to me. You focus on conquering the Behen Archipelago.\""
