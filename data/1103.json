But cities like Reidan? They already had everything, which meant every policy angered someone.\n\nZednos understood this intellectually. Understanding didn't make it easier.\n\n\"Another petition.\" He stared at the stack of documents littering his desk. \"These merchants won't stop until they bankrupt the treasury.\"\n\nThe nobles surrounding him exchanged uncomfortable glances.\n\n\"No policy satisfies everyone, my lord,\" one ventured. \"Even if the majority prospers, the minority suffers.\"\n\n\"Chris managed it.\" Zednos rubbed his temples. \"He maintained perfect public sentiment while holding his ranking.\"\n\n\"Lord Chris had helpers. His old Giant Guild connections—\"\n\n\"He was a monster.\" Zednos cut him off with a bitter laugh. \"A real monster. And I'm realizing I'm not.\"\n\nThe admission hung in the air.\n\nHe'd become Chris's successor when Reidan was named the Overgeared Kingdom's second capital. The honor had thrilled him then. Now? Now he understood the weight Chris had carried—maintaining a top ranking while administering a major city, never letting either responsibility slip.\n\n*And Grid made even Chris look ordinary.*\n\nThe gap between them widened every day. If Chris wanted to keep pace with Grid, he'd have to abandon everything else—the kingdom, his duties, all of it.\n\n*I never appreciated what we had when they were here.*\n\nThe absence of the Ten Meritorious Retainers hollowed out the kingdom's infrastructure. Dozens of administrators couldn't fill the void they'd left behind.\n\nAt least foreign threats hadn't materialized. The Saharan Empire's shadow kept predators at bay. Even the elves—who'd claimed forests across the continent—cowered in their World Tree sanctuary after the Empire flexed its muscles.\n\n\"I need air.\" Zednos abandoned the nobles mid-discussion and escaped to the streets.\n\nFood had become his sole pleasure. Reidan's street vendors offered culinary delights that made the administrative headaches bearable, and Satisfy's perfect simulation meant he could indulge without consequence.\n\n\"One Noe Bread.\" He approached his favorite stall, already salivating.\n\nThe baker handed over the kingdom's unofficial mascot—a cat-shaped pastry with crispy exterior and soft corn filling. Zednos bit into the front paw.\n\nThen he froze.\n\nA woman approached through the crowd. Her face lay hidden beneath a turban that revealed only eyes and the bridge of her nose. That should have made her ordinary, forgettable.\n\nInstead, Zednos couldn't breathe.\n\nThose eyes held entire galaxies—red depths that made Yura, Jishuka, Irene, Sua, and Mercedes seem plain by comparison. His heart hammered against his ribs as if he'd sprinted a marathon.\n\n\"You are the strongest human in this city.\" Her voice was smoke and honey.\n\n\"Ah...\" Heat flooded his face.\n\n\"Are you in charge due to your strength?\" Amusement colored her tone. \"Good. Use your authority—I require a carriage with curtains to block the sun. Then escort me to the nearest forest.\"\n\n\"...I understand.\" The words left his mouth before conscious thought formed.\n\n*Why was he agreeing? He had responsibilities, duties—*\n\nNone of it mattered. He'd been born for this moment, to serve this woman. Everything else faded to insignificance.\n\nZednos didn't realize he'd returned to the castle with her until someone shouted.\n\n\"Virtuous Light!\"\n\nPure radiance enveloped him. The fog choking his mind dissipated as senior priests channeled Rebecca's power.\n\n\"Zednos, wake up!\"\n\nThe Overgeared security team surrounded him, weapons drawn. A quest notification hovered in their vision:\n\n**[An unidentified woman has appeared and deceived the people. Work with the priests of the Rebecca Church to calm the confusion.]**\n\n\"Fly!\" Zednos launched skyward, putting distance between himself and whatever that woman was.\n\n*What the hell just happened?*\n\nShe'd enslaved his will without effort, without warning. No ordinary being possessed that power.\n\nThe security team moved with practiced efficiency, soldiers and priests forming a perimeter around the woman.\n\nThen something struck the castle from above.\n\nThe impact crater smoked where a man now stood. Blond hair framed aristocratic features, and his name floated overhead: **Fenrir**.\n\n\"A direct descendant?\" One of the Overgeared members went pale.\n\nFenrir, Vampire Marquis. Second in the hierarchy beneath Beriache herself. Unique among his siblings for inheriting three of their mother's powers instead of one.\n\n\"You were here.\" Fenrir ignored the armed forces entirely, addressing only the turbaned woman. \"I was waiting for you to wake up. Now, let's go to my city. We have much to discuss.\"\n\nEvery eye swiveled to the woman.\n\nFenrir's deference told them everything.\n\n\"...Marie Rose?\"\n\nThe woman's red nails flashed as she removed her turban in one fluid motion.\n\n**[You have encountered Vampire Duke Marie Rose.]**\n\n**[Marie Rose's evil influence makes your magic power turbid. All types of spells and skills aren't available.]**\n\n**[A vampire's gaze will subdue lower species. You will lose your willpower and control over your body.]**\n\n**[Marie Rose's attraction is absolute. Her charm is so high that there are even high odds of both genders being attracted.]**\n\nPriests, soldiers, Overgeared members—everyone became statues.\n\nBlack silk cascaded past her waist as Marie Rose swept her hair back. Purity and decadence warred in features that transcended mere beauty, each element perfection, their combination devastating.\n\n\"You.\" Her gaze pinned Zednos. \"The strongest human in this city.\"\n\n\"...?\" Zednos couldn't form words.\n\n\"I smelled something nostalgic from you.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n*Smelled?* Zednos sniffed himself reflexively. Only the sweet scent of Noe Bread clung to his clothes.\n\n\"I hate the sun.\" Marie Rose addressed Fenrir without looking at him. \"Drive the carriage. The nearest forest—I've always wanted to see the elves.\"\n\n\"Bah.\" Fenrir seized a trembling priest by the neck and deposited him in the driver's seat. \"I don't drive carriages. You'll manage.\"\n\nThe priest whimpered.\n\nBlood erupted from thin air—massive thorns weaving through space like crimson spider webs. They impaled Fenrir from every angle, turning him into a pincushion. Blood leaked from his mouth as his eyes bulged.\n\nMarie Rose's expression never changed. \"Don't disobey me.\"\n\nFenrir nodded rapidly. She could birth new direct descendants. Replace him. Unlike Beriache—who'd been a Great Demon bound by certain limitations—Marie Rose possessed both power and the biological capacity to create heirs.\n\nShe was more dangerous than their mother had ever been.\n\n\"Let's depart.\"\n\nMarie Rose entered the carriage. Fenrir's wounds sealed instantly as he took the reins. The priest beside him shook so violently the bench rattled.\n\nFenrir raised the whip.\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\nA group materialized, blocking the carriage's path.\n\n\"Marie Rose!\" The leader wore white vestments embroidered with gold sacred patterns—the Pope's regalia. \"I rushed here as soon as the divine message revealed your awakening!\"\n\nThree women flanked Pope Damian, divine artifacts blazing in their grips. Lifael's Spear, Michael's Sword, and Everiel's Shield—the same weapons that had sealed Marie Rose centuries ago.\n\nDivine power erupted across the courtyard, brilliant as the sun. The Overgeared members gasped as their status ailments burned away. Even Fenrir flinched.\n\nDamian stood wreathed in full buffs, power radiating from every pore.\n\n\"Return to your coffin for humanity's sake!\"\n\nThe hidden quest **[Seal Marie Rose]** had appeared in his vision moments ago. Damian's confidence soared—these divine artifacts had sealed her before. History would repeat itself.\n\n\"Keok!\"\n\nBlood exploded from Damian's chest before he'd taken a step forward.\n\nFenrir moved like lightning, overwhelming the Rebecca's Daughters and hurling a blood spear that punched through the Pope's divine barriers. Damian collapsed, critically wounded.\n\n\"You're insane, Pope.\" Fenrir stood over him. \"Did you forget? Chreshler was exceptional. You're not.\"\n\nStill, wariness flickered across Fenrir's features. The Rebecca Church *had* sealed Marie Rose once. He wouldn't underestimate them again.\n\nHe moved with brutal efficiency—striking Isabel aside, deflecting Rin's blade, shattering Luna's shield. His hand closed around Damian's throat.\n\n\"Don't kill him.\"\n\nMarie Rose's voice drifted from the carriage, tinged with amusement.\n\n\"A nostalgic smell comes from him as well. I'd rather not be hated—keep him alive.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nNo one understood. Even Fenrir looked confused. But he released Damian without question and returned to the driver's seat.\n\nThe Rebecca's Daughters couldn't pursue. Terror paralyzed them—Marie Rose's casual display of power had exceeded their worst estimates.\n\n*Clatter. Clatter.*\n\nThe carriage rolled past.\n\nDamian, the Rebecca's Daughters, Zednos, and the Overgeared security team watched it disappear.\n\n***\n\n**[(Breaking News) Vampire Duke's appearance!]**\n\n**[The pope and Rebecca's Daughters were overwhelmed...]**\n\nFootage spread across the internet within hours. Players watched Fenrir demolish Damian in seconds, alarm rippling through forums.\n\nBut unlike previous crises—the Great Demon, the Orc Lord—panic didn't take hold.\n\nThis was the Overgeared Kingdom. Grid would handle it. He always did.\n\nInstead, fan cafes exploded overnight. Marie Rose and Fenrir appreciation threads multiplied. People argued that vampires and humans should unite, that coexistence was possible.\n\n(Mainly because they were attractive.)\n\nAnd everyone wondered about that phrase: *nostalgic smell.*\n\nWhat did it mean?\n\nGrid, reading the reports in his quarters, developed a new habit.\n\nHe sniffed his armpits."
