  "content": "Grid stared at the cave entrance, weighing his options. The 64th island presented a unique challenge—and he'd devised what seemed like the perfect strategy.\n\n*Mining. I'll just mine everything.*\n\nHope surged through him as he surveyed his forces. The Overgeared Skeletons wielded rare-rated pickaxes that granted Beginner Mining Technique Level 5. His God Hands carried epic-rated versions that maxed out the beginner skill entirely. Noe and Randy bore unique-rated pickaxes, providing Intermediate Mining Technique Level 1.\n\n*With this setup, I can strip this island clean before my supplies run out. Even if it takes longer, I'll just return with enough food for several months.*\n\nSimple. Straightforward. A dungeon solved through preparation rather than combat prowess.\n\nReality, however, had other plans.\n\nThree hours of relentless excavation revealed the cruel truth—the minerals *regenerated*. The moment Grid's team extracted ore from a vein, fresh deposits materialized in the exact same location. The 64th island's resources were infinite, its challenge insurmountable through conventional mining.\n\n\"This is absolutely ridiculous,\" Grid muttered, hurling his pickaxe aside.\n\nNoe and Randy had abandoned their posts long ago, sprawled on the cave floor in defeat. What was the point of working when their labor meant nothing?\n\n\"Maybe I can collapse the entire cave.\"\n\nHe tested the theory immediately. The Enlightenment Blade sang through the air, black flames erupting across the cavern walls.\n\n*Boom! Crash!*\n\nThe explosions echoed magnificently. The cave didn't budge. The mineral deposits caught in the blasts remained untouched, already sprouting fresh growth. Like every other game, Satisfy featured both destructible and indestructible terrain. The 64th island firmly belonged to the latter category.\n\n*How am I supposed to clear this nightmare?*\n\nEven Gis' invincibility seemed less of a puzzle than this. The island felt deliberately designed to torment players—a cruel joke from the developers.\n\n\"Nothing's ever straightforward,\" Grid growled.\n\n*Thunk!*\n\nHe snatched up a chunk of iron ore and threw it in frustration. \n\nDeath Knight Gis, who'd been mining with mechanical precision since Grid's arrival, suddenly froze mid-swing.\n\n\"...Nyang?\"\n\nNoe's eyes widened, his tongue lolling out in surprise. The death knight had actually *stopped*.\n\nBut Grid wasn't paying attention. He refused to look at the hateful bastard who'd caused him so much grief.\n\n*Clang! Clang!*\n\nGis resumed mining.\n\n\"Master! Do it again!\" Noe's voice rose with excitement.\n\n\"What?\" Grid blinked, uncomprehending. He'd thrown the ore in blind anger, barely aware of his own actions.\n\n\"Throw the iron ore, nyong!\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n*Why?*\n\nThe question formed, but Grid's body moved before his mind could catch up. He'd learned to trust Noe's instincts without hesitation.\n\n*Thunk!*\n\nThe ore sailed through the air.\n\n*Click.*\n\nGis froze again.\n\nGrid's head snapped around. Noe sat with his forelimbs crossed, radiating smug satisfaction.\n\n\"Nyahahat! See this one's incredible insight? I am the best demonic beast of hell, nyang! Nyahahat!\"\n\n\"Good—excellent work! You really are the best!\"\n\n*I've found it.* Grid's pulse quickened. *The strategy for the 64th island.*\n\nHe hurled another ore chunk. Gis locked up like a statue. Grid's blade was already moving.\n\n\"Link!\"\n\n*Slash-slash-slash-slash-slash!*\n\nThe Enlightenment Blade carved through the darkness. Death Knight Gis' scream echoed through the cave.\n\n\"*Kiyaaaaah!*\"\n\nInvincibility shattered. Health plummeted.\n\n---\n\nWatching through his crystal ball, Sticks trembled with admiration.\n\n*He solved the 64th island in mere hours...*\n\nThe basic requirement was mining skill—Grid satisfied this through his production abilities. By removing minerals, he'd disrupted Gis' inherent \"love of minerals,\" breaking the invincibility state. \n\n*Though of course...*\n\nGis was a legendary tank, famous for his defense. Even without invincibility, Grid would struggle to—\n\n\"Pinnacle Kill!\"\n\n*...Or not.*\n\n---\n\n> [You have dealt 42,350 damage to the target!]\n\nWith Noe's revelation, Grid had disabled the invincibility mechanic. Link battered against Gis' defenses—impressive defenses, three times as solid as the previous death knights. Ordinary attacks barely scratched him.\n\nBut Grid possessed defense-penetrating techniques. Pinnacle. And more importantly, Pinnacle Kill—a skill that completely ignored armor.\n\n*Crack-crack-crack-crack!*\n\nThe empowered thrust carved away massive chunks of Gis' health. The death knight retaliated immediately.\n\n> [You have suffered 2,700 damage.]\n\nGrid barely felt it. The pickaxe glanced off Triple Layers' reinforced plating. Without invincibility, Gis was just target practice.\n\n> [The hidden passive 'God's Command' has reset the cooldown of Pinnacle Kill. If reused within three seconds, no resources will be consumed.]\n\n\"Pinnacle Kill!\"\n\n*Shiiing!*\n\nThe guardian of the 64th island—source of so much frustration—crumbled under the relentless assault.\n\n> [You have defeated Death Knight Gis, guardian of the 64th island!]\n> [The 64th island has been cleansed!]\n> [As a reward for cleansing the island, you have gained one level!]\n> [Gis' Pickaxe has been acquired!]\n\n\"Wait...\"\n\nGrid frowned. The 64th island's difficulty had been astronomical. Sure, Gis himself was manageable in direct combat, but discovering the strategy bordered on impossible. Without that lucky throw, he'd have been trapped here indefinitely.\n\nSuch extreme difficulty deserved extraordinary rewards.\n\n\"But...\"\n\nOne pickaxe?\n\nHe sighed, activating Legendary Blacksmith's Appraisal without much hope.\n\n*Ding~*\n\n> **[Gis' Pickaxe]**\n> Rating: Legendary\n> Durability: 300/366 | Attack Power: 190\n> \n> * 20% increased chance of acquiring advanced minerals\n> * 8% increased chance of acquiring highest grade minerals  \n> * Mining skill +3\n> * Mining speed +150%\n> * Defense +40% while mining\n> * Low probability of entering 'Invincible' state when mining\n> \n> *A pickaxe that legendary miner Gis treasured in life. He loved this tool so dearly that he requested to be buried with it.*\n> \n> Conditions of Use: Anyone with mining skill\n> Weight: 111\n\n\"Wow...\"\n\n*So when Pagma dug up Gis' corpse, he stole the pickaxe too?*\n\nBraham's warnings about Pagma's character echoed in Grid's mind. But that didn't matter right now—not when examining this magnificent tool.\n\nEnhanced mineral acquisition rates. Skill bonuses. Massively increased mining speed. And most importantly, the defensive buff and invincibility chance.\n\n*Could this draw aggro?*\n\nAn image of Peak Sword flashed through Grid's mind.\n\n*Next time we encounter enemies, I'll just make him mine minerals...*\n\nPerfect tanking solution. Peak Sword's class was supposedly high-damage, but Grid had long since reclassified him. Ever since the Hell Gao raid, the man's mining contributions had far exceeded his combat value.\n\n---\n\n> [You have entered the 65th island.]\n\nTwo islands remaining. Just the 65th and 66th stood between Grid and complete purification of the Behen Archipelago—a dungeon that had remained unconquered for years.\n\n*The Hall of Fame will reopen once I finish.*\n\nGrid's name would be immortalized at the very top. The symbolic significance was immeasurable.\n\nHis spirits soared. Step by step, he was closing the gap with Kraugel's reputation.\n\n*Rustle.*\n\nGrid advanced into the 65th island's environment—a vast forest echoing with birdsong and insect chatter. Massive trees blocked out the sun, casting everything in perpetual twilight. The terrain screamed \"archer territory,\" with countless elevated sniper positions.\n\n*Has to be Povia.*\n\nThe legendary archer would defend this—\n\n*Whoosh!*\n\nPain exploded in Grid's chest. The birdsong had masked the arrow's flight entirely. By the time he registered the attack, the projectile had already pierced his armor.\n\n> [You have suffered 6,993 damage.]\n\n\"Damn...! A godly archer indeed.\"\n\nEven through Triple Layers' enhanced physical resistance, the damage was staggering. He'd underestimated archers—forgot they boasted the highest attack power among physical damage dealers. Grid summoned his Holy Light Shield, preparing to deflect follow-up shots.\n\n*Find the location first.*\n\nStandard anti-sniper tactics: track the arrow trajectory, identify the firing position, close the distance. Archers excelled at range but crumbled in melee. Simple.\n\nExcept Povia was a *legendary* archer. She wouldn't make amateur mistakes like exposing her position.\n\n*Whistle-whistle-whistle!*\n\n*Thud-thud-thud-thud!*\n\nArrows rained from directly overhead, dozens of projectiles falling like a steel storm. Grid couldn't pinpoint the source.\n\n\"Rain Arrows,\" he muttered.\n\nThe skill fired volleys skyward that descended on targets from above—wide area coverage, unpredictable impact points. And most importantly, it concealed the archer's actual position. With these towering trees blocking his line of sight, Grid had no way to locate Povia's nest.\n\n\"Noe! Randy!\"\n\nHe summoned both pets, sending them scattering through the forest.\n\n\"Search the trees! Report the moment you find where the arrows are coming from!\"\n\nThe instant Grid issued his command—\n\n*Ding~*\n\nRed apple icons materialized above Noe and Randy's heads, hovering over their hearts.\n\n*Thwip. Thwip-thwip!*\n\nArrows punched through each apple symbol with surgical precision.\n\n\"Nyaang!\"\n\n\"Kyaak!\"\n\nBoth pets crashed to the ground.\n\n\"What—?!\"\n\nGrid's alarm spiked as apple icons suddenly appeared across his own body—face, stomach, heart, lungs, elbow, wrist. A dozen targeting markers.\n\nThe Targeting skill."
