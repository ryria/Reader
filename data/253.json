Kraugel.\n\nHao had met him before—one year ago, in Elgad Forest.\n\nAt the time, even users in the top 100 rankings needed to form parties of at least seven rankers to hunt there. The killer spiders and butterflies that infested those woods were merciless. Yet Kraugel had been playing solo. Hao watched him slaughter monsters with surgical precision, and the realization hit like a hammer blow.\n\n*This is a mountain that can't be climbed.*\n\nThey existed in completely different dimensions. The battle sense that leveraged every rock and tree. The godly control that turned terrain into weaponry. Hao couldn't even aspire to reach that level. Kraugel wasn't just a rival. He was an awe-inspiring wall, insurmountable and absolute.\n\nThat encounter marked the first time Hao—praised as a genius his entire life—tasted inferiority.\n\n*Why?*\n\nThe question clawed at him now as he stood in Reidan's fields. The mysterious farmer fighting Seuron. Hao's pulse quickened. He had replayed Kraugel's movements in his mind a thousand times over the past year, burned them into his memory. Every stance. Every pivot. Every feint.\n\nThe farmer moved with that same impossible grace.\n\n\"White Light Sword.\"\n\nThe farmer's voice carried across the field. Brilliant light erupted from his blade, a large-scale attack designed to blind and overwhelm. Hao closed his eyes against the searing radiance. When he opened them, Seuron was dissolving into grey particles.\n\n\"Ha...\" A laugh escaped him, hollow and breathless. \"Haha.\"\n\nKraugel had dismantled Seuron—a fighter on Hao's own level—like he was nothing. The sky above the sky. That title wasn't hyperbole. Kraugel hadn't just maintained his strength. He'd grown. Hao's legs trembled, fear and exhilaration warring in his chest.\n\n\"Run away.\" The words came out hoarse. He turned to his guild members, forcing authority into his tone. \"Now!\"\n\nInvade Reidan? The notion was laughable. As long as Kraugel stood here, this place was an impregnable fortress. No siege, no strategy, no numbers would matter.\n\n\"Run away!\" Hao shouted.\n\nThe Hades Guild scattered.\n\n***\n\nDamian wiped sweat from his brow. \"Should we just let them go?\"\n\nKraugel tilted his head, straw hat casting shadows across his face. \"Then should we chase them?\"\n\n\"Um...\" Damian considered. \"There is no need.\"\n\n*I don't need to fight.*\n\nPursuing a routed enemy served no purpose. They were farmers, not Reidan's guardian knights. Their job was to protect the fields, nothing more.\n\nReidan's defense belonged to Grid and the Overgeared Guild. This wasn't their problem. They'd only gotten involved because of Piaro in the first place. Still, Reidan stood unharmed. It could have been disastrous if they hadn't moved.\n\n*Anyway, it's okay now.*\n\nA small swell of pride warmed Damian's chest. He'd helped protect Grid's estate, after all.\n\n\"By the way, who are you?\"\n\nDamian knew Seuron's reputation well. The man was evaluated as stronger than Grid himself. Yet this farmer had dismantled him with ease. That straw hat—the one that hadn't come off once during their week of fieldwork—felt especially irritating today.\n\nKraugel's mouth curved into a faint smile. \"You aren't the type of person who will be interested.\"\n\nDamian didn't argue. \"That's right.\"\n\nHis obsession belonged to Rebecca's Daughters alone. Everything else was noise.\n\n\"Shit! You damn bastards!\" A Golden Guild member's voice cracked with panic. \"They're running away!\"\n\n\"Let's go!\" another shouted.\n\n\"How rotten! I won't step foot on this land again!\"\n\nThe Golden Guild broke formation. Once the Hades Guild retreated from the farmer, they knew the battle was lost. Pride meant nothing when survival was at stake.\n\nBland swallowed the last of his third rainbow potato. His face creased with worry. \"Isn't dinner time over? Do we have to starve this evening?\"\n\nDamian and Kraugel exchanged glances. They'd heard Bland was from a prestigious noble family, but the stress of being taken hostage must have been severe.\n\n***\n\nBox, chief of staff for the Snake Guild. The first-ranked Linker. The last survivor.\n\n\"This ability is very interesting.\" Piaro's voice held genuine appreciation as he studied Box's movements. \"It is really great that you can blend the skills of your colleagues, making them more powerful and efficient.\"\n\nThe compliment brought Box no joy. Piaro had praised many of his colleagues earlier—right before killing them. *In any case, I'm going to die.*\n\nBox triggered his last gambit. **Puppet**, the Linker's ultimate skill, flared to life. Magic threads shot toward Piaro, seeking to seize control of his body.\n\nUseless.\n\nPiaro had grown through this battle, evolved beyond what Box could comprehend. He closed the distance before the skill fully activated and overpowered Box's attempt at control. Even if the magic had taken hold, Box's willpower couldn't have dominated Piaro's.\n\n*Puk!*\n\nThe hand plow—wrapped in colorless qi—punched through Box's forehead.\n\n*Dying by a hand plow!* The absurdity of it burned through Box's fading consciousness. He would be the 275th protagonist of the rumor.\n\n\"K-Kuock...!\"\n\nBox dissolved into grey light.\n\nPiaro stood silently, watching. His eyes reflected the depth of the sea. Since beginning his fieldwork in Reidan, Piaro had grown steadily. Today's battle had crystallized that growth into something profound.\n\n*I'm not Muller.*\n\nThe truth settled over him like rain. He was Piaro. Just Piaro.\n\nNoble of the Saharan Empire.\n\nCaptain of the Red Knights.\n\nTraitor.\n\nGreat Swordsman.\n\nFarmer.\n\nFriend of Grid, the Overgeared Guild, Kraugel, Damian, and Bland.\n\nYes. He was distinctly, utterly different from Muller. There was no need to chase that specter anymore.\n\n*I am enough by myself.*\n\n*Shaaaaaah.*\n\nLight from the two moons poured over Piaro's body, luminous as the Milky Way. An intense, unsteady energy rose from him. The atmosphere trembled. At this moment, Piaro became a legend.\n\nWas it the Sword Saint status he'd craved for so long?\n\nNo.\n\nPiaro had already accepted that a sword wasn't necessary. He could achieve everything with agricultural equipment—hand plow, sickle, hoe. There was no need to obsess over titles.\n\n> **[A legendary farmer has been born!]**\n>\n> **[Every farmer in the world will look up to him and praise him!]**\n\nThe notification window appeared before every user connected to Satisfy. Within minutes, it was breaking news across international media.\n\nDamian and Kraugel, who witnessed Piaro's evolution directly, stood frozen in confusion.\n\n*Why a farmer?*\n\nPiaro was a swordsman. They'd seen his blade work. But he became a farmer instead...\n\nThe disconnect was staggering. Yet Piaro radiated happiness. What did titles matter? Farmer or Sword Saint—he was already enough. There was no need to argue over labels.\n\n\"Pagma...\" Piaro's voice was soft, wondering. \"Were you also like me?\"\n\nThe Great Swordsman who became a Legendary Blacksmith. Pagma must have walked a similar path. Piaro smiled at the thought.\n\nA farmer was supreme. When he plowed the land, it became fertile. When he wielded farming equipment, he could destroy hundreds of enemies.\n\nThe new legends were a blacksmith and a farmer.\n\n***\n\n\"Pant... pant... Shit, it's hard to move.\"\n\nThe desert night bit through armor and flesh, cold enough to freeze bone. The surviving Golden Guild members trudged through sand, their morale shattered.\n\n*We were beaten by a farmer.*\n\n*Surely they won't chase us?*\n\nConfusion and fear weighed heavier with each step. The endless desert stretched before them, every dune identical to the last. Nerves frayed. Paranoia set in.\n\n*Kuwaaah!*\n\n*Kyaooooh!*\n\nGiant worms erupted from the sand. Desert toads appeared from behind rocks. The monsters were relentless.\n\n\"Shit...!\" One member gasped after they barely defeated a giant worm. \"If only Master was here!\"\n\nFor players averaging below level 230, the western monsters were brutal. They'd taken Seuron's strength for granted. What kind of monster was that farmer to kill Seuron so easily?\n\n\"Pay attention!\" Their temporary leader barked. \"Or else we'll be wiped out!\"\n\nThe Golden Guild members fought with desperation, fueled by nothing but the desire to survive. They gritted their teeth through battle after battle. But effort alone couldn't overcome the level gap.\n\nEventually, less than 100 survived. Those still standing had nearly depleted health, mana, and stamina pools.\n\n*Where did it go wrong?*\n\n*Why is one of the strongest guilds in Satisfy suffering like this?*\n\nAs despair settled over them like a shroud, someone muttered the answer.\n\n\"We shouldn't have touched Grid...\"\n\nSilence followed.\n\nThe Golden Guild members hadn't even seen Grid. Yet he was the cause of all this suffering. Grid was expanding his forces. The seven guilds felt threatened and invaded Reidan to contain him.\n\nThe result was annihilation.\n\nTheir fear of Grid metastasized into something visceral. The Golden Guild members felt sick at seeing even the initial **G**. They made silent vows never to step on Grid's shadow again.\n\n*Kuooooh!*\n\nSomething massive appeared in the sky. A red drake.\n\n\"This...!\"\n\nThey were exhausted to their limits. Now a drake was hunting them.\n\n\"Keep your formations!\"\n\n\"Aaaagh!\"\n\n*Kwa kwa kwa kwang!*\n\nIt had lost some majesty after Noe's advent, but drakes were still classified as the strongest pets. Fire poured from its maw. The cooled desert sand burned red. Three figures materialized before the Golden Guild through the flames.\n\nFamiliar faces.\n\n\"These bastards...\" A distraught bald man flushed crimson with rage. \"Are they already going back after destroying Reidan?\"\n\nHe wielded his axe with murderous intent.\n\n\"V-Vantner...!\"\n\nThe first-ranked Guardian Knight. A monster who boasted overwhelming tanking ability and ogre-level strength. He absorbed the Golden Guild's attacks with his shield, then slaughtered them with twin axes.\n\nBeast Master Toon was even more terrifying.\n\n\"You guys dare attack our city!\" Toon's voice cracked like a whip. \"Grid's city!\"\n\nHis silver wristblades became slick with blood in seconds. The blood of Golden Guild members.\n\nThe accusation was false. The survivors would have felt less wronged if they'd actually shattered Reidan. But they hadn't even invaded properly. They'd been defeated by farmers and fled before entering the city. Yet they were being butchered anyway.\n\n*We need a savior.*\n\nThe Golden Guild members' eyes rolled frantically, searching. Unlike Vantner and Toon, Huroi watched the situation with a calm expression. He seemed rational. Sane.\n\n\"Huroi!\" They crawled toward him, voices breaking. \"Please spare us! We didn't do any damage to Reidan!\"\n\n\"We are greatly reflecting!\" Another sobbed. \"Please calm those two down!\"\n\nHuroi studied them for a long moment. The begging. The tears. Then he spoke.\n\n\"Your parents should live a long and happy life.\"\n\n\"Heok...\"\n\nThere were lines that shouldn't be crossed. Mentioning someone's parents was one of them. The Golden Guild members—already brutalized—understood in that instant.\n\nHuroi was worse than Vantner and Toon combined.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**\n\n**OG:** Glossary Link.\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\n**Check out my Patreon** for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
