  "content": "# The Fall of Eternal and the Rise of Opposition\n\nThe reports sat untouched on Emperor Juander's mahogany desk. Intelligence from the West Continent detailed how Grid had shattered the Eternal Kingdom and laid the foundation for a new realm. The Emperor of the Saharan Empire glanced at the documents once, then returned to his wine without a second thought.\n\nTo him, this was nothing more than a border skirmish—inconsequential noise from a backwater province.\n\nGrid had inherited legendary power. His reputation spread like wildfire across the continent. But what of it? The empire cultivated dozens of talents equal to or surpassing this upstart blacksmith. Why waste attention on someone destined to collapse under their own hubris?\n\n\"That's what His Majesty said,\" 1st Prince Roland explained, a knowing smile playing at the corners of his mouth.\n\nAcross the tea table, 2nd Prince Dulandal noted his empty cup and raised two fingers toward the attending maid. As she refilled his porcelain teacup with steaming amber liquid, he posed the question that had been weighing on his mind.\n\n\"Brother, what do you think? Can we truly afford to leave Grid unattended?\"\n\nRoland lifted his replenished cup, inhaling the fragrant steam before nodding slowly. \"I'm well aware that legendary power transcends human limitations. But ultimately, it remains the strength of an individual.\" He took a measured sip. \"What can one man—however powerful—accomplish against Saharan? Our empire dominates this continent for a reason.\"\n\n\"The empire harbors many who transcend human limitations,\" Dulandal agreed, his fingers drumming thoughtfully against his cup.\n\n\"Precisely. But there's another factor at play.\" Roland set down his tea and leaned forward. \"Grid is a traitor. He usurped his throne through rebellion against the rightful royal family. The kingdoms of the continent cannot—*will not*—tolerate his existence.\"\n\nDulandal's eyes gleamed with understanding. \"Acknowledging Grid would set a dangerous precedent. It would give common folk ideas above their station.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Every kingdom will pray for Grid's destruction. They'll pressure him constantly, checking his every move.\" Roland's smile widened. \"Grid and whatever kingdom he builds will collapse under their own weight. We need only watch.\"\n\nThe two princes—sons of Empress Aria, who had departed this world six years prior—shared a moment of rare unity. Both possessed exceptional ability and adaptability, qualities that had once made them prime candidates for the throne. Yet in recent years, their political capital had eroded like sand beneath the tide.\n\nEmpress Marie, the Emperor's current favorite, had orchestrated their isolation with surgical precision. The court now whispered that 4th Prince Edan—Marie's son—would wear the crown. The winds of succession had shifted, leaving Roland and Dulandal grasping at whatever influence remained.\n\n***\n\n## The Council of Kingdoms\n\nAfter the annihilation of Eternal's royal bloodline, representatives from fifteen kingdoms assembled in solemn conclave. The Saharan Empire, secure in its supremacy, sent no envoy. The gathering took place in the Gauss Kingdom, whose borders pressed close against the ruins of Eternal.\n\nKing Cactus—a portly man whose jowls and round face brought to mind a toad—opened the session with practiced diplomacy. \"I'm grateful that princes of such prestigious nations have answered my summons.\"\n\n\"The honor is ours, King Cactus,\" replied one prince with a respectful bow.\n\nAnother added, \"My father sends his regrets that duties of state prevented his personal attendance.\"\n\nThe meeting hall hummed with cordial energy. These representatives had gathered with singular purpose—to discuss the threat posed by the so-called Overgeared Kingdom, which would soon declare its independence.\n\n\"No peace for a kingdom born of rebellion,\" declared a prince from the eastern territories, slamming his fist on the table.\n\n\"Agreed,\" another chimed in. \"Rebellion cannot be glorified. Our citizens must understand this.\"\n\n\"The Overgeared Kingdom must be dismantled swiftly.\"\n\n\"Economic pressure, then. Sanctions.\"\n\n\"Obviously. We refuse diplomatic recognition of Overgeared.\"\n\n\"Isolate them completely. Let them wither on the vine.\"\n\nThe princes spoke over one another, their enthusiasm building. King Cactus observed their fervor with an indulgent smile that emphasized his toad-like features.\n\n\"Isolation is certainly essential,\" he said, raising one pudgy hand to quiet the chamber. \"But I propose we send representatives to Overgeared's founding ceremony.\"\n\nThe room fell silent. Several princes frowned in confusion.\n\n\"Why would we send delegates to celebrate a kingdom we refuse to recognize?\" one asked, suspicion creeping into his voice.\n\n\"Do you wish to legitimize this travesty?\" demanded another.\n\nBacklash rippled through the assembled nobles. King Cactus shook his head, his smile never wavering.\n\n\"Not to celebrate. We'll send delegations to deliver an ultimatum—if Grid refuses to pay tribute to all fifteen of our kingdoms, we'll condemn him before the world. How does that sound?\"\n\nUnderstanding dawned across the princes' faces.\n\n\"Brilliant! Tribute from the Overgeared Kingdom...\"\n\n\"It will expose their weakness from the very beginning!\"\n\n\"This will accelerate their destruction! Hahahaha!\"\n\nRaucous laughter filled the meeting hall, echoing off stone walls. The founding ceremony of the Overgeared Kingdom was ten days away.\n\n***\n\n## Bloodshed in Levanfield\n\nLevanfield nestled in the shadow of mountains, a modest farming town a day's ride from Reinhardt. Normally, it buzzed with the quiet industry of agricultural life. Now, an unnatural silence hung over the settlement like a burial shroud. From the surrounding hills, it resembled a ghost town—abandoned, lifeless, forgotten.\n\n\"Hik... Hiik... P-Please, sir... Spare us...\"\n\nInside Levanfield's grain warehouses, over two thousand residents huddled together in abject terror. Tears and snot streamed down their faces as they clutched each other.\n\nEarl Logan's voice cracked like a whip. \"**Shut your mouths!** The king lies dead, the kingdom drowns in chaos, and you *dare* cling to your worthless lives?\"\n\nGenuine rage burned in Earl Logan's eyes. His gaze fixed on the banner hanging from the warehouse's central beam—not the silver dragon of Eternal, but a hammer crossed with an anvil.\n\n\"These *commoners*...\" He spat the word like poison. \"This town supports the rebels who've seized our kingdom! You're all turncoats. Traitors who deserve death!\"\n\n\"H-Hik...!\" The residents' sobbing intensified.\n\nEarl Logan's hand moved to his sword hilt. He would execute them all, every man, woman, and child. Before he could draw the blade, Marquis Vedaman's calm voice cut through the tension.\n\n\"Are you planning to dull your blade before tomorrow's holy war?\" The marquis examined his manicured fingernails with disinterest. \"Don't waste energy on pigs who'll eat whatever bread you throw them while groveling on hands and knees.\"\n\nAnother noble added, \"Marquis Vedaman speaks wisdom. We came to reclaim our kingdom from the traitor, not to slaughter livestock.\"\n\n\"Tch...\" Earl Logan's fingers loosened on his sword hilt.\n\nThe residents of Levanfield exhaled collectively, a wave of relief washing through the crowd. Marquis Vedaman approached them with measured steps, his boots clicking against the wooden floor.\n\n\"The hammer and anvil—that's the traitor Grid's symbol, yes?\"\n\n\"Y-Yes! Yes, that's right!\" stammered a middle-aged farmer. \"A few days ago, soldiers from Reinhardt arrived and changed our flag!\"\n\n*SEOKEOK!*\n\nSteel flashed in the warehouse's dim light. The farmer's head tumbled from his shoulders, expression frozen in mid-sentence. His body remained standing for a heartbeat before collapsing, blood pooling across the floorboards.\n\nEarl Logan stood with his sword extended, blade dripping crimson. \"You *acknowledged* the rebels' kingdom!\" he roared, spittle flying from his lips. \"**You accepted their flag!**\"\n\n\"H-Hik...!\" \n\nThe color drained from every face in the warehouse. These past weeks had shattered their understanding of the world. The king—who had never once visited their town, never offered aid during harsh winters—was dead. The kingdom demanded crippling taxes that emptied their food stores. Why should they mourn? Why should they hate these rebels? \n\nWas it their fault that soldiers came and raised a new banner?\n\nThey'd been taught since childhood to obey the royal family and nobility without question. They'd only done what they'd always been told to do.\n\n\"This... this isn't our fault the kingdom fell!\" A young man's voice cut through the silence. He cradled his father's severed head, tears streaming down his face. \"**You** lost the country through your own weakness! Your own incompetence!\"\n\nShocked gasps rippled through the crowd at such audacity.\n\n\"And another thing!\" The young man's voice grew stronger despite his grief. \"This was always *our* kingdom! Eternal belongs to us—the people who work the fields, who built the walls, who bled for it! We're not your livestock!\"\n\n\"You **dare—**\" Earl Logan's face contorted into something demonic, veins bulging at his temples. His sword rose for another execution.\n\n\"**Stop.**\"\n\nThe warehouse's main doors swung open with a resounding *boom*. A middle-aged man stood silhouetted in the doorway, built like a bear—broad shoulders, thick limbs, and an presence that seemed to expand and fill the space. The moment he stepped into the warehouse, the air itself grew heavier.\n\n\"Marquis Steim...!\" someone breathed.\n\nThe legendary figure who had tamed the monster-infested northern territories through cunning and courage now stood before them. One of Eternal's greatest powers had arrived, throwing the entire situation into chaos. The nobles, Earl Logan included, stood frozen like rabbits before a wolf.\n\nMarquis Steim's gaze swept across the warehouse—the terrified residents, the headless corpse, the drawn weapons. He released a long, weary sigh.\n\n\"Must you drag common folk into your political games?\" His voice carried profound disappointment. \"I'm ashamed to call you fellow nobles of Eternal.\"\n\n\"Ik...! Eek!\" Earl Logan's face cycled through shades of white and red.\n\nAfter a moment of stunned silence, he found his voice and screamed, \"Marquis Steim! **Why have you come here?**\"\n\nEveryone knew the traitor Grid had married Marquis Steim's daughter. Everyone knew Marquis Steim had remained conspicuously neutral during the war, watching silently as the kingdom burned. Earl Logan's conviction solidified—Marquis Steim had allied himself with Grid.\n\nThe other nobles thought differently.\n\n\"Earl Logan! Show proper respect to Marquis Steim!\" one hissed urgently.\n\n\"Marquis Steim would never betray our kingdom!\" another insisted.\n\nMarquis Steim had served the royal family of Eternal with unwavering loyalty for decades. His inaction during the war didn't necessarily indicate support for Grid. Marquis Vedaman, who had personally invited Steim to this gathering, felt confidence surge through his chest.\n\n*Marquis Steim will surely support our independence movement.*\n\n\"I've known for many years that Marquis Steim doesn't let petty matters like marriage relations cloud his judgment,\" Marquis Vedaman said smoothly, stepping forward with an extended hand. \"I sincerely thank you for accepting my invitation. Together, we'll punish the usurper Grid and restore the Eternal Kingdom to its former glory.\"\n\n\"...\" \n\nMarquis Steim stared at the offered hand but didn't move to shake it. His expression remained unreadable. \"Do you truly not understand how Aslan claimed the throne?\"\n\n\"...Of course I know.\" Marquis Vedaman's hand wavered slightly. \"King Aslan murdered Prince Ren. However, that's history now—water under the bridge. There's no reason for us to fracture over Aslan's crimes. We must swiftly eliminate the rebels and install a proper, legitimate king.\"\n\nMarquis Steim shook his head slowly, deliberately. \"No. There is no legitimate king. The moment Prince Ren and King Aslan died, the direct bloodline of Wiesbaden was erased from this world.\"\n\n\"What?\" Marquis Vedaman's confidence cracked.\n\nWhile minor branches of the royal bloodline existed scattered throughout the kingdom, Marquis Steim's words carried undeniable implication. This wasn't ignorance—this was deliberate rejection of those distant relatives' claims.\n\n\"Marquis Steim!\" Marquis Vedaman's voice rose with accusation. \"So you *are* siding with your son-in-law after all?\"\n\nThe revelation struck like lightning. The nobles, knights, and soldiers drew their weapons in a unified metallic *shing*. Soldiers who'd been hiding outside the warehouse flooded in, surrounding Marquis Steim and his small retinue. Thousands of armed men formed an iron ring.\n\nMarquis Steim didn't so much as blink.\n\n\"My son-in-law may not be the 'rightful' king according to old blood and dusty traditions.\" His voice carried absolute conviction. \"But he's more than qualified to become a *new* king. Tell me—is there anyone in this world better suited to rule than a man who possesses overwhelming power, brilliant strategy, and inexhaustible resourcefulness?\" His eyes swept the crowd, challenging anyone to disagree. \"I'm certain that even the Emperor of Saharan doesn't surpass my son-in-law.\"\n\n\"**Nonsense!**\" Earl Logan couldn't contain himself any longer.\n\nHe lunged forward, sword raised to strike down the treasonous marquis. He managed two steps before his mouth filled with copper. Blood erupted from his lips in a crimson spray. He looked down in confusion at the sword protruding from his chest—a blade that had pierced him from *behind*.\n\nEarl Logan collapsed, dead before his body hit the floor.\n\nThe nobles whirled to face the assassin. Shock rippled through their ranks. The killer was someone they'd counted as a firm ally—a trusted member of their coalition. Viscount Chris stood with his bloodied sword extended, expression cold and resolute.\n\n\"Who... who are you?\" Marquis Vedaman choked out, his world crumbling.\n\nChris didn't acknowledge the question. Instead, he lowered his head respectfully toward Marquis Steim.\n\n\"A friend of Grid.\"\n\nA smile—genuine and warm—spread across Marquis Steim's face. \"A colleague of my son-in-law is also my colleague.\" He raised his voice, projecting authority. \"Laden. Kill the enemies.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\nThe Northern Nova moved.\n\nLaden—the young genius who'd once represented Eternal's finest—became a blur of motion. Black lightning given human form. Each time he appeared from the maelstrom of battle, half a dozen enemy soldiers crumpled with slit throats or pierced hearts. Blood misted the air.\n\nBut the alliance hadn't survived this long without skilled warriors. Veteran knights rallied, pressing Laden from multiple angles with coordinated attacks.\n\nThen Chris and the Giant Guild joined the fray.\n\n*KWARURURUNG!*\n\nGrid's Greatsword roared like a feral beast as Chris swept it through the enemy formation. The massive blade cleaved through armor, bone, and flesh with equal ease. Bodies flew like ragdolls.\n\n> [The 'Against Grid Alliance' quest has been abandoned.]\n> [Quest rewards have been permanently destroyed.]\n\nQuest rewards? *What value could they possibly hold compared to a future alongside Grid?*\n\nChris and every member of the Giant Guild understood this truth in their bones. Some opportunities only came once in a lifetime.\n\n\"**Kill them all!**\" Chris bellowed, his sword singing. \"**Don't let a single one reach Reinhardt!**\"\n\n\"Kuaaack! Chrissss!\" Marquis Vedaman's scream cut off abruptly as steel found his throat.\n\nOne by one, the remaining nobles of Eternal fell. Their blood soaked into the warehouse floor, mixing with spilled grain and the dreams of a kingdom that would never be restored.\n\nThe founding ceremony of the Overgeared Kingdom was seven days away."
