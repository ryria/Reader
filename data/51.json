Group reveals the existence of second classes in Satisfy. These advanced classes grant users access to expanded weapon proficiencies, exclusive skills, and rare stat types. Most significantly, each level grants two additional stat points. Reporter Cho Sungjin has the details.\"\n\nThe camera cut to a young man in a crisp suit. \"This is Cho Sungjin. At one o'clock this morning, S.A. Group confirmed that the first second class has been obtained. While the specific class remains undisclosed, industry experts theorize that Satisfy's vast content allows for numerous second class variants. The primary advantage lies in the stat distribution—twelve points per level instead of the standard ten...\"\n\n**The United States.**\n\n\"James, what can you tell us about this mysterious second class?\"\n\nThe correspondent shook his head. \"S.A. Group refuses to divulge specifics. They cite privacy protection for the user in question...\"\n\n**The United Kingdom.**\n\n\"Breaking news just in.\" The anchor leaned forward. \"We've confirmed the first second class user is from Mongolia.\"\n\nHis co-host blinked. \"Mongolia? Do they even play Satisfy there?\"\n\n\"The statistics are fascinating.\" The anchor pulled up a chart. \"In developed nations, roughly sixty percent of the population engages with Satisfy. Mongolia? A mere three percent.\"\n\n\"Good lord.\" The co-host studied the screen. \"We're at sixty-eight percent. You're telling me that sixty-eight percent of Britain couldn't achieve what one Mongolian did?\" He groaned. \"We're broadcasting our incompetence to the world.\"\n\n**China.**\n\nA stern-faced analyst addressed the camera. \"S.A. Group maintains ironclad data security. The leak regarding this Mongolian user appears deliberate—likely a marketing strategy to expand Satisfy's reach in that region.\"\n\nHis colleague nodded gravely. \"S.A. Group seeks global domination through Satisfy. They're manufacturing addiction, turning the world's population into slaves of their system. Treatment centers for game dependency will become necessities...\"\n\n**Japan.**\n\n\"I find it encouraging that an Asian claimed this achievement first.\" The host smiled. \"When will Japan produce a second class user?\"\n\n\"As you know, seventy-one percent of Japan's population enjoys Satisfy. We have the numbers.\" The expert gestured confidently. \"A Japanese player obtained an epic class months ago. I expect one of our users to claim the second occurrence of this achievement.\"\n\n\"But doesn't Korea have a seventy-three percent player base? By population ratio, they're the most engaged. Could the second user emerge from Korea?\"\n\nThe expert's smile faltered. \"...Perhaps S.A. Group will arrange something for them...\"\n\n\"Besides Yura at rank five, Korea has produced no successful high-rankers. Ironic, considering Satisfy's developer is a Korean company.\"\n\n\"Speaking of Yura, there are rumors S.A. Group sponsors her.\"\n\n\"Rumors? What's your source?\"\n\n\"Well... the internet—\"\n\n\"Please refrain from unsubstantiated claims. One slip could spark an international incident.\"\n\n\"My apologies...\"\n\n---\n\nThe second class phenomenon dominated global media. Special broadcasts dissected every angle.\n\nMeanwhile, Shin Youngwoo escaped the dungeon, left Rabbit behind, and logged out. He collapsed in front of his TV, a pot of ramyun bubbling beside him as he watched the coverage.\n\nHe stirred his noodles listlessly. \"This is ridiculous. Two extra stat points per level? That's completely broken.\" He slurped the broth. \"What lucky bastard got it?\" \n\n*Ah, damn. I'm sick with envy.*\n\nIt never occurred to him that he knew the person in question.\n\n---\n\n***\n\nDinner that evening was a family affair.\n\nYoungwoo set down his chopsticks. \"I'm quitting the labor office.\"\n\nSilence crashed over the table.\n\nHis father's eyes lit up. \"My son finally landed a proper job? Excellent! I knew you had it in you.\"\n\nSehee clapped her hands. \"Really? You're going to be an employee? Congratulations! What should I get you as a gift?\"\n\nHis mother dabbed at her eyes. \"Thank goodness. I've been heartbroken watching you suffer at those construction sites. You've been through so much...\"\n\nYoungwoo braced himself. He'd expected joy.\n\nReality proved crueler.\n\n*Tak!*\n\nHis father slammed his spoon onto the table.\n\n\"Are you giving up again?\" The words came out flat. Cold.\n\nHis mother sighed deeply. \"No matter how hard it is... How will you repay your debts? What about your future? Marriage?\"\n\nSehee clicked her tongue. \"How can an adult be so selfish? You're planning to mooch off our parents until you're old? You're pathetic.\"\n\nYoungwoo's jaw dropped. *Unbelievable. My own family.*\n\n\"Who said anything about playing around?\" He leaned forward. \"Why assume quitting labor work means giving up? Why not assume your son—your brother—found something better?\"\n\nSehee's eyes widened in exaggerated surprise. \"What? You got a new job? Someone actually hired you?\"\n\nHis mother murmured to herself. \"Maybe a convenience store? But those pay less per hour than labor work...\"\n\nHis father's expression hardened. \"Youngwoo, tell me you didn't get scammed by another 'friend' into one of those multi-level marketing schemes.\"\n\n\"No! Nothing like that!\" Youngwoo spread his hands. \"I've got an amazing opportunity!\"\n\n\"Which is?\"\n\n\"Professional gamer. I'll make money through Satisfy!\" He grinned. \"You know I'm a blacksmith in-game, right? It's a legitimate profession. I can sell items for serious prices. With some luck, I could earn CEO-level income. A top merchant already promised to support me.\"\n\nThe silence returned, heavier than before.\n\nHis father's voice dropped to a dangerous register. \"...So you want to stay home and play video games.\"\n\n*What? Why is he angry?*\n\n\"It makes sense! The more I play, the more I earn. I might even live in the capsule full-time.\" Youngwoo forced a laugh. \"Pretty smart, right?\"\n\n*Ttaak!*\n\n\"Gah!\"\n\nThe spoon struck his forehead. His mother calmly handed his father a fresh one. The second spoon found its mark with equal precision.\n\n\"Ow! What the hell? Why?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, you go to the labor office.\"\n\n\"What? Didn't you hear what I said? I'll make money through the game!\"\n\nHis mother wiped tears from her cheeks. \"Goodness. He's really lost it. Sehee, promise me you won't end up like this.\"\n\n*What is she even saying?*\n\nSehee bit her lip, trembling with anger. \"Grow up! You're going to make money from a game? You've been playing for a year! And your debt only got worse! Face reality!\"\n\n\"It's different now. I'm a blacksmith. Things have changed. I've built connections, and the best merchant is going to help me—\"\n\n\"Stop talking about the game! It's not real!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nHe tried explaining further. The details. The opportunities. The proof.\n\nNo one listened.\n\nAs chaos unfolded around him—his mother weeping, his father glowering, Sehee fuming—Youngwoo realized the truth.\n\n*Words won't convince them. I need to show them.*\n\n---\n\nThe next morning arrived too quickly.\n\nHis mother's tears drove him to change clothes and head to the construction site. As he swung a sledgehammer under the merciless sun, he formulated his plan.\n\n*Leveling. Completing the class quest. But most important—making money.*\n\nThe first step was clear.\n\n*Accept Rabbit's proposal.*\n\nHe didn't know the specifics of how Rabbit would help him profit, but the man's position spoke for itself. Second-in-command at the Mero Company meant competence. Trust was warranted.\n\n*If I use Khan's smithy as my base, operations will be smooth. I need more time in-game, but first... I need to earn enough that my parents will eat their words.*\n\nSatisfy news dominated every TV channel, every website. His parents had surely seen the stories—people becoming famous, wealthy, successful through the game. Yet they refused to believe their own son could achieve the same.\n\nAs Sehee had pointed out, he'd spent a year. No. *A year and a month.*\n\n*Their skepticism is reasonable. I've given them no reason to believe. Words are worthless now. I need proof.*\n\nThat evening, Youngwoo ignored his exhaustion and connected to Satisfy.\n\nHe made straight for Khan's smithy.\n\n\"Ohh, welcome, Grid!\"\n\nKhan's face radiated warmth. More than that, the old blacksmith seemed... lighter. Younger, almost.\n\nYoungwoo glanced around. The residents he passed no longer wore expressions of tight-lipped anxiety. The atmosphere had shifted entirely.\n\n*Winston's at peace. Euphemina and Rabbit must have handled everything.*\n\nHe turned to Khan. \"Has Rabbit been here?\"\n\nThe brightness faded from Khan's features. \"Ah... this letter arrived for you.\"\n\nThe envelope was crisp, expensive paper. Youngwoo unfolded the contents.\n\n---\n\n> **Mr. Grid,**\n>\n> This is Rabbit. Earl Steim could not excuse the sins I committed against the people of Winston during my tenure with the Mero Company. A full pardon was denied. Our business arrangement must be cancelled.\n>\n> Mr. Grid, your talents will make you the wealthiest craftsman through your own merits. Please seek Khan's counsel. His artistic sensibilities will prove invaluable to your work.\n>\n> I will observe your legend from afar and pray sincerely for your success.\n>\n> — Rabbit\n\n---\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nYoungwoo read it again.\n\n*What the hell is this?*\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms:**\nOG: Glossary Link\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to unedited chapters and to help achieve goals for extra chapters.
