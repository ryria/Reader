  "content": "Every player in Satisfy—all two billion of them—carried the same indelible memory: Grid's raw, overwhelming power. Not his technique. Not his gear. His *attack damage*. The day that Asian warrior stepped onto the world stage had burned itself into collective consciousness. Great demons fell before him. Tournament champions crumbled. His damage output became the benchmark by which all others measured themselves.\n\nNow, facing down the orc lord Teruchan...\n\n\"I! Guruk! Want to! Win!\"\n\nThe orc stood firm against sword techniques that made great demons flinch. His body bled from a dozen wounds, yet his feet remained planted. No surrender. No retreat. A hundred thousand elite warriors waited at his command, yet he demanded this duel remain one-on-one to the bitter end.\n\nFoolish? Perhaps.\n\nStupid? Maybe.\n\nBut nobody mocked him. His rigid adherence to honor commanded respect.\n\nGrid summoned a blue dragon—breaking news identified it as one of the Four Sacred Creatures from the East Continent. Teruchan roared his challenge. Grid descended from the sky.\n\nThen everything changed.\n\nGone was the juggernaut who crushed opponents through overwhelming offense and impenetrable defense. Grid *moved*. Light. Fast. Footwork that flowed seamlessly between sword dance forms. His lower body drove every technique with unusual mastery.\n\n\"Guruk...!\"\n\nGrid's leg intercepted Teruchan's broadsword. Already Grid had closed the distance—an arrow loosed from its string.\n\n*Kick. Chase. Strike. Retreat.*\n\nThe God Hands orbited him like satellites, multiplying his lethality. For Teruchan, it became hell itself. Grid fought *well*—the kind of technical brilliance that made viewers forget his early struggles. Teruchan had charm, certainly, but Grid commanded something deeper: absolute dominance.\n\n> Holy shit! Get closer!\n\nThe chat erupted in frustration. Grid and Teruchan moved too fast for cameras to track. Each collision sent shockwaves that rattled or destroyed recording equipment. Broadcasters pulled back, sacrificing detail for stability.\n\nThe combatants shrank to distant dots. Tactical overview improved, but expressions vanished. Breathing disappeared. The visceral intensity bled away.\n\n> Cameramen are useless. If shaking's the problem, get close and record with your EYES. Tsk.\n\n> Streamers died trying that, genius.\n\n> Risk = reward. Get the shot, hit the jackpot.\n\n> 99.9% of the ones trying get blocked by orcs or blown up.\n\n> Just zoom in post-production. Look here.\n\nS.A. Group contracted with broadcasters—major networks and independents alike—providing specialized equipment. Drone cameras predominated: undetectable to NPCs, fast, efficient. But small size meant vulnerability. In extreme conditions like this battlefield, their functions failed.\n\nThat's why popular streamers like Bunny Bunny rushed to the frontlines. Broadcasting directly through their own eyes delivered realism and solid intel that drones couldn't match. Choosing assassin classes helped them get dangerously close.\n\n> Uh...?\n\nThe disgruntled audience fell silent.\n\nWhite lightning consumed Grid. Not from Fly. Since he'd risen into the sky through different means—something beyond normal flight—electrical currents had spiraled around him. Now they burned *pure white*.\n\nAn absurd optical illusion: Grid himself *was* lightning.\n\n──!\n\n『...!?』\n\nWorldwide, the internet stopped. Community posts froze mid-update. Chat windows locked. Even professional commentators went mute.\n\n*CRACK.*\n\nGrid vanished in a flash. Teruchan's defense crumbled. Thunder rolled across the battlefield. Blood fountained from the orc's chest.\n\n\"Keok...! Cough!\"\n\nThe mountain of an orc swayed. Experts stammered explanations—\"exceeded maximum player speed\"—as their eyes lost track despite desperate focus.\n\n\"I...! Warrior! Guruk! I'm a warrior before I'm a lord! Kurruk! I! Fight!\"\n\nHis grip on the broadsword never slackened. Teruchan bellowed and carved wild arcs through empty air. Then—*there*—he twisted and launched a spinning kick. Grid's lightning speed was illusion, not reality. Perception fooled the eye.\n\n> **Lightning God Lv. 1**\n>\n> *Conditional Passive.*\n>\n> *Assimilate with the Blue Dragon's Breath.*\n>\n> *Once maximum speed is reached, low chance to transform body into lightning. All attacks convert to lightning element. Each hit burns massive mana (10% total).*\n>\n> *Immune to physical attacks, but magic damage doubles (ignores defense and resistance). Movement path leaves electrical current dealing 10x damage. Current duration: 2 seconds.*\n>\n> *Remains active until speed drops. Deactivates immediately upon deviation from maximum velocity.*\n>\n> *** If death occurs during Lightning God activation, Blue Dragon's Wrath triggers.**\n>\n> *** Skills attached to myth-rated items can be upgraded.**\n\nLightning God provided no speed buffs. The deception came from visual effects—brilliant light and explosive thunder convincing observers that Grid moved at lightning velocity. Teruchan and the audience fell for the trick.\n\nBut only for a moment.\n\nTeruchan pierced the illusion. His counterattack exploded. The incandescent Grid took broadsword slashes, repeated stabs—\n\n> Wow.\n\n> Is this dangerous?\n\nFrozen chat windows exploded with activity. Years of watching Grid had built attachment. Teruchan, for all his charm, remained a stranger. An NPC. Few wanted Grid to lose.\n\n> Yeah, Grid's dead.\n\n> About time.\n\nNot everyone, though. Some nursed jealousy. Those few smiled.\n\n> ....??\n\nThe smiles died fast. Teruchan's broadsword carved through Grid again and again—yet no blood spilled.\n\n\"Guruk?\"\n\nIllusion? Magic? Teruchan's confusion mounted as his blade found only air. He swung faster, more desperately. Grid remained untouchable—the moon's reflection in water.\n\n\"Kung! Kung kung!\"\n\nSnorting, Teruchan hunted for Grid's true body through the storm of afterimages.\n\n\"...!\"\n\nA chill locked his spine. The scent from the illusion was *real*.\n\nNot illusion. *Reality.*\n\n\"100,000 Army.\"\n\nLightning God nullified physical attacks. Grid triggered Item Combination—cooldown elapsed during Teruchan's fruitless assault—merging Belial's Staff and Enlightenment Sword once more.\n\n\"Massacre Sword.\"\n\nMadra's technique. The Undefeated King's legacy. Thirty slashes amplified by lightning crashed down. Timeless. Simultaneous. As though thirty master swordsmen struck as one. The 100,000 Army Swordsmanship embodied mysteries that even Teruchan—devotee of pure physical might—couldn't fathom.\n\n\"Amazing!\"\n\nPure admiration flooded him. Defense, not offense. He activated a skin-hardening skill—\n\n\"...!?\"\n\nNothing. Lightning Incarnation had burned away his mana during the previous exchange.\n\nTeruchan destroyed exactly eight slashes. Eight out of thirty. Through physical strength alone, no skills whatsoever—neutralizing the Undefeated King's technique with basic attacks. Grid acknowledged his opponent's greatness.\n\n**Name:** Grid  \n**Level:** 403  \n**Health:** 152,540 **Mana:** 41,844 **Sword Energy:** 1,200  \n**Strength:** 3,590 (+480) **Stamina:** 2,197 (+800)  \n**Agility:** 3,190 (+430) **Intelligence:** 2,657 (+830)  \n**Dexterity:** 5,167 (+980) **Persistence:** 1,632 (+430)  \n**Composure:** 1,188 (+430) **Indomitable:** 1,423 (+540)  \n**Dignity:** 2,096 (+430) **Insight:** 1,986 (+430)  \n**Courage:** 1,242 (+430) **Political Power:** 181 (+430)  \n**Demonic Power:** 31,590  \n**Good Luck:** 631  \n**Deity:** 7  \n**Remaining Stat Points:** 590\n\nGrid's total strength exceeded 4,000, boosted by title effects. His strength coefficient had scaled higher past level 400. Fighting energy accumulation and courage stat bonuses amplified his damage. The Enlightenment Sword's +4 enhancement added more.\n\nConclusion: Grid's damage matched a high-tier field boss. With legendary skills factored in, he surpassed most boss monsters.\n\nYet Teruchan competed—no skills, only an old broadsword. The system calibrated him as the peak specimen of his species. His raw physical ability eclipsed Grid's. Blocking the technique with basic attacks wasn't impossible. Just improbable.\n\n\"I like you more and more.\"\n\nTeruchan stood at his limit. His breathing came ragged after weathering 100,000 Army Massacre Sword. The fight neared its end.\n\n> [The duration of **Blackening** is over.]  \n> [All stats will return to normal figures.]  \n> [Maximum speed has fallen. **Lightning God** has been released.]\n\nDemonic energy dispersed. Lightning faded. Grid reverted to his original form—sweaty, blood-streaked, pushing back soaked hair. A handsome forehead emerged. Sharp eyes blazed.\n\n*'Grid should've fought the Demon King Subjugation in his true form. Would've made him look like an even darker great demon.'*\n\nA famous Hollywood actress wrote that on social media. Rumor claimed a billion likes sent her to the hospital from happiness—but that wasn't important. What mattered was...\n\n\"A warrior's spirit...!\"\n\nGrid's ferocious appearance resonated with Teruchan.\n\n> [The title **'Pangea's Duke of Virtue'** is activated!]\n\n\"...??\"\n\nA title that triggered with low probability to spare monsters during hunts. Meaning the target had to be near death. So why activate *now?* Grid startled—then noticed.\n\nTeruchan had fainted, eyes still wide open. Despite whatever Grid tried, the orc's remaining health drained away—two-tenths vanishing fast.\n\n\"Look at me! Open your eyes! Don't die!\"\n\n> ...Just let him go.\n\n> Grid found a new hobby.\n\n> Beat him half to death, then refuse to let him die?\n\nViewers clicked their tongues as Grid clutched and shook the dying orc lord."
