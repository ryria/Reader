Thirty minutes before the match, both men wrestled with the same question.\n\n*Can I win?*\n\n*I must win.*\n\n*If not now—*\n\n*There might never be another chance.*\n\nTheir last encounter at the National Competition had carved itself into memory. They'd seen through each other—recognized what the other was capable of. That recognition bred both respect and fear. Neither could fully measure the other's ceiling, and that uncertainty gnawed at them.\n\n## Korean Team's Waiting Room\n\nGrid's pulse hammered against his ribs as he sat on the sofa, faster than he could remember it beating in years. His mind drifted back to their first meeting—the day he'd faced the man called the sky above the sky, a legend who seemed untouchable.\n\nA slow exhale.\n\n*This feeling...*\n\nHow could he even name it? Kraugel had changed him. That single encounter had launched Grid into the world's consciousness, forced him to confront his own potential, gifted him with confidence he'd never possessed before. More than that, Kraugel had given him a target—something to chase.\n\n*Without you, I'd still be nothing.*\n\nIn a way, Kraugel was Grid's benefactor. The man who'd shared information about the Behen Archipelago when he had no reason to. The catalyst for everything Grid had become.\n\nA smile tugged at Grid's lips as he rose from the sofa.\n\n\"Kraugel... you're obligated to watch what I've become.\"\n\nThe desire to win crashed through him like a physical force. He clenched his fists, feeling the tremor in his fingers.\n\nHe understood now. His days of chasing were ending. He would be the one others pursued—for South Korea's rising players, for the Overgeared Kingdom, for everyone who'd believed in him. To do that, he had to break through the ceiling called Kraugel.\n\n*The role you've carried... let me shoulder it from now on.*\n\nGrid raised his shaking hands to his face, steadying his breathing.\n\n***\n\nOutside the waiting room, the other Korean representatives maintained their distance, unwilling to disturb Grid's focus.\n\n\"So who actually wins this?\" Viola asked, unbothered by the tension.\n\n\"God Grid. Obviously.\" Peak Sword's response came without hesitation.\n\nSilence answered him.\n\nThe rematch between Grid and Kraugel—one year and three months in the making. More than personal pride hung in the balance. South Korea versus the United States. First place in the overall rankings. The winning nation's players would receive a substantial experience buff.\n\nEvery Korean player prayed for Grid's victory. The problem? His opponent was the sky above the sky. The man who'd reigned supreme since Satisfy's launch. Grid's strength was undeniable, but could anyone truly defeat Kraugel?\n\n\"We'll know by the end of the day,\" Eat Spicy Jokbal said. \"Sure, Sword Saint Kraugel's power is nearly impossible to quantify, but Grid hasn't shown all his cards either. It could go either way.\"\n\nThe Sword Saint's title as the strongest combat class was difficult to contest. But Grid possessed superior items and a higher level than Kraugel.\n\n\"...Well, I'm personally rooting for Grid.\"\n\nEat Spicy Jokbal's reasons went beyond wanting the buff. If Grid—the man who'd defeated *him*—lost to Kraugel?\n\n*That means I'm still under Kraugel. Damn it!*\n\nHe refused to be beneath anyone.\n\nPeak Sword laughed, oblivious to Eat Spicy Jokbal's internal crisis. \"You're hoping for Grid's victory? Friend Jokbal! You've finally fallen for God Grid's charms!\"\n\n\"What bullshit—! I just want the buff!\"\n\nTwenty minutes until the finals.\n\n***\n\n## US Team's Waiting Room\n\nKraugel sat motionless, eyes closed.\n\nHis mind wandered through memories. Meeting the mad Agnus for the first time. The single day he'd spent with Haster, who cared for nothing in the world. The moment he'd first seen Grid—flames burning in those black eyes.\n\nAmong the Five Miracles that S.A. Group monitored, Grid was the one who set Kraugel's blood on fire. Their first encounter came right after Grid had fought Piaro. And despite everything, Grid had been the first player to defeat him.\n\n*Since then...*\n\nKraugel's attention had never strayed far from Grid. Every time he witnessed Grid push past another limit, Kraugel's motivation intensified. He grew faster. He realized something crucial: without Grid, Kraugel might have maintained his position, but the emptiness would have consumed him. The curse of having no rivals.\n\n*Because of him, I've been happy.*\n\nA smile crossed Kraugel's face as his eyes opened. The moment he stood—\n\n\"Player Kraugel, fifteen minutes until the match starts. Please proceed to the stage.\"\n\nThe staff's voice carried through the door.\n\nLauel met his gaze. \"Good luck.\"\n\nThe words carried complicated weight. Lauel wanted Grid to win—naturally, as Grid's subordinate. He prayed for it. But Kraugel was the peak of two billion users, an idol to countless millions. His fall would send ripples through the entire community.\n\nKraugel read the bittersweet expression on Lauel's face and responded with his characteristic blank look.\n\n\"My opponent is Grid. If I lose to him, no one can deny what he's become.\"\n\nGrid had earned the right to challenge the sky. The world knew it now. If Kraugel lost, no one would criticize or feel disappointed.\n\n\"Of course, I don't plan on losing.\"\n\nVictory. He would claim it again. The desire burned in Kraugel's chest. He wanted to remain Grid's goal. He needed Grid to stay conscious of him, always. Nothing was sadder than one-sided admiration.\n\n***\n\n\"Crying Tiger.\"\n\n*WHOOOOM!*\n\nThe massive screen displayed the PvP finals from the 2nd National Competition. Kraugel pierced through white-haired Grid's shield, flames engulfing him as he struck. The winner decided by 0.1 seconds. The footage that had moved billions.\n\n\"Ahh...\"\n\n\"That scene never gets old.\"\n\nFive billion views in a year. Of the world's eight billion people, only infants hadn't witnessed the confrontation between Grid and Kraugel. And no one watched it just once. Children, young people planning their futures, middle-aged workers exhausted by life, elderly in their twilight years—\n\nAll of them drew new dreams from that video. They lived faithfully, hoping to one day stand on that same stage.\n\nThe players who became idols.\n\nGrid and Kraugel entered the arena.\n\n『 **The protagonists of the legendary battle from one year and three months ago! Kraugel of the United States and Grid of South Korea take the stage!!** 』\n\n『 **Listen to those cheers! In fifteen years of commentary, I've never witnessed anything like this. Tokyo Dome might actually collapse!** 』\n\n『 **Hahaha! In this moment, everyone's united—nationality, race, gender, religion, none of it matters. This is the power these two players hold.** 』\n\n『 **No one's even thinking about the overall rankings anymore. Everyone's just passionate about watching these two competitors.** 』\n\n\"GRID! FIRST LEGEND! FIRST KING! PROVE YOU'RE THE BEST!\"\n\n\"KRAUGEL! DON'T FALL! SHOW GRID WHY YOU'VE REIGNED FOR YEARS!\"\n\n\"GRID!\"\n\n\"KRAUGEL!\"\n\n\"WAAAHHHHHH!\"\n\nThe roar spread throughout Tokyo, transmitted to viewers worldwide. Yet Grid and Kraugel existed in their own tranquil world. They faced each other, awareness narrowed to a single point. The crowd's cries couldn't reach them.\n\n\"A man's match should be decided in three rounds, right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then this determines the real winner?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"We'll still be friends regardless of the result?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Then I'll beat you.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best too.\"\n\nA brief exchange. They moved toward their capsules. The host hurried over, thrusting a microphone toward Kraugel.\n\n\"Could you share your feelings before the match?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nTokyo Dome fell silent. Tens of thousands of eyes focused on one man. Faces filled with anticipation as Kraugel opened his mouth.\n\n\"I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"...Huh?\"\n\nThe sky above the sky was *afraid*? The host and spectators doubted their ears.\n\n\"That's why I'm looking forward to it even more.\"\n\nThen Kraugel smiled. The eternally expressionless Kraugel, smiling so brightly?\n\n\"Ahh...\"\n\nThe crowd understood in that instant. The person who'd waited for this moment most desperately was Kraugel himself.\n\n\"KYAAAAK! KRAUGEL!\"\n\n\"YES! ENJOY IT! KRAUGEL, WIN!\"\n\n\"KRAUGEL! KRAUGEL! KRAUGEL!\"\n\n\"WAAAAAAHHHHH!\"\n\nThe atmosphere reached fever pitch.\n\n## Simultaneously, in Satisfy\n\n\"We move soon.\"\n\nVeradin led Immortal's elite forces into Reinhardt, capital of the Overgeared Kingdom. Infiltration proved effortless—the Overgeared Kingdom allowed players free access to the city.\n\n\"Head straight for the smithy.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\nGrid's overwhelming National Competition performance combined with recruiting Panmir, the first-ranked blacksmith, had forced Immortal to feel the pressure. As Grid's enemies, they couldn't overlook the Overgeared Kingdom's rise.\n\nSo they acted.\n\n\"Target: Blacksmith Khan. Find him and eliminate him.\"\n\nImmortal struck first. Most Overgeared members were logged out for the PvP finals. Reinhardt stood undefended.\n\n***\n\n\"The stars are beautiful tonight.\"\n\nKhan's hammer fell in steady rhythm, each strike meant to give Grid strength. He worked with that intention always in his heart. His weathered face turned upward, eyes filled with longing as he gazed at the night sky.\n\nTonight, he wanted to see Grid more than ever."
