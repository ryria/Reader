This was a sight Limit had never imagined in his lifetime.\n\n*Flap.*\n\nIn a moment of desperation, Grid unfurled the fabric. The explosion of light that should have consumed both Grid and Limit was sucked into the cloth's surface.\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nSilence descended. From Limit, who had maintained his grim expression since first appearing, to Biplonz observing from the shadows, to Ke who'd been dozing from boredom, to the dukes and nameless prisoners scattered throughout the dungeon—everyone in the Abyss lost their composure.\n\nSuch was the legacy of the legendary tailor.\n\n**[Mysterious Cloth]**\n\n**Rating: Legendary**  \n**Durability: None**\n\n**A four-dimensional cloth that neutralizes explosion-type damage.**  \n**When unfolded at the point of detonation, all explosive energy is absorbed into the fabric.**\n\n**Skill Cooldown: 10 minutes**\n\n\"...An explosion fueled by Origin True Energy.\" Limit's voice carried genuine shock. \"It possessed enough power to obliterate even the palace gates, despite all their protective enchantments. Yet you blocked it?\"\n\nHis gaze fixed on the cloth Grid was folding away. \"What manner of artifact is that? A dragon's treasure?\"\n\n\"You don't need to know,\" Grid replied coldly, recovering the cloth without ceremony. He had no intention of satisfying the man's curiosity.\n\n*Thump. Thump.*\n\nGrid maintained his outward composure, but his heart hammered against his ribs. In the darkness of the Abyss, his fingertips trembled. He was still reeling. If he'd been even a tenth of a second slower, he would be dead. Coke would have died. He would have failed to rescue the dukes.\n\nIt would have been catastrophic.\n\n'I need more talents like this.'\n\nGrid possessed a surprisingly modest side when it came to natural ability. Talent—that was something no amount of effort could manufacture. He understood this bitter truth because he knew geniuses. Kraugel was the perfect example. Grid recognized the countless ways Kraugel surpassed him, and he accepted it humbly. He admired and envied the man in equal measure.\n\nBut there was one area—just one—where Grid allowed himself pride. His item swap speed exceeded even Kraugel's. It was a natural result. He'd overcome more crises and wielded more items than anyone else. Of two billion players, Grid swapped equipment more frequently than any other. That speed had been tempered in the crucible of desperation. The velocity at which he identified, selected, and equipped items from his inventory was unmatched—even Kraugel couldn't surpass him.\n\n'Heh...'\n\nHe was the only person in the world who could have survived this situation. If Kraugel faced the same circumstances, he'd die before managing to deploy the Mysterious Cloth.\n\nGrid savored the moment of pride, then immediately fell into self-reflection. That the only thing he could be proud of was his equipment swap speed... wasn't he thinking too modestly?\n\nHe clicked his tongue and leveled his sword at Limit once more.\n\nBoth Grid and Limit knew—this protracted battle was approaching its end. Limit struggled to raise his sword after depleting his Origin True Energy. His lips parted, pale as bone.\n\n\"You're looking at me like you want to devour me. Yes... people like you will never understand me.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"I was born destined to be the greatest, and I worked my entire life toward that goal. But I had no talent.\" Limit's voice grew hollow. \"I lived in the shadow of the genius Piaro, treated as my family's disgrace.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"I won't forget my father's dying gaze—not even on my deathbed.\"\n\nThose eyes had been filled with disappointment and resentment, yet they'd pierced Limit's chest like a dagger.\n\n\"I wanted to be the best. I wanted to serve the Empire and the Emperor with loyalty, to share camaraderie with my comrades—all after achieving greatness.\"\n\nThings had progressed too far for postponement. Limit simply wanted to extract the beast lodged in his chest. He'd become an unfaithful traitor, an ignorant villain. It was irreversible. In the end, he'd been forced to take the Empress's hand.\n\n\"If only I'd been born a genius who understood reason, rather than a criminal who'd lost his way... If I...\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nLimit was undoubtedly an important figure in the Empire. He surely had his own story. But as Grid listened, his frown deepened. Something about these words rang false. *A criminal who'd lost his way*...? Just hearing the phrase put him in a foul mood.\n\n\"I don't know what you're trying to say. Stop with the sophistry.\" Grid's voice hardened. \"Even a fool knows not to betray his comrades. They don't stab people in the back. You pushed Piaro and Asmophel into the abyss of despair. You wounded three dukes. You are corrupted in mind and spirit.\"\n\n\"...!\" \n\nLimit's dimmed eyes suddenly widened. Realization struck. Everything was an excuse. Yes—he was simply a twisted human being. It was petty jealousy alone that made him deceive the royal family, that drove him to destroy Piaro and Asmophel's lives. His expectations, his disappointments, his resentments—none of it absolved him.\n\nLimit returned his sword to its sheath. Empty-handed, he spoke in a desolate tone: \"Kill me as painfully as possible. I don't deserve rest.\" He paused. \"Additionally... if you ever get the chance, tell Piaro and Asmophel—I am sorry.\"\n\nHis gaze shifted to the prison behind Grid. This apology extended to them as well. To the dukes.\n\nGrid was genuinely surprised. Limit's eyes, once self-righteous and arrogant, now resembled Sticks' gaze—deep and clear. That a man like Limit would accept death willingly... this was a development Grid never anticipated. He wondered briefly if the Yatan Essence had affected Limit's mind, but the truth remained unknown.\n\n\"...Overgeared King.\" Grenhal's voice echoed from behind. \"Your Majesty, please finish him. If he survives and faces the Emperor's judgment, he won't die alone. His entire family will be exterminated.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid didn't need to ask which option was better. Grenhal had suffered lifelong anguish over his failure to protect Piaro's family. Grid opposed Limit, but he wouldn't repeat that history of suffering.\n\n\"I intended to do so regardless,\" Grid said, keeping his tone casual. \"I have to repay my knights' enemies.\"\n\nHis mind felt heavy. Originally, he should have cut Limit's throat with a light heart, but the conversation had poisoned that simplicity.\n\nGrid drew a deep breath and slowly approached Limit. It was the precursor to a sword dance. Facing the technique, Limit seemed to hear music.\n\nThe ground around Grid began fracturing. Transcendent energy—the kind found only in myths—stirred the earth and atmosphere. Some of the swirling air currents sharpened and formed a vortex. Braham's Wind Cutter manifested. The black-gold sword began glowing white as Weapon Enchant attached itself to Pinnacle. The killing intent was so overwhelming it numbed the skin of everyone present.\n\n\"Transcended Linked Kill Pinnacle.\"\n\nThe fifth sword dance Grid had fused together. His ultimate single-target destructive technique—surpassing even Linked Kill Flower Pinnacle—cleaved toward Limit. \n\nIt was a courtesy to Limit, not the 'Sword Duke.' Grid released it for the first time as respect for an opponent who'd at least acknowledged his ability.\n\nHe was grateful for that much.\n\n\"...\"\n\nLimit, who had been suffering since the beginning, was liberated from his pain. His death came instantaneous and calm. The Empire's greatest swordsman turned to ash.\n\nA single player had defeated the Sword Duke.\n\n\"What?\" Resh couldn't form words. This death felt surreal after experiencing Limit's strength firsthand mere moments ago.\n\nMeanwhile, Coke formed two tight fists and accepted reality. \"As expected of Grid... I knew he could do it.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*He knew Grid could do it?* He believed one player would defeat one of the Empire's strongest NPCs? Resh remained frankly unconvinced. This felt like a dream.\n\nBut it wasn't.\n\n**[The Saharan Empire's duke 'Sword Duke Limit' has been defeated.]**\n\n**[It is a great accomplishment that no one has achieved.]**\n\n**[Your reputation throughout the continent has increased. You have acquired 3,000 reputation points.]**\n\n**[The level of party leader 'Grid' has risen!]**\n\n**[The '?' of party leader 'Grid' has risen! It is a concept you don't understand yet.]**\n\n**[Party leader 'Grid' has acquired the Star Sword.]**\n\n**[Party leader 'Grid' has achieved 'First Step in Revenge.']**\n\n**[An unknown person has achieved level 400 for the first time.]**\n\nThe world message appeared after several notification windows. Resh could finally accept reality.\n\n*'The best...!'*\n\nHis eyes trembled as he gazed at Grid. A strange sensation washed over him. What kind of world was Grid looking at? Resh found himself desperately curious.\n\n***\n\n**[Your status has risen after struggling with the strong. Your skin feels somewhat harder.]**\n\n**[The increase in status has created the passive skill 'Skin of Transcendence.']**\n\n**[Congratulations! You are the first player to reach level 400!]**\n\n**[You have taken the title 'Pioneer' from someone unknown!]**\n\n**[Pioneer]**\n\n**A 10% increase in character experience acquisition.**  \n**10% increase in rewards for discovering new places.**  \n**Access to the Tower of Wisdom.**\n\n***This title can only be held by the foremost person. Keep in mind it can be taken by others at any time.***\n\n'Ah.'\n\nAfter reading the Pioneer title's description, Grid understood. This had belonged to Kraugel.\n\n'...This is huge.'\n\nDespite feeling slightly regretful...\n\n'He's been enjoying this benefit since the game started?'\n\nIt was both scandalous and thrilling. The notification windows continued updating.\n\n**[You have reached level 400 and achieved the fourth stats awakening!]**\n\n**[For every point of stamina, health will increase by 30 and defense will increase by 1.2.]**\n\n**[For every point of strength, health will increase by 9 and attack will increase by 0.8.]**\n\n**[For every point of intelligence...]**\n\n......\n\n......\n\n**[One of Pagma's Descendant's hidden pieces, 'Sealed Ability,' has been acquired.]**\n\n**[The effect of the skill 'Mineral Creation' will change.]**\n\n**[Mineral Creation]**\n\n**Create new minerals by mixing multiple minerals. You can now select pavranium as a mineral to mix.**\n\n**Pavranium itself embodies a great magician's accumulated knowledge, allowing you to create entirely new minerals.**\n\n**Time required to create minerals: Immediate**  \n**Materials needed: Five types of minerals, including pavranium**  \n**Number of uses: 1**\n\n***The weight of the created mineral matches your current pavranium weight.***  \n***After creating a new mineral, you can improve it more effectively with a great magician's assistance.***\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nItem Combination was the skill Grid gained at level 300. He hadn't known what ability awaited him this time, but this exceeded his wildest imagination.\n\n\"Haha!\"\n\nThree years? No—was it four? After reaching level 300, Grid had taken an extraordinarily long time to reach 400. As he smiled brightly, moved beyond words—\n\n**[The duration of Item Combination is over.]**\n\nThe weapons separated. As Iyarugt began returning to his original position, his soul whispered:\n\n—*You should beware of him.*\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n—*That demonkin. I don't know for certain, but I smell something. By the way, how much longer must I stay with Peak Sword...*\n\nIyarugt's words cut off abruptly. An irresistible force pulled him back.\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nBased on the tone, Iyarugt seemed to have developed a decent relationship with Peak Sword. Grid turned toward Biplonz, still leaning against the stone wall with crossed arms. Hell's greatest demonic beast feared him, and Sword Demon Iyarugt warned against him.\n\n'But he doesn't seem malicious. I'll keep watch.'\n\nThe immediate problem wasn't Biplonz—it was the three dukes. He was also curious about the other prisoners, but they needed to leave quickly before Edan discovered Limit's death.\n\n\"Biplonz, I'll return another time. Please stay safe until then. I'll leave these keys with you just in case.\"\n\n\"I'm embarrassed, but thank you.\"\n\nGrid exchanged brief farewells and escaped the Abyss with the dukes and Ke. Resh had already secured a prisoner list, so the quest was complete.\n\n***\n\nSimultaneously, in the Celestial Palace, Grandmaster Zikfrector set aside the magic crystal ball he'd been observing for hours.\n\n\"It was interrupted by Limit.\"\n\nHe hadn't expected Grid to triumph over a duke after achieving transcendence.\n\n\"I should have dealt with Limit in advance.\"\n\nNo, no—it was unlikely Grid could break through the hydra, considering how much he'd struggled against Limit.\n\n\"I can only fulfill the promise next time.\"\n\nHe'd waited for hundreds of years. Waiting a bit longer posed no problem. A faint smile appeared on the Grandmaster's face as he turned his gaze out the window.\n\nIt was a smile centuries in the making."
