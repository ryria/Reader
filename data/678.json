Legendary items weren't supposed to look like this.\n\n'Did Pagma actually make this garbage?'\n\nThe thought nagged at him. Every Pagma creation Grid had encountered so far had been... underwhelming. Honestly, Grid's own work often outperformed them. But he'd always rationalized it away—those were early pieces, crafted while Pagma was still developing. The real masterworks would've come later, during his prime.\n\nAnd Pagma's time on the Behen Archipelago? That was his final chapter. His peak years.\n\nYet here Grid stood, holding these gloves—proof that even at his zenith, Pagma produced *this?*\n\n'Did contracting with Baal rot his abilities?'\n\nThe suspicion took root, then withered just as quickly.\n\n\"...Wait. Three times?\"\n\nGrid's eyes locked onto the single option. His jaw went slack—the expression of a man witnessing something that shouldn't exist.\n\n\"Damn...\"\n\nNot double attack speed. *Triple.*\n\n'And it's not even conditional.'\n\nThe Quick Gloves were absurd. A permanent three-hundred-percent increase to attack speed. The expected damage output probably blew the Holy Light Gloves' 5 Joint Attacks out of the water.\n\n\"No, wait.\"\n\nThe fine print clarified: 'normal attacks.' Basic attacks only. The speed boost didn't touch skills—completely different from the Holy Light Gloves, where 5 Joint Attacks could trigger on anything.\n\n\"Before the Enlightenment Blade, I would've been disappointed.\"\n\nMost players built around skills, not basic attacks. Skills hit harder—several times harder. Grid was no exception. He had Pagma's Swordsmanship with legendary-tier damage output, and Failure as his main weapon—which specifically boosted skill damage. Skills were everything. Basic attacks barely registered.\n\nBut the Enlightenment Blade changed the equation. Those Black Flames packed more punch than most active skills, and they triggered on basic attacks. More attacks meant more flames. The Quick Gloves landing in his lap right now?\n\nPure. Luck.\n\n\"Kuhaha...\"\n\nGrid's laugh bubbled up, unstoppable. His knees felt weak. The timing was too perfect—acquiring the Quick Gloves right after forging the Enlightenment Blade, which had the highest basic damage he'd ever created. He felt like the protagonist of reality itself.\n\n\"How am I this lucky...? Oh.\"\n\nGrid froze mid-sentence. He'd never been the type to say things like that. It felt wrong coming out of his mouth.\n\n\"Is this a sign the world's ending?\"\n\nHis joy wrestled with suspicion. He pinched his cheek—hard—several times. Dream logic didn't hold. This was real.\n\n\"...Should probably buy a lottery ticket.\"\n\nGrid turned the thought over seriously, then returned his attention to the gloves, stroking the orange fabric with reverence.\n\n'Even the color's perfect.'\n\nOrange gloves. Anyone with functional taste would recoil. Fortunately, Grid's aesthetic sensibilities existed on a different plane entirely, and he found them beautiful.\n\n'Need to disassemble and rebuild these repeatedly. Get Understanding to one hundred percent, then attempt mass production.'\n\nHe'd already committed to mass-producing Lantier's Cloaks for the Evil Eyes. His production queue kept growing. Grid felt a swell of pride. He tucked the gloves into his inventory and drew out the Magic Engineering weapon.\n\n'Right...'\n\nWould lightning strike twice? Grid shook his head. The Quick Gloves had been too good.\n\n'Can't expect two jackpot drops in a row.'\n\nThat wasn't how loot worked. Most bosses dropped one premium item, maybe. Drop a legendary? Everything else would be Unique rating or lower. Belial had followed the same pattern—one Myth-rated item, period. Though even that wasn't guaranteed. There was always the one-percent chance Grid would hit the bad side of probability.\n\nThe Quick Gloves took the Legendary slot. Logic dictated the magic weapon would be Unique or below. Grid's expectations proved half-right.\n\nOnly half.\n\n[Observing the target item with the Legendary Blacksmith's Eyes.]\n\n[If the item has a hidden feature, it will be found.]\n\n*Ttiring~*\n\n[**Alex's Magic Engineering Bayonet (Produced by Pagma)**]\n\n**Rating:** Unique (Growth)\n\n**Durability:** 599/1,260\n\n**Pistol Mode**\nAttack Power: 870\nMana Purification Rate: +60%\n- Five consecutive hits on the same target: 20% chance to inflict abnormal status.\n\n**Rifle Mode**\nAttack Power: 1,416  \nMana Purification Rate: -15%\nFiring Speed: -20%\n\n**Bayonet Mode**\nAttack Power: 1,067\nStabbing Attack Power: +50%\n- Additional damage scales with combo length.\n- Sword Mastery applicable.\n\n**★ Sniper Mode**\nAttack Power: Instant death.\nAim Time: 10 seconds to 2 minutes (distance dependent)\nCooldown: 1 hour\n\n**Mode conversion limited to once per four seconds.**\n\n*A Magic Engineering bayonet crafted by the Legendary Blacksmith and Baal's Contractor, Pagma.*\n\n*Inspired by Milepeu's work, Pagma created a bayonet capable of transforming into a sniper rifle—an achievement no dwarven craftsman has replicated.

The growth potential didn't.\n\n'...It's an upgraded version of Yura's Magic Engineering gun.'\n\nSeveral times better, actually. Grid's smile widened as fortune smiled on him twice in a row.\n\n'Perfect. I'll give this to Yura.'\n\nHe didn't even consider using it himself. He'd lived the nightmare of raising Growth Type item experience. Once was enough.\n\n***\n\n\"This goddamn Item Experience.\"\n\nVantner glared at his twin axes after their latest Named Boss raid. The Overgeared members offered sympathetic noises.\n\n\"Growth items are brutal. Even grinding constantly, you're looking at two weeks minimum to hit Rare rating. Months for Unique. Years for Legendary.\"\n\nRecently, Growth Type items had become fashionable among top Rankers. Post-level-300 bosses dropped them frequently, and their potential was explosive. It felt like a developer hint—prepare for level-400 content.\n\nOf course, the initial excitement faded quickly. Most growth items dropped at normal rating and performed like wet noodles. Using them as main weapons early on was masochistic.\n\n'Wait... hasn't Grid had Elfin Stone's Ring for a year now?'\n\n\"Over a year. Less for Tiramet's Belt, though.\"\n\n\"Insane...! And neither hit Legendary yet? I can't even imagine the grind required.\"\n\nVantner had spent the past two weeks in grinding hell, trying to raise his twin axes' rating. He'd exclusively hunted durable monsters like golems—level 300 golems—while wielding normal-rating weapons. Pure, distilled suffering. And the experience bar crawled forward at a glacial pace, driving him toward madness. It made Grid's achievements look even more impressive.\n\n\"How does Grid stay so calm about it?\"\n\nIf Vantner owned items stuck at Unique rating, he'd be obsessing over them constantly. Unique was the awkward middle child of ratings. He'd grind day and night for months, single-minded, until they hit Legendary.\n\nBut Grid? Grid never showed the slightest impatience. Elfin Stone's Ring, Tiramet's Belt, Iyarugt, the God Hands—all these growth items, and Grid seemed totally unbothered by their experience requirements.\n\n\"...How is that even possible?\"\n\nThe God Hands especially. The moment those hit Legendary rating, Grid's combat power would explode exponentially. Vantner would be frothing at the mouth, grinding non-stop if he owned them.\n\n\"But Grid doesn't obsess... Is he made of stone?\"\n\nCome to think of it, Grid was stone-like with women too. Some of the world's most beautiful women threw themselves at him, and he just... didn't react. Suspicious. Ibellin voiced what they were all thinking.\n\n\"Maybe... Brother Grid doesn't think?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nActually, yeah. From the perspective of the Overgeared members—all legitimately talented players—Grid's decision-making often baffled them. His priorities seemed inefficient. They constantly wondered what went on in his head.\n\nNo one refuted Ibellin's observation. They all nodded slowly, considering the possibility.\n\n\"You bastards!\" Peak Sword, grinding his own one-handed sword's experience, erupted. \"Don't talk about God Grid like that! This is God Grid! He's too busy to obsess over single items! God Grid isn't ordinary like us! He's a king—the King of South Korea!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Doesn't Lauel do all the actual governing?* Multiple people thought it simultaneously. No one said it out loud.\n\nUltimately, it didn't matter. Whatever Grid's internal logic, whatever his thought process—or lack thereof—the Overgeared members respected and admired him. How could they not? They watched him improve constantly, breaking through limitation after limitation.\n\nThat commanded admiration all on its own."
