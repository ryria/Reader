Each gust carried razors—invisible cuts that burned Grid's exposed skin. Far below, the river churned with deadly force.\n\nDespite the spectacular scenery, Grid knew better than to trust appearances. This place was a graveyard.\n\nHe studied the cave openings pocking the canyon walls, then called up his quest information.\n\n> **[Pagma's Descendant]**\n>\n> Difficulty: Class Quest\n>\n> You have inherited Pagma's blacksmith skills. But do you truly understand who Pagma was? Can you carry out his will?\n>\n> If Pagma were merely a skilled craftsman, his legends wouldn't span the continent. Begin with the clue of swordsmanship that pierced the sky. Follow Pagma's legend. Collect all the fragments, and you will understand him. Succeed his will.\n>\n> A new legend will be born.\n>\n> Class Quest Clear Conditions: Complete all linked quests successfully.\n> Class Quest Clear Reward: Unknown.\n>\n> **First Class Quest: [Pagma's Swordsmanship]**\n>\n> The witness who saw Pagma's swordsmanship 130 years ago has given you a clue. Head to Kesan Canyon, south of Winston. On the northern cliff, you will find Pagma's technique carved in stone.\n>\n> First Class Quest Clear Condition: Learn Pagma's swordsmanship.\n> First Class Quest Clear Reward: <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Dainsleif (Reproduction)</span>\n\nGrid examined the reward's stats. The <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Dainsleif (Reproduction)</span> required level 250 compared to his +8 Ideal Dagger's 180. As a greatsword, it would become his primary weapon—the weapon type he'd specialized in since his warrior days.\n\n*Pagma's swordsmanship. An offensive skill that allegedly pierced the sky.* Grid clenched his fist. *That's exactly what I need.*\n\nHe pressed deeper into the canyon, searching for the north cliff.\n\nA pebble clattered against stone.\n\nGrid's head snapped up. Dust billowed from a cave entrance as compacted dirt crumbled away. A massive shape emerged—sleek scaled muscle and a dinosaur's bulk. Its tongue flickered, blade-sharp and glistening.\n\n*Canyon lizard. Level 162.*\n\nThe logical part of Grid's brain noted that he was stronger now, that his current stats could handle this. But instinct overrode logic. He remembered that tongue punching through his ribcage, remembered dying in this exact spot, to this exact monster.\n\nThe lizard descended the cliff face at impossible speed.\n\n\"Stay back!\" Grid stumbled backward, feet slipping on loose stone. \"Get lost!\"\n\nThe lizard closed the distance. Its tail whipped through the air.\n\nGrid threw himself sideways. The tail obliterated a boulder, reducing it to shrapnel. A chunk of stone caught Grid above the eye. Blood ran hot down his face.\n\n*No escape. Have to fight.* \n\n\"Blacksmith's Rage!\" Power flooded his limbs. \"Wind Blast!\"\n\nThe wind howled toward the lizard like a horizontal cyclone. The creature shrieked as the skill connected.\n\n> [You have dealt 1,230 damage to the target.]\n\nGrid blinked blood from his eyes. Canyon lizards had poor defense—comparable to frostlight orcs—but this damage output was absurd. The +8 enhancement on his dagger had transformed Wind Blast completely.\n\nHis fear burned away. *Just another monster.*\n\n\"Unbreakable Justice!\"\n\n> [You have dealt 12,507 damage to the target.]\n\nThe lizard convulsed. Its tail lashed out from Grid's blind spot.\n\n> [You have suffered 2,019 damage.]\n\nThe impact rattled Grid's skull. Vision blurred. Without Khan's Masterpiece reducing physical damage by 20%, that blow would have been catastrophic.\n\n*Khan, you beautiful bastard.*\n\nThe lizard's tongue shot forward, aimed directly at Grid's heart—the same killing blow from his nightmares.\n\nGrid's teeth clenched. \"Already died to that move once. Not today. Quick Movements!\"\n\nHis agility spiked. The world slowed. Grid slipped past the tongue's trajectory and drove the Ideal Dagger upward through the lizard's jaw.\n\n> [Critical!]\n> [The Ideal Dagger's option effect is activated, instantaneously killing the target.]\n\nThe canyon lizard—Grid's recurring nightmare made flesh—dissolved into grey light.\n\n> [You have defeated a canyon lizard.]\n> [The canyon lizard's tongue has been acquired.]\n> [329,000 experience has been acquired.]\n\nGrid exhaled slowly. A level 85 user had just soloed a level 162 monster.\n\n*This is the power of proper equipment.*\n\nShrieks echoed through the canyon. Three lizardmen emerged from nearby caves, drawn by the sounds of combat.\n\nGrid planted his feet. Running would only trigger a chase. More monsters would swarm. He'd die surrounded.\n\n*I can win.* The thought repeated like a mantra. *I will win.*\n\nQuick Movements carried him past their opening strikes. Blacksmith's Rage burned through his muscles. He downed a mana potion and unleashed Unbreakable Justice.\n\nThe lizardmen raised crude iron shields, absorbing most of the impact. Their formation buckled but held. Grid followed with Wind Blast, shattering their defensive line completely.\n\nHe pressed the opening. The Ideal Dagger flashed blue with each strike.\n\n> [You have dealt 2,600 damage to the target.]\n> [You have dealt 2,830 damage to the target.]\n> [The Best Gauntlets option effect is activated, causing you to attack the target twice.]\n> [You have dealt 5,705 damage to the target.]\n\nDespite their iron armor and scaled hides—defense far exceeding the frostlight orcs—the lizardmen screamed with every blow. By the time Grid's cooldowns reset, all three lay dead at his feet.\n\n> [You have defeated a canyon lizardman.]\n> [You have defeated a canyon lizardman.]\n> [You have defeated a canyon lizardman.]\n> [A damaged sapphire has been acquired.]\n> [<span class=\"rarity-rare\">Crude Scimitar</span> has been acquired.]\n> [316,000 experience has been acquired.]\n> [316,000 experience has been acquired.]\n> [316,000 experience has been acquired.]"
