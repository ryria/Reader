  "content": "# Chapter 173\n\nTalent, skill, beauty, wealth, pedigree. Yura had been born with everything. Nothing was lacking. People assumed she'd never faced hardship, never experienced failure.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nThey didn't know the trials she'd endured, the effort she'd poured into becoming who she was. Yura had failed countless times. She'd tasted frustration until her mouth went bitter with it. But she'd never surrendered to that bitterness, never let it break her.\n\nIt was a process that had unfolded in both reality and Satisfy. It was how she'd clawed her way to 5th on the unified rankings, how she'd become a star that others envied.\n\n*I can learn from this. Even now. Even from death.*\n\nSteel flashed in the sunlight. Blades drove toward her vital organs. She closed her eyes and accepted it.\n\nThen—\n\n*Chaeeeeng!*\n\nSomething fell from the sky.\n\n*What?*\n\nYura's eyes snapped open. Seven golden blades hung in the air, beautiful and deadly. A familiar voice cut through the chaos.\n\n\"The villain has arrived.\"\n\nThe voice was strong, confident. This was the same man who'd sounded so weak just months ago. Would anyone believe that?\n\n*Kwa kwa kwa kwang!*\n\nThe black-haired man swung his greatsword. His strength was overwhelming, undeniable. Grid. The person who'd once frustrated her beyond measure had appeared at her darkest moment.\n\n*You came. You actually came.*\n\nBorn with talent, she'd lived in solitude. She'd never learned to rely on others. After her parents died, the isolation had become total. She'd forged her heart into steel because the world demanded it.\n\nBut now, in this moment, Yura's solid heart melted like snow under sunlight.\n\n\"Thank you.\" The words came out soft.\n\nShe smiled for the first time in memory, felt heat rise in her cheeks. The smile was more radiant than any she'd worn before.\n\n***\n\nTira Island.\n\nThe world's attention had locked onto this small island, the stage for the target processing match.\n\n*A dramatic entrance.*\n\nThat was Turkey's representative Bubat's honest assessment. The young man called Grid had appeared from nowhere, saved Yura from certain death, and blown away multiple rankers in seconds. Then those unidentified golden blades had started destroying targets by themselves.\n\nThe whole thing felt staged, like something from a movie. Right now, the outside world had to be in chaos. The ID \"Grid\" was probably climbing to the top of every country's real-time search rankings.\n\nEveryone in the world had the same question.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Bubat asked on behalf of billions.\n\nGrid's reply dripped with sarcasm. \"Isn't it obvious? I saved Yura. South Korea's representative.\"\n\nBubat's frown deepened.\n\n*No tension despite being surrounded by renowned rankers. Arrogant bastard.*\n\nGrid was clearly a private ranker.\n\n*Another frog in a well who thinks he's king of the pond. I've met plenty like you.*\n\nPrivate rankers all shared one flaw. They didn't understand the reality of the world stage. They mocked the rankers who competed with courage and honor, not realizing their own limitations. Bubat had humbled many such players.\n\n*Stay vigilant.*\n\nHe fixed his gaze on Grid and shifted his stance. Skillful footwork carried him forward, closing the gap to three meters. He activated his skill.\n\n\"Bull Headbutt!\"\n\nBull Headbutt was the Crusher's signature move, a higher concept than Blink magic. It let him leap through space itself, reaching his target regardless of obstacles.\n\n*Kung!*\n\nBubat materialized in front of Grid and struck. His waist bent. His forehead crashed into Grid's face. Yura had countered this exact move with precise timing, but Grid didn't possess Yura's control. The attack landed clean.\n\n> [You have dealt 1,730 damage to the target.]\n\n> [The target will become rigid for 0.3 seconds.]\n\n> [The target has resisted.]\n\n*Resisted?*\n\nConfusion flashed through Bubat, but habit took over. He linked his CC skills.\n\n\"Star Wish!\"\n\n*Kwang!*\n\nHis one-handed hammer slammed into Grid's temple. Stars floated above Grid's head in a special effect display.\n\n> [You have dealt 2,280 damage to the target.]\n\n> [The target will be stunned for 2.5 seconds.]\n\nPerfect execution. This was the power of a Crusher, the class that specialized in neutralizing enemies.\n\n\"Well done, Bubat!\"\n\nThe ten remaining representatives surged forward as one unit. They moved to kill Grid.\n\n*Doesn't matter who you are!*\n\n*I'll make your face twist with pain!*\n\nThey would force Grid to exit, make his spectacular entrance meaningless. He'd crawl back behind his curtain like all private rankers did. The rankers sneered and prepared their attacks.\n\n\"Danger!\" Bubat's shout came urgent, sharp.\n\nAn impossible notification window had appeared before his eyes.\n\n> [The target has resisted.]\n\nHe'd seen plenty of people reduce CC duration through stats, skills, or items. Grid resisting the 0.3-second rigid state hadn't bothered him. But complete immunity to a 2.5-second stun?\n\n*CC immunity?*\n\nIf true, it was a complete cheat. Cold ran down Bubat's spine. But the other rankers were confident. They couldn't imagine Grid possessed CC immunity. They ignored Bubat's warning and swung their weapons with everything they had.\n\n*Pahat!*\n\n*Syuok!*\n\nTheir all-out assault revealed the fatal flaw in their formation. They hadn't expected a counterattack.\n\n*Pisik.*\n\nGrid laughed and moved with casual precision.\n\n*Sukakak!*\n\nHe'd deal with Bubat later.\n\n\"What...?\"\n\nGrid slipped past their attacks and advanced. His counterattack was brutal.\n\n*Seokeok!*\n\n*Puok!*\n\n\"Keook!\"\n\n\"Ugh!\"\n\nGrid's control couldn't match a ranked player's technical skill. But he'd fought powerful bosses. He'd grown beyond the ordinary. That meant he couldn't fail against opponents who'd left themselves wide open.\n\n\"What is this... Ugh!\"\n\nGrid shouldn't have been able to move. He'd dodged cleanly and struck back. The rankers reeled, caught completely off guard. They scrambled for health potions, shock filling their eyes.\n\n> [You have suffered 6,230 damage.]\n\n> [You have suffered 6,100 damage.]\n\n> [You have suffered 6,450 damage.]\n\nSetting aside his CC immunity, his base damage was this high?\n\n\"What the hell is this guy...?\"\n\nA mid-200s damage dealer should inflict around 3,000 damage on a ranker. This was over 6,000. And that was without using a skill?\n\n\"You! What is your identity?\"\n\nGrid was different from typical private rankers. He was a monster like Yura. The South Korean team had hidden another powerhouse of Yura's caliber? Tension rippled through the group. Someone noticed the golden blades destroying targets independently and made a connection.\n\n\"Wait. Those golden blades. Don't they look like the golden discs Pagma's Descendant used at Bairan?\"\n\n\"No way...\"\n\n\"It can't be...\"\n\nThe rankers' faces twisted. At the same moment, commentators worldwide were reaching the same conclusion.\n\n『The seven golden blades are moving autonomously! The actions, material, and color match the golden discs used by Pagma's Descendant!』\n\n『Look at that black greatsword! It has an orange enhancement glow that threw me off at first. But look closer! That's the greatsword Pagma's Descendant threw to Toon at Bairan!』\n\n\"Now that you mention it...\"\n\n\"Then maybe...\"\n\n\"That man called Grid...\"\n\nWas he Pagma's Descendant? Millions of viewers worldwide, the rankers, the live audience, all wondered the same thing. Grid frowned.\n\n*They only lost one-fifth of their health from a direct Dainsleif hit? Top rankers really are different.*\n\n**<span class=\"rarity-rare\">+8 Dainsleif (Reproduction)</span>**\n\n**Rating:** Unique  \n**Durability:** 500/500  \n**Attack Power:** 703~991  \n**Attack Speed:** -8% (-2%)\n\n* Additional damage equal to 10% of the target's current defense will be dealt.\n* The greater the number of enemies, the greater the damage. (Additional 15 (+3) damage per enemy)\n* The skill 'Golden Flash' will be generated.\n\nThe weapon was enhanced to +8. Compared to the base version, attack power had increased by 56% and option effects by 20%.\n\nDainsleif currently perceived eleven enemies. That gave the <span class=\"rarity-rare\">+8 Dainsleif</span> an effective attack power of 901~1,189 plus damage proportional to defense. Strong enough that Grid had judged Failure unnecessary.\n\n*Can't underestimate rankers.*\n\nGrid opened his inventory. He put Dainsleif away and drew Failure.\n\n**<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">+9 Failure</span>**\n\n**Rating:** Legendary  \n**Durability:** 1,090/1,090  \n**Attack Power:** 1,768~3,682  \n**Defense:** 80 (+24)\n\n* Agility +50 (+15)\n* Low probability of blocking enemy attacks.\n* Certain probability of activating '5 Joint Attacks.'\n* High probability of activating 'Cutting.'\n* The skill 'Bisect' will be generated.\n* Fear effect if enemy is more than 20 (-6) levels lower than user.\n* Attack power +20% (+6%) in dark places.\n\nA +9 item existed on a different plane than +8. Compared to base, attack power increased by 70% and options by 30%. And Failure was fundamentally more powerful than Dainsleif. The absolute majesty of <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">+9 Failure</span> couldn't be compared to <span class=\"rarity-rare\">+8 Dainsleif</span>.\n\n*I'm already participating in the National Competition.*\n\nGrid knew concealing his identity was impossible now. So what if the world found out?\n\n*I'll make this debut glamorous.*\n\nBeing a celebrity was annoying in many ways. But if he could endure it, he'd gain significant benefits. He'd become more popular with women. Or he'd become more popular with women.\n\n*I'll become so popular with women!*\n\nAfter Ahyoung, he'd developed a distrust of women. He couldn't think about dating immediately. But he wasn't sworn to celibacy. Who knew what might happen? He might meet his fate if he gained enough female fans.\n\n\"Huhuhu!\"\n\nHe smiled. From the enemy's perspective, Grid's smile looked wicked.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship!\"\n\n\"P-Pagma!\"\n\n\"It's real!\"\n\nThe rankers' minds raced. The legendary class, Pagma's Descendant. The person shaking the entire world was Korean? And what was that white light around the greatsword?\n\n*A +9 weapon!*\n\n\"Transcended Link.\"\n\n*Kwa kwa kwa kwang!*\n\nPagma's Descendant's first appearance since Bairan. This bombardment was far more powerful than what he'd unleashed on Neberius.\n\n> [You have suffered 18,050 damage.]\n\n> [You have suffered 19,900 damage.]\n\n> [You have suffered 18,410 damage.]\n\n\"Kuaaaaak!\"\n\nThe rankers had been hurt fighting Yura. Their health wasn't full despite potions. They couldn't withstand the blue and white bombardment. Bodies began turning to grey light.\n\nA handful who'd deployed defensive skills survived. Only four. Seven rankers logged out from a single skill.\n\n*A wide-area skill with this much damage?*\n\n*Why isn't he affected by CC?*\n\nThe four survivors reeled from the aftermath of the absurd attack. Grid didn't give them time to recover.\n\n\"Quick Movements!\"\n\nHe drew the Ideal Dagger and used its skill. Then he chased the survivors, swapped back to <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">+9 Failure</span>, and activated Blacksmith's Rage. Attack power and attack speed surged. A massive storm raged from the greatsword.\n\n*Jjejeong! Jjang! Jjejejeok!*\n\n> [The durability of Zilron's Sword has decreased by 32.]\n\n> [The durability of Ragel's Shield has decreased by 19.]\n\n> [The durability of Tuhon Armor has decreased by 9.]\n\n*Puk! Peok! Sakak!*\n\n> [You have suffered 9,820 damage.]\n\n> [You have suffered 12,030 damage.]\n\n> [You have suffered 10,550 damage.]\n\n\"Ugh! What is this...?\"\n\n\"Every time I defend, my item durability...!\"\n\n\"This is insane! Kuhak!\"\n\nWas this really a player's damage output? It compared to a boss monster. Yura was strong in magic, but they couldn't endure this bastard's physical power. And his attack speed? Impossibly fast for a greatsword user.\n\n*Seokeok!*\n\n\"Kuaaaaak!\"\n\nFour people couldn't cope with Grid. They counterattacked when possible, but their damage was nothing compared to his. His defense rivaled a tank class. They couldn't deal fatal damage.\n\n\"You!\"\n\nBubat had persistent health. He kept using CC, blocking Grid's path repeatedly. But Grid was immune to crowd control. The Crusher's worst nightmare was Pagma's Descendant.\n\n*How absurd!*\n\nA legendary class was different. Control didn't matter. He was just strong. And the items he wore were too good.\n\n\"This is a fraudulent character... Cough!\"\n\n\"Kuak!\"\n\nThe four survivors, including Bubat, died and logged out.\n\n\"This area is clear.\"\n\nGrid had defeated eleven rankers representing their countries. He drank potions to recover health and scanned the entire island.\n\nOn one side, Regas and Med were locked in confrontation. Natasha ignored Regas, absorbed in targeting. Jishuka and Samuel, Brazil's representatives, were in the forest. The US, French, Chinese, and Japanese representatives kept each other in check.\n\nEveryone who met Grid's eyes flinched. Jishuka and Regas were no exception. Right now, they were Grid's enemies. Silence fell. No one moved carelessly. Grid shrugged.\n\n\"Well, there's no need to fight.\"\n\n*Pepeng! Peng!*\n\nAbove, even now, the seven golden blades moved autonomously, destroying targets. South Korea's points had reached 110. The other teams averaged only 70 points.\n\nMaintain this status quo and South Korea's victory was certain.\n\n『...』\n\nThe commentators were overwhelmed by the legendary class's majesty. Words failed them.\n\nSilence.\n\nThe hundreds of thousands of spectators sat stunned, astonished. The Olympic main stadium was quiet as a tomb.\n\nEven the millions watching via television or internet had lost themselves. Had there ever been such a quiet day since humanity began? Many felt doubt creeping in.\n\n\"You truly are Pagma's Descendant.\"\n\nYura smiled. She was still beautiful despite her wounds. She couldn't raise her slender body. Grid approached.\n\n\"Don't exaggerate. Get up. It's pathetic that someone like you has fallen.\"\n\n\"Please help me.\" Yura held out her hand.\n\n\"Che.\"\n\nGrid clicked his tongue and grabbed her hand. The camera caught it clearly.\n\nThen—\n\n\"W... Waaahhhhhhhh!\"\n\n\"Grid! Grid! Grid!\"\n\n\"Yura! Yura! Yura!\"\n\nThe Korean audience erupted in cheers for the pair. South Korea, a country ignored for being weak in Satisfy. This man and woman were ending that long disgrace.\n\nOn this day, a true legend began."
