  "content": "# Chapter: When Legends Collide\n\nKlaxons shrieked through S.A. Group headquarters as crimson emergency lights strobed across every surface of the production offices. Warning alerts pulsed in mechanical repetition.\n\n> [x:;72ZX987B19 has vanished.]\n\n> [Three major story arcs will be permanently deleted.]\n\n> [188,490 of 390,112 dependent quests can no longer trigger.]\n\n> [Recovery of x:;72ZX987B19 recommended.]\n\n> [CORRECTION.]\n\n> [x:;72ZX987B19's loot acquired by player. Server rollback advised.]\n\n\"What the hell?\"\n\nEntities classified under x:; wielded massive influence over Satisfy's world structure. Only eight Great Demons carried that designation—and precisely five NPCs. Their encounters with players should have been virtually impossible. That's why ancient species received the classification of *secret monsters*. The Giant Cave Cricket was one such x:; entity.\n\nIts existence had anchored an entire narrative thread. The scheduled Dark Elves Episode would have culled ninety percent of the elven population while corrupting the 12 Te. Those noble families, driven to desperation, would have sold their souls to Great Demons and transformed into dark elves. The resulting species diversity would have created fascinating power dynamics during the Great War expansion.\n\nNow that entire storyline had evaporated. Just... gone.\n\nHow could this happen?\n\nThird Production Team Leader Rahul's gaze snapped to the cascading error messages. \"Emergency meeting! *Now!* This is Satisfy's first catastrophic bug! We need containment protocols immediately!\"\n\nHis Korean flowed so flawlessly that his Indian heritage was impossible to detect through speech alone.\n\nThe production floor erupted into controlled chaos as developers scrambled to identify the failure point.\n\n\"It's not a bug.\"\n\nOperations Team Manager Yoon Nahee materialized at Rahul's workstation, manila folders in hand. \"This was caused by two players. The system is functioning exactly as designed.\"\n\n\"Did I suddenly forget how to speak Korean?\"\n\nRahul possessed an IQ north of 180. Learning Korean had been trivial after Satisfy transformed it into a lingua franca of the gaming world. He considered himself fluent. Yet Yoon Nahee's words made absolutely no sense. She might as well have been speaking in tongues.\n\n\"You expect me to believe players encountered an x:; coded monster and successfully *raided* it? That's absurd.\"\n\n\"It's documented fact. Does it make more sense when I mention the Overgeared King and Merchant King were involved?\"\n\n\"Grid and Kir...!\" Rahul's objections died in his throat.\n\n\"Precisely. Here's what happened: Merchant King Kir discovered the World Tree's Forest first. Naturally, he attempted to profit from the elves.\"\n\nKir had temporarily poisoned the World Tree and deceived the elves, then returned to capture them. This disrupted the entire chain of events—the Cave Cricket never got its scheduled elven meal.\n\n\"So it wandered the forest hunting for food... and encountered Grid instead.\"\n\n\"Correct.\"\n\n\"...\" Rahul could no longer deny reality. He knew Grid's capabilities better than almost anyone. The shock of reviewing Grid's character data for the Fourth National Competition's Breaking the Hero event had nearly put him in the hospital. He still felt phantom pains from that fall. Rahul had privately concluded that Breaking the Hero would be unwinnable this year.\n\n*Maybe one of the Five Miracles could manage it. Kraugel possibly, but...* Rahul shook his head.\n\n\"Was Mercedes with him?\"\n\nMercedes' evolution into a Legendary Knight had sent shockwaves through S.A. Group. How many NPCs possessed SSS-tier potential? Thousands. But most remained dormant, their talents unmanifested. Many died before ever blooming.\n\nThe company hadn't expected much from Mercedes—especially since she'd been scheduled for execution by Insane Dragon Nevartan, triggering the empire's collapse. Grid and Kraugel had deleted that storyline. Then Grid saved her, and she became his knight.\n\n\"Remember Fourth Team Leader Chen? Mercedes was designed as a short-lived character, so he poured extra love into her development.\"\n\nKeen Insight—a passive skill with overwhelming potential that would compound exponentially as it leveled.\n\nChen had declared that if Mercedes survived long enough, Keen Insight could evolve into genuine Foresight. But since she'd been marked for early death with minimal long-term story impact, they'd given her that fraudulent skillset without worrying about balance.\n\n\"How could she possibly stop that monster—wait.\" Rahul paused mid-rationalization, head cocking. He recalled the Cave Cricket's combat rating matched the 28th Great Demon.\n\n\"But then how did the Cave Cricket... Ah!\"\n\nKnight Summoning! A chill raced down Rahul's spine as he remembered the absurd roster Grid had assembled over the years.\n\n\"I understand now. I see the complete picture.\"\n\nMerchant King Kir had leveraged his intelligence and resources to acquire the elves. Grid had used his combat power and allies to defeat the Cave Cricket. Once Rahul factored in their full capabilities, the impossible became merely improbable.\n\n\"Right... so no rollback. We can't reverse history the players write themselves.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And even if this *were* a bug, the Chairman would never authorize a rollback.\"\n\nThe milk had spilled. No fault existed—only natural consequences. Rahul felt his pulse steadying.\n\n\"At least it wasn't actually broken...\"\n\nThe Chairman would be pleased. Rahul thought about Lim Cheolho's obsessive interest in the Five Miracles.\n\n\"Why haven't you called that emergency meeting yet?\"\n\nThe angry voice originated from the office entrance. Chairman Lim Cheolho himself stood there, expression thunderous. For years he'd delighted in the chaos the Five Miracles generated. But not this time.\n\nLim Cheolho strode past the bewildered Yoon Nahee and Rahul, immediately cutting to the crisis. \"How many players and NPCs currently possess myth-rated items?\"\n\n\"Well...\" Production Team Leader Rahul fumbled for an answer.\n\nOperations Team Manager Yoon Nahee responded instantly: \"Seventeen.\"\n\n\"Has anyone successfully enhanced a myth-rated item?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What happens if one person enhances *multiple* myth-rated items?\"\n\n\"...The game's entire balance collapses.\"\n\nEnhancement increased an item's base statistics. Higher base stats meant exponentially higher gains per enhancement level. That's precisely why myth-rated items had catastrophically low enhancement success rates built into the system.\n\n\"This is—!\" Rahul's eyes went wide, the blood draining from his face. The Cave Cricket's drops: Ancient Weapon and Armor Enhancement Scrolls! Those items were calibrated to appear only when at least twenty percent of the player base had armed themselves with legendary-grade equipment. If Grid succeeded in enhancing myth-rated items that ordinary players couldn't even access—\n\n\"Not only the Five Miracles—most Named NPCs won't stand a chance against him.\"\n\nLim Cheolho knew those ancient scrolls guaranteed 1-3 enhancement levels. Grid possessed three weapon scrolls and five armor scrolls. He could potentially create a myth-rated weapon at +4 to +7, or armor in that same range.\n\n\"What's our move? Do we shut down the servers?\"\n\nSatisfy had no pause function by design. Implementing one would shatter player trust and drive the user base away. Lim Cheolho smiled grimly. \"No. We don't punish hundreds of millions of players because of one person's actions. I'll speak with Grid directly.\"\n\n\"You're meeting him personally?\"\n\nCompany rumors claimed the Chairman's account would manifest as a *god* inside Satisfy. Would they finally witness that? Yoon Nahee and Rahul exchanged glances, expectations soaring so high they momentarily forgot the severity of the situation.\n\n\"I can't use my position to coerce Grid. But I'm certain I can persuade him—the man genuinely loves Satisfy.\"\n\nAfter all, Satisfy had fundamentally transformed Grid's life. His attachment to the game might even exceed Lim Cheolho's own. The Chairman felt genuine hope as he logged in.\n\n> **[Name: S.A Group Chairman Lim Cheolho**\n> **Level: 29**\n> **Class: Fisherman**\n> ***The longer the fishing time, the greater the probability of catching good fish.**\n> \n> **Strength: 29 | Intelligence: 49**\n> **Stamina: 175 | Agility: 21** \n> **Concentration: 75 | Endurance: 19]**\n\nFew environments matched Satisfy for enjoying his fishing hobby. He'd leveled his character exclusively through angling! Paranoid that someone might recognize his ID, Lim Cheolho immediately whispered Grid.\n\n&**S.A Group Chairman Lim Cheolho:** I am Chairman Lim Cheolho of the S.A. Group. This is my first time reaching out to you personally. It's a genuine pleasure. I'd very much like to speak with you, Youngwoo-ssi...\n\n> [The target has blocked you.]\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nHad something gone wrong? A different kind of chill crawled down Lim Cheolho's spine.\n\n***\n\n\"People have officially lost their minds. Now someone's impersonating Lim Cheolho.\"\n\nGrid had just finished examining the Ancient Enhancement Scrolls—guaranteed 1-3 enhancement levels—when the whisper arrived. Fame attracted spam. It was a daily reminder of exactly how many lunatics inhabited the world.\n\n\"Is something wrong?\" Mercedes asked, concern evident.\n\nGrid shook his head and drew the Enlightenment Sword. *This is the last item.*\n\nBut he felt confident this wouldn't be a wasted scroll. The Enlightenment Sword deserved it!\n\n\"Please be +3!\"\n\nGrid brimmed with ambition as he activated the Ancient Weapon Enhancement Scroll without hesitation. Surely Pagma's Descendant's legendary traits would push the enhancement straight to +3.\n\nThe result?\n\n> [You have successfully enhanced the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires!]\n\n> [The Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has increased to **+1**!]\n\n\"Damn this rotten luck bullshit system!\"\n\nOne-in-three odds, and he hit the *minimum*? Grid's fury peaked. He nearly hurled the +1 Enlightenment Sword into the ground.\n\nThen he stopped.\n\n> [You have succeeded in enhancing a myth-rated item, and a hidden feature of Pagma's Descendant has unlocked!]\n\nThe new notification window doused his rage and disappointment instantly.\n\nSimultaneously, Lim Cheolho muttered, \"I'm going to Grid's house.\"\n\nHe rushed to his car after logging out.\n\nLim Cheolho—preeminent scientist, arguably the greatest mind of the modern era, a man even the President struggled to schedule meetings with—was about to visit an ordinary(?) young man's home. If the media caught wind, it would dominate global headlines for weeks."
