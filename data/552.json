  "content": "*The Red Phoenix Bow is the strongest weapon.*\n\nGrid's conviction wasn't born from wishful thinking or blind hope. It was absolute certainty, forged from irrefutable evidence.\n\n*First: the design itself.* The quality of the blueprint surpassed anything he'd crafted before. If the original Red Phoenix Bow existed, it would undoubtedly carry a myth rating.\n\n*Second: the materials.* White phosphorus wood and Red Phoenix Breath—both extraordinary. The Red Phoenix Breath, in particular, likely rivaled adamantium in quality. Adamantium came from Asgard, the realm of the gods. Which meant the Red Phoenix Breath was divine in origin. *A fragment of a god's power.*\n\n*Third: his concentration.* Over the past three days, Legendary Blacksmith's Patience had activated four times. Four times. That had never happened before—not once since he'd become Pagma's Descendant.\n\n*With Patience active, fatigue doesn't touch me. I can work without rest, without distraction.*\n\nA perfect storm of optimal conditions. When combined, they could only yield one result: perfection.\n\n> [You can no longer smelt the Red Phoenix Breath. It is already in the best form.]\n\n> [Strengthened Red Phoenix Breath]\n> *The aura of the Red Phoenix enhanced by the legendary blacksmith Grid.*\n> *Increases fire resistance by 40% even when carrying it in the inventory.*\n> *It can be used to infuse items with the powerful aura of the Red Phoenix.*\n> *However, it can only be attached to items with a strong fire attribute.*\n> *Weight: 2*\n\nThe strengthened breath pulsed with contained violence. Flames writhed within the ruby like caged beasts desperate for release.\n\n*Now. The bow itself.*\n\nGrid stoked the furnace higher, channeling every scrap of knowledge he possessed into handling the white phosphorus wood. The minotaur horns and additional materials waited nearby, ready for integration.\n\n*The others can hold on. They're strong. I don't need to worry—I just need to do my job.*\n\nGrid didn't realize it, but his mindset had shifted. His guildmates faced danger he couldn't prevent. That knowledge forced him to suppress anxiety, to silence the catastrophic scenarios his mind conjured. In fighting that internal battle, his concentration sharpened to a razor's edge. His hands moved with unconscious precision, wielding tools with perfect economy of motion.\n\n*Chiiiik!*\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid watched the water vapor rise from the heated white phosphorus wood as it cooled. The steam caught the light, shimmering without wavering. Like starlight piercing the darkness.\n\n> [The Legendary Blacksmith's Patience skill has been activated.]\n\n\"...Good.\"\n\nOnce again! Grid's smile turned sharp and predatory as his fatigue evaporated and his focus crystallized at its peak. Around him, the blacksmiths of White Hammer smithy could only stare in reverent awe. Four days. Four days without rest, without faltering.\n\nThe next evening arrived.\n\n> [The Legendary Blacksmith's Breath has been activated.]\n\nThe welcome notification appeared as Grid entered the final stage. He attached the Red Phoenix Breath to the completed bow frame. A crimson aura bloomed around the white wood, spreading like wildfire across its surface. Grid's lips moved in silent prayer.\n\n*Please!*\n\nA legendary rating—that's all he asked for!\n\n...No, wait. Was that too greedy? Maybe he should hope for unique instead.\n\n*Then I can use Item Upgrade to push it to legendary anyway.*\n\nThe moment doubt crept into his mind—\n\n*Paaaat!*\n\nThe Red Phoenix Bow blazed with light. The white wood drank in the essence of the Red Phoenix, its color shifting to vibrant orange-red. Intense. Alive. Like flames given form.\n\nAnd then—\n\n> [An unexpected situation has occurred!]\n\n\"...?\"\n\n*Unexpected situation?*\n\nIce water flooded Grid's veins. \n\n*What the hell does that mean?*\n\nSatisfy had stabbed him in the back more times than he could count. His expectations had been shattered again and again. Instinct screamed that something had gone wrong. That the system had found a new way to screw him over.\n\nBut this time—\n\n> [The rating of the item you produced is higher than legendary.]\n\n> [It is the result of breaking the limits due to the production method, the materials, and the maker's commitment.]\n\n\"...Ah!!\"\n\nThe memory hit him like lightning. During the papal election. When he'd analyzed and reproduced <span class=\"myth\">Lifael's Spear</span>, his blacksmithing had evolved from 'Witness of God's Weapon' to 'Understanding of God's Weapon.' That upgrade gave him an infinitesimal chance—barely worth acknowledging—of producing a <span class=\"myth\">myth (reproduction)</span> item. But the odds were astronomical. He'd never expected it to actually happen.\n\n*I wasn't banking on this!*\n\nBut here it was. A myth reproduction. Grid's chest swelled with an emotion beyond mere joy—a tidal wave of exhilaration that threatened to burst from his ribcage.\n\nExcept—\n\n> [Congratulations!]\n\n> [You are the first player to produce a myth rated item!]\n\n> [The title 'Watched by the Gods' has been acquired.]\n\n> [(Understanding of Gods' Weapons) Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship Skill has evolved into (Seeing the Gods' Techniques) Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship Skill.]\n\n\"Wow.\"\n\nGrid's eyes went wide as dinner plates. Not a reproduction. A *pure* <span class=\"myth\">myth rating</span>. His heart stopped. Actually stopped for a heartbeat before slamming back to life. His mind went blank, wiped clean by shock.\n\nWith trembling hands, he pulled up the updated skill information.\n\n> [(Seeing the Gods' Techniques) Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship Skill Lv. 8]\n> *There is a high probability of producing <span class=\"rare\">rare</span> ~ <span class=\"epic\">epic</span> rated items.*\n> *There is a certain probability of creating <span class=\"unique\">unique</span> rated items.*\n> *There is a rare probability of creating <span class=\"legendary\">legendary</span> rated items.*\n> *If certain conditions are met, there is a very rare probability of making a <span class=\"myth\">myth (reproduction)</span> or <span class=\"myth\">myth</span> rated item.*\n> *All stats of a production item will increase by 21%.*\n> *When <span class=\"myth\">myth</span> rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by **+10** and reputation throughout the continent will rise by **+1,000**.*\n> *Something special will occur with every three <span class=\"myth\">myth</span> rated items created. (Currently 1/3)*\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid's elation lasted exactly five seconds before his expression curdled.\n\n\"No, dammit... Legendary items don't give me any stats now?\"\n\nThis was too much. *Way* too much. Making <span class=\"legendary\">legendary</span> items—which were still incredibly difficult—now earned him nothing? The penalty for reaching <span class=\"myth\">myth</span> tier was savage. His shoulders sagged.\n\n*The future looks... uncertain.*\n\nAnd that line about \"something special\" happening every three <span class=\"myth\">myth</span> items? His guts told him that \"special\" was code for \"catastrophically bad.\"\n\n\"This damn Korean game.\"\n\nAlways stingy. Always squeezing players dry despite the monthly subscription fees. Classic Korean gaming company behavior. Grid couldn't even bring himself to check the Red Phoenix Bow's stats when a commotion erupted from outside.\n\n\"D-Demon...!\"\n\n\"Pointy-eared demon!\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nAn uproar at the smithy's entrance. The White Hammer blacksmiths' voices rang with genuine fear.\n\n*Pointy-eared demon?*\n\nWhat kind of monster would terrify seasoned blacksmiths? Grid armed himself with <span class=\"legendary\">Sword Ghost</span> and strode outside. Then froze.\n\n\"Sticks!\"\n\nThe \"pointy-eared demon\" that had the blacksmiths quaking in their boots was Sage Sticks. The person Grid had been desperately waiting for!\n\nBut—\n\n\"Why are you being treated as a demon?\" Grid asked, baffled.\n\nAn elf. A noble existence beloved by nature itself. Elves cherished peace, despised demonkin, and were historically honored by all peoples. It made no sense that these blacksmiths would label him demonic.\n\nSticks extended his hand toward Grid, urgency radiating from every line of his body.\n\n\"I can't speculate on the details, but the East Continent might face complications that are... difficult to untangle. We need to return. Now.\"\n\nGrid's priorities snapped into focus. The East Continent's problems could wait. His guildmates couldn't.\n\nGrid nodded and clasped Sticks' hand. Light flared, and both vanished.\n\n---\n\n\"A small kingdom's stronghold is at *this* level...?\"\n\nBubat, master of the Yak Guild and lord of a minor territory, stared up at Patrian's towering walls. The sight stirred both admiration and envy in his chest.\n\n*Those walls are at least level 8.*\n\nWhich meant their durability exceeded one million points. Magic bombardment and skill attacks from level 100 or 200 players would barely scratch the surface. Breaking through required either third advancement magicians or high-level siege weaponry.\n\n*If I could acquire even one fortress like this...*\n\nThe Yak Guild had considerable manpower and capital. They'd spent five grueling months raising a single wall by one level. And each subsequent level required exponentially more resources and time. In other words, players couldn't realistically construct level 8 walls through normal means.\n\n*Grid got this for free... Tsk.*\n\nEarl Ashur had sided with Grid since the Reidan invasion. Grid had cultivated that relationship from the earliest days, and now reaped the rewards—including this magnificent fortress.\n\n*I don't want to admit it...*\n\nGrid operated on a different level than other high rankers. He didn't rely solely on personal combat power or flashy skills.\n\n*Capturing NPC loyalty. That's Grid's greatest weapon!*\n\nLeft unchecked, Grid's influence would grow without limit. Personal grudges aside, Bubat had an obligation to suppress any top-tier competitor. But the task proved difficult. The Eternal Kingdom simply lacked third advancement players.\n\n*We'll have to maximize the siege weapons.*\n\nEternal's army deployed twelve catapults. Unfortunately, they'd proven ineffective. Patrian boasted prominent magicians—Zednos, Laella, and Euphemina. Their spells easily neutralized the catapult bombardment. Especially that girl, Euphemina.\n\nHer defensive magic was perfectly optimized, countering every attribute thrown at her.\n\n*That monster... Did she obtain a legendary great magician class?*\n\nBubat clicked his tongue and shifted his attention to the battlefield. Thousands of Eternal infantry attempted to scale Patrian's walls, only to be repelled by endless volleys of magic, arrows, and stones. The Overgeared unit led by Regas proved particularly devastating. They'd sallied forth multiple times, each sortie inflicting severe casualties on Eternal's vanguard.\n\n*Fortunately, Jishuka's exhausted. Now that she's resting, it's time to eliminate Regas.*\n\nDefeating Regas' group would break Overgeared's defensive coordination. Climbing those walls would become trivial. Bubat turned to Jeff and Ralph, confidence gleaming in his eyes.\n\n\"We're finally moving?\" Jeff asked.\n\n\"My body was getting stiff,\" Ralph added.\n\n\"Can't just spectate anymore,\" Bubat agreed.\n\nThe damage dealers of Overgeared were occupied—destroying siege weapons, disrupting formations. The environment was finally safe enough for Bubat, Jeff, and Ralph to unleash their full power.\n\n\"Target: Regas!\" Bubat barked.\n\n\"Kill anyone who interferes!\" Jeff snarled.\n\nBubat, Jeff, and Ralph led their guilds forward. Eternal soldiers who blocked their path died without ceremony. Within minutes, they reached Regas, who was locked in combat with a cluster of Eternal troops.\n\n\"Avoid it!\" Regas' scream cut through the battlefield chaos.\n\nThe thirty Overgeared members—former Silver Knights—heard their leader's warning and tried to react.\n\n*Kurururung!*\n\nThunder rumbled. The earth *erupted*.\n\nAn earthquake triggered by Bubat—widely considered the best initiator among high rankers.\n\n\"Aaaack!\"\n\n\"Hiik!\"\n\nThe Overgeared members, averaging level 230, stood no chance against the wide-area crowd control. Bodies lifted off the ground, helpless.\n\nRegas barely escaped the effect, his face twisting with strain. Bubat seized two floating Overgeared members by their faces, his grin savage.\n\nBubat's smile widened.\n\n*Kwajajak!*\n\nHe *slammed* both skulls into the ground with bone-crushing force.\n\nThe signal for reversal had been given."
