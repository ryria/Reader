Sounds like a fair deal to me.\"\n\nFive men filed through the entrance. Broad-shouldered thugs with scarred knuckles and the kind of swagger that came from hurting people for a living. The kind that reminded me way too much of the collectors from Mother's Heart is Happy Financial Services.\n\nThe leader shoved a document at the elderly blacksmith.\n\nI glanced at the paper. A property transfer contract. Seller: The smithy owner. Buyer: Mero Company.\n\n*Shit.*\n\n*I know exactly where this is going. If I stand here another second, the system's going to shove some idiotic quest down my throat.*\n\nThat couldn't happen. Not now. I needed to craft items and earn money, not get dragged into NPC drama.\n\n*No time to waste on unwanted quests.*\n\nI congratulated myself on my quick thinking and took a step back toward the exit.\n\nI made it three steps.\n\n\"Hey.\" A meaty hand clamped down on my shoulder. \"Where do you think you're going, rat?\"\n\nThe gangster spun me around. His breath reeked of cheap alcohol and violence.\n\n\"Trying to sneak a peek at our business?\" His eyes narrowed. \"You a spy? The Skaner Company send you?\"\n\n*Why did I look at that stupid contract? Curiosity killed the cat, and it's about to kill me too.*\n\n*Should've stayed in the back. Should've kept my head down.*\n\nI forced a shrug, trying to project 'harmless idiot' with every fiber of my being. The message was clear: *Spy? Me? You've got the wrong guy. I just want to leave.*\n\nBut they weren't buying it.\n\nThe gangster's grip tightened. Sweat beaded on my forehead.\n\n*Damn it.*\n\nAll those memories from my early days in Satisfy came flooding back. Getting shaken down by teenage NPC thugs in back alleys. Being someone's errand boy because I was too weak to fight back. And worst of all, they looked exactly like the loan sharks who made my real life hell.\n\nMy shoulders hunched involuntarily. I couldn't help it.\n\n*Just behave. Don't make trouble.*\n\nViolent NPCs didn't fear guards or consequences. They'd beat you bloody before you could scream for help, and by the time the law showed up, you'd already be respawning at the church. Sure, I could report them afterward, but their fists were a lot closer than justice.\n\n*If I were stronger, or faster, maybe I could run. But I'm not. So don't piss them off.*\n\nThese weren't ordinary street punks either. The Mero Company was the second-largest commercial enterprise in the Eternal Kingdom. They didn't hire amateurs.\n\n*Look at their gear. Level 35, minimum.*\n\nLevel 35 gangsters. How many skulls had they cracked to reach that level? How many people had they terrorized, robbed, or worse?\n\n*Five of them. One of me. I'm level 3.*\n\nSure, my stats were better than average for my level thanks to the capsule, but that still put me around level 20 in effective strength. Five against one were terrible odds. And I didn't even have a weapon.\n\n*Right. Swallow your pride. Live to fight another day.*\n\nI plastered on my brightest smile. \"I'm not spying on anyone. I'm just a customer passing through. No need to worry about me. Really.\"\n\n*Groveling to NPCs. No shame. Whatever it takes.*\n\nThe hand on my shoulder loosened slightly.\n\n\"A customer?\" The gangster's tone dripped with skepticism. \"At this dump?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Interesting.\" His grip tightened again, fingers digging into my collarbone. \"Because the Mero Company operates plenty of weapon shops on this street. Good ones. So why would a 'customer' come to this shithole smithy?\"\n\n*Ow. That hurts.*\n\nI fought to keep the grimace off my face. Curse words bubbled up in my throat, but I choked them down.\n\n*Don't react. Don't give them an excuse.*\n\n\"The weapon shops sell finished goods,\" I said, maintaining that brittle smile. \"This is the only smithy. I need custom work done, not off-the-rack merchandise. I'm new to Winston, so I had no idea there was... trouble here.\"\n\n*Keep smiling. There's an old saying: you can't spit on a smiling face.*\n\nThe gangster studied me for a long moment, eyes boring into mine. Then he released me with a disgusted snort.\n\n\"I feel like punching you anyway, but fine. You're a blacksmith too, huh?\" He looked me up and down. \"Yeah, you're too pathetic to be a spy. Get lost. And don't come back here.\"\n\n*He feels like hitting me? Because I look weak and poor?*\n\nRage flared in my chest, hot and bitter. These scum thought they could humiliate me just because I didn't look like much?\n\n*Be patient. Almost out of here.*\n\n\"Thank you for understanding.\" I bowed slightly, smile never wavering. \"I'll be on my way.\"\n\nI turned toward the door, keeping my movements slow and non-threatening.\n\n\"There's no point dragging this out,\" the old blacksmith's voice cracked behind me. \"You've made my life miserable enough. I'm tired of fighting.\"\n\nI paused mid-step.\n\nThe old man's eyes were bloodshot. He blinked rapidly, fighting back tears.\n\n\"Give me the contract.\" His voice was barely a whisper. \"I'll sign.\"\n\n\"Really?\" One of the gangsters' faces lit up.\n\n\"Finally! About damn time!\"\n\n\"Took you long enough, but you made the right choice.\"\n\nThe thugs celebrated like they'd won the lottery. The leader, Veil, stepped forward and offered the contract with an exaggerated flourish.\n\n\"Just sign here. Then you can relax.\"\n\nThe old man stared at the paper. His hand trembled as it reached out. A tear rolled down his weathered cheek.\n\n\"Seven generations,\" he whispered. \"Seven generations of my family's work... How can I face my ancestors after this?\"\n\nThe sight twisted something in my gut.\n\n*This is wrong.*\n\nBut the gangsters just laughed.\n\n\"You stopped smithing, so your customers left,\" Johnson sneered. \"Natural consequences. And wasn't there supposed to be a kid? Your son's dead, right? Drank yourself stupid over it. No heir means no legacy. You were protecting nothing. Just accumulating debt like an idiot. Pathetic.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare speak of my son!\" The old man's voice broke with fury.\n\n\"Why are you yelling?\" Johnson stepped closer, fist raised. \"Want me to shut you up like last time?\"\n\n*That's it. Threatening an old man.*\n\nHeat built behind my eyes. My fists clenched.\n\n\"Hurry up and finish the contract,\" Um said impatiently.\n\nPraga bounced on his heels like an excited child. \"I'm so pissed. Do you know how many months we wasted on this geezer? How much we suffered because he wouldn't cooperate?\"\n\n\"Right?\" Neil nodded. \"We couldn't even handle one old man properly. Our boss docked our pay because of the delay.\"\n\nVeil's smile turned predatory. \"Exactly. Which means you owe us compensation.\"\n\nHe slapped the old man across the face. The crack echoed through the smithy.\n\n\"Listen up, old timer. When you get the money from selling this place, half goes to your debt. The other half? That comes to us. For our trouble.\"\n\n\"You bastards!\" The old man, Khan, looked ready to attack despite his age.\n\n\"Come on, it's not like you have a wife or kid to feed.\" Veil spread his hands in mock sympathy. \"Why does a lonely old drunk need so much money? Think of it as charity. Helping out poor young entrepreneurs like us.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nMy blood boiled.\n\n*I don't particularly respect the elderly.* I'd never given up my seat on the bus or subway. I paid the same fare, so I had the same right to sit. No matter how much they glared.\n\n*But I never insulted them.*\n\nNot like this. Not kicking someone when they were down.\n\n*These punks treating an old man like garbage... it's disgusting.*\n\nSo what was I going to do about it? Step in and help, despite being low-level and outnumbered?\n\n*No. Hell no.*\n\nI didn't have a hero complex. Why should I risk my neck for someone else's problem? There was no benefit to me.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I never understood superheroes. Everyone else admired them. I thought they were idiots.\n\n*Why get hurt saving strangers? Are they insane?*\n\nI couldn't comprehend why heroes sacrificed themselves to defeat villains. Their selflessness made me cringe. So when the neighborhood kids played heroes and villains, I always chose to be the villain. I enjoyed making the 'heroes' suffer. Of course, I had the sense to pretend to lose at the end so nobody held grudges.\n\n*I've been like this since childhood. Always looking the other way when I saw injustice.*\n\nSo I would walk away. Let the old man lose his seven-generation legacy. Sure, I'd feel a little guilty.\n\n*Whatever. The situation's ruined anyway. Can't craft items here now.*\n\n*Do I really have to pay for another expensive carriage to a new village? Ugh, maybe I'll just hunt and level up until the new owner opens for business.*\n\nWait.\n\n*Don't I need equipment to hunt? And my sword and armor are in the warehouse storage!*\n\n*My 50 silver!*\n\nThe stress was giving me an ulcer. Why was my life always twisted like this? Every time I tried to move forward, something dragged me back.\n\n*Just leave. Get out of here.*\n\nBut my feet wouldn't move.\n\n*Is it really okay to abandon that old man?*\n\n*Damn it!*\n\nMaybe it was because I'd witnessed the whole thing. No matter how far I'd strayed from being a good person, I still had some shred of human decency. My conscience wouldn't let me ignore an old man surrounded by thugs.\n\n*But why risk myself for a stranger? Am I stupid?*\n\nI knew I should walk away. So why was I hesitating?\n\n*Since when did I become nosy? This isn't like me. I've always ignored injustice.*\n\nI took a deep breath. Steeled myself. Started toward the door.\n\n> **[Your anger levels are at their peak after witnessing gangsters commit wrongdoings towards a blacksmith.]**\n\n> **[The quest 'Blacksmith's Rage' has been created.]**\n\n*Of course.*"
