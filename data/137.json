During these rare alignments, the coastal waters of Brinichi retreated with the tide, exposing a secret path beneath the waves.\n\nA girl stood at the water's edge, staring down at the glittering trail.\n\n\"I finally found it.\"\n\nSplash. Splash.\n\nShe moved forward, ignoring the water soaking through her shoes and dress. The mysterious purple glow beckoned her deeper. At the point where the path descended into darkness, she paused. Drew a breath. Then she lifted a flute to her lips and began to play.\n\nThe melody drifted across the calm surface. Moonlight painted the scene in silver, the lone girl and her music creating something almost otherworldly. A notification window materialized.\n\n> [You have played Laurelia's Flute. You can breathe underwater for 25 minutes.]\n\nThe girl gathered her courage and dove.\n\nIridescent fish scattered as she swam along the luminous path. The weight of the ocean pressed against her from all sides, but the flute's magic kept her lungs clear. At last, the path opened into something magnificent.\n\n> [You are the first discoverer of the Siren Kingdom!]\n>\n> [It is a place passed down in legends. If you create and sell a map of this place, you can earn great reputation and gold.]\n>\n> [If you sell the map first to the 3rd Prince of the Saharan Empire, a quest will be generated.]\n\n*I'll deal with the map later.*\n\nFirst discoveries brought incredible benefits in Satisfy. Among two billion users, being first to anything was an achievement worth celebrating. But Euphemina had other priorities.\n\nShe'd come for one thing: the production method for Mumud's Orb. Braham's first disciple had created it five hundred years ago, and somewhere in this underwater kingdom, his descendants held the secret.\n\n*I need to find it quickly and bring it to Grid.*\n\nThe memory surfaced unbidden. She'd saved Grid from Winston's dungeon, and in exchange, he'd promised to craft her an orb. She'd already done the research. Braham's original orb was the best in recorded history, but its usage requirements were astronomical. Mumud's version, while less powerful, was actually attainable.\n\nEuphemina kicked toward the structures ahead.\n\n\"It won't be much longer now.\" Her voice created bubbles in the enchanted water. \"Grid, I'll find you soon.\"\n\nShe wanted to see him again. Not just for the orb, though that was important. He'd made her feel helpless during their last encounter, her epic class irrelevant against his growth. She wondered how much stronger he'd become since then.\n\n\"It's just curiosity. Pure curiosity.\"\n\nHeat crept up her neck despite the cold water. The inhabitants of Siren watched the blushing surface-dweller and confirmed their suspicions that humans were very strange creatures indeed.\n\n***\n\nYoungwoo jolted awake.\n\n\"Shit.\"\n\nDarkness still filled the windows. The TV flickered with late-night programming, volume muted. Sweat soaked through his shirt and the coat he'd fallen asleep in. His spine felt like someone had dragged ice down it.\n\n*What was I dreaming about?*\n\nHe couldn't remember, but his body knew it had been bad.\n\nYoungwoo peeled off the damp coat and headed for the bathroom. The shower hissed to life. Steam filled the small space as he stepped under the spray.\n\nThis was unusual. His normal routine was washing every three days, just enough to stay presentable. An early morning shower, unprompted? That never happened.\n\n*But tonight is special.* A grin spread across his face despite the lingering unease. *First night with Irene. I should be clean for that.*\n\nHe hummed tunelessly while scrubbing, then threw on fresh clothes and went straight to the capsule. Before connecting to Satisfy, he opened his laptop.\n\nHis fingers flew across the keyboard, the rapid clicking betraying his excitement. The search query was simple: 'sex in Satisfy.'\n\nHundreds of thousands of results populated the screen.\n\n\"Oh!\" Youngwoo leaned closer. \"So it works with NPCs too! Wait, what's this?\"\n\nHe scrolled through the first article. Satisfy replicated reality in nearly every aspect, including physical intimacy. But the S.A. Group had implemented restrictions to prevent abuse and irresponsible behavior.\n\n*...Sex in Satisfy can only happen when formally married, and is limited to once per month. If these conditions aren't met, sexual functions are impossible.*\n\nYoungwoo stared at the screen.\n\nThen he slammed his fist on the desk.\n\n\"Dammit! Only once a month?\"\n\nTwenty-seven years. Twenty-seven years he'd waited, and now there were rules? His imagination had already painted elaborate pictures of passionate nights with Irene, frequent and enthusiastic. This limitation felt like a cage.\n\n\"Once a month! I finally get the chance and it's once a month!\" He slumped in his chair like a child denied candy. \"Who designed this system? Of course it's not enough!\"\n\nFor a full minute, he wallowed.\n\nThen logic reasserted itself. *So what if it's once a month? I've gone twenty-seven years with zero, so once a month is... actually incredible.*\n\nMaybe it was the early hour making him philosophical. Maybe it was just acceptance. Either way, the frustration faded.\n\nYoungwoo noticed a recommended book in the sidebar: '100 Techniques to Satisfy Women.' He purchased it without hesitation.\n\n\"Oh. Ohhh!\"\n\nThe book was a revelation. Detailed diagrams, expert commentary, techniques he'd never imagined existed. Youngwoo read with the focus he'd never given to any tutorial or guide. Time evaporated around him.\n\nWhen he finally looked up, sunlight streamed through the windows. The clock read 11 AM.\n\n*Parents are at work. Sehee's at school.*\n\nHe had the house to himself.\n\nYoungwoo headed to the kitchen and made a substantial meal. Energy would be important. After eating until pleasantly full, he took another bath, then reviewed the book's key sections one more time.\n\n*Perfect. I'm ready.*\n\nHe returned to the capsule with the confidence of a man prepared for anything. His hand was on the lid when he paused.\n\n*Wait. One more bathroom trip. Just in case.*\n\nWhen he finally settled into the capsule, truly ready this time, anticipation thrummed through his veins.\n\nThe login sequence initiated.\n\n***\n\nKhan's smithy buzzed with activity.\n\nMost of the Tzedakah Guild had gathered in their unofficial headquarters, and every head turned when Grid materialized. Vantner pushed through the crowd.\n\n\"Grid!\" His face was red. \"What the hell did you do to make Lady Irene marry you?\"\n\nTwo days ago, by Satisfy's calendar, Grid had returned to Winston after a forty-day absence. Vantner had been waiting eagerly, happy to see his guild master return safely. Then Irene had run straight into Grid's arms. At the celebration feast that night, she'd announced their engagement.\n\nVantner grabbed Grid's collar. \"Why? Why you? What do you have that I don't?\"\n\nFor weeks, Vantner had worked tirelessly to gain Irene's favor. User-NPC romances happened all the time in Satisfy. But Irene was Earl Steim's only daughter, as unreachable as a flower on a cliff face. Even as a ranker, Vantner had never managed more than a polite greeting. No quests. No opportunities.\n\n\"How did you get close to her?\" Vantner's voice cracked. \"How did you win her over? Your level is lower than mine, and you're definitely uglier!\"\n\nThe outburst drew Pon's attention.\n\n\"Hey now.\" Pon walked over, spear resting on his shoulder. \"Saying he's uglier than you is pretty harsh. Especially coming from a bald guy.\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Vantner whirled on him. \"I've told you a hundred times I'm not bald in reality!\"\n\n\"Sure, you told me a hundred times. But you're bald here, aren't you?\" Pon gestured at Vantner's gleaming scalp. \"And think about the age difference. Lady Irene looks like a teenager next to you. What kind of creep goes after a girl that young?\"\n\n\"What? Age doesn't matter in love!\" Vantner shoved Pon's chest. \"Don't mock my pure feelings!\"\n\n\"Pure?\" Pon shoved back. \"You want to fight? I'll show you what my Gale Spear can do!\"\n\n\"Try it! We'll both die here today!\"\n\nThe two squared off, letting Grid slip away in the chaos. He found Jishuka leaning against the far wall.\n\n\"What's everyone doing here?\" Grid asked. \"Why the crowd?\"\n\n\"You're asking?\" Jishuka smiled. \"We're attending your wedding. You're getting married in Satisfy. First user-NPC wedding any of us have seen. Of course we're curious.\"\n\n\"Aren't you busy with Bairan?\" Grid frowned. \"Can a lord really leave their territory?\"\n\n\"Being a lord would suck if I couldn't take a day or two off. I've got time. Left Toban in charge for emergencies.\" She tilted her head, studying him. \"You know, you seem different.\"\n\n\"Different how?\"\n\n\"Normally you'd have cursed Vantner out by now. But you just let it slide.\" Her smile widened. \"Your personality matured.\"\n\n\"I'm almost thirty. I've always been an adult.\"\n\nGrid answered casually, but internally, he was surprised too. Every time he logged into Satisfy lately, his mind felt clearer. Calmer. More centered than in reality.\n\nThe insight stat was working its subtle magic. Six hundred points wasn't enough to comprehend the world's deepest truths, but it granted him perspective. When dealing with others or facing unexpected situations, he could analyze and react appropriately. The emotional control came naturally now.\n\n\"Where's Faker?\" Grid glanced around. \"I need to ask him something.\"\n\nHe'd acquired three items from the assassins on the road to the Vatican. Kenen's Dart Belt was straightforward equipment he could wear. But the trap installation tools and poison combination machine were different. They were expert items, tools that required manual skill to operate. Even Pagma's Descendant couldn't use them without learning the techniques.\n\n\"I want him to teach me how to use them.\"\n\nJishuka shrugged. \"He's here somewhere. Good luck finding him, though. He's really good at hiding.\"\n\nFaker was the number one ranked assassin for a reason. Even without stealth skills, he could erase his presence through controlled breathing and movement. In the past, he'd been furious when Euphemina's high insight had penetrated his concealment.\n\nGrid's insight exceeded what Euphemina had possessed back then.\n\nHe scanned the smithy's corners and spotted a figure in the shadows, arms crossed.\n\n\"There.\"\n\nGrid crossed the room and stopped in front of Faker. \"Can you teach me trap installation and poison mixing? I picked up some useful tools, but I don't know how to operate them yet.\"\n\nFaker's eyes widened.\n\nEveryone nearby had walked past him without noticing. But Grid had cut straight through the crowd and pinpointed his exact location. Faker studied Grid's eyes and recognized the depth there.\n\n*He's grown.*\n\n**[Author's Note: Too busy tomorrow, so you get today's chapters early instead.
