  "content": "[The option effect 'Black Flames' has activated from the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires!]\n\n[You have dealt 12,300 damage to the target!]\n\n'What?'\n\nBoth combatants froze. Neither Yura nor Agnus had expected damage in the five figures. When she'd struck him earlier with the Magic Engineering Bayonet, the number had been 4,700—respectable, but nothing like this. A basic attack from the Enlightenment Sword had just hit three times harder.\n\nEven with his passive damage reduction of thirty percent, a chill crawled down Agnus' spine. He retreated immediately while Yura pulled up the sword's information window.\n\n[+1 Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires]\n\n[Rating: Myth\nDurability: 1,660/1,660\nAttack: 3,780+189\n* 20% increase in physical attack power.\n* 20% increase in magic attack power.\n* 30% bonus fire attribute damage.\n* 30% bonus dark attribute damage.\n* 15% bonus lightning attribute damage.\n* Deals an additional 50% damage to sacred beings.\n* There is a certain probability of flames (large) being released when attacking.\n* There is a low probability of illusions being released when attacking.\n* There is a low probability of summoning a red lightning bolt when attacking.\n* There is a certain probability of a black flames explosion when attacking.\n......]\n\nHer breath caught. *This is the power of myth-rated gear.*\n\nThe bayonet Grid had given her was only unique-rated. Even legendary weapons, powerful as they were, couldn't compare to this. A single enhancement level on a myth-rated weapon matched three levels on a legendary one.\n\n*And he actually got it to +1?*\n\nShe knew there was no safe enhancement zone for myth-rated items. The success rate hovered somewhere between one in a hundred and one in a thousand—pure gambling. Yet Grid had pulled it off.\n\n*He must have saved a country in a past life.*\n\nThe man seemed cursed with bad luck half the time, but when it mattered most, fortune smiled on him. Perhaps that was what separated true heroes from everyone else—that inexplicable edge when the stakes were highest.\n\nWhat Yura didn't know was that Grid had used ancient enhancement scrolls, which guaranteed improvement without risk. Sometimes ignorance served legend better than truth.\n\n\"Heh... heheheh!\" Agnus' laughter came in sharp, convulsive bursts. Since becoming a legendary class, he'd rarely taken five-figure damage from anyone. Baal's Contractor was designed for PvP—high defensive stats were built into the class itself. Yet a basic attack had just carved away 12,300 health.\n\nGrid could distort the rules of the game itself. And now he'd passed that power to Yura.\n\n\"Kyahahahaha!\" The convulsions stopped. Agnus pressed one hand to his forehead, his expression twisted into something between a smile and a grimace. Was he... enjoying this?\n\nGrid and Yura exchanged glances. Behind them, Eat Spicy Jokbal looked nauseated while Bullet and Elizabeth visibly trembled.\n\n\"What's so funny?\" Grid asked.\n\nAgnus barely controlled his laughter. \"I'm glad to know there are no limits in this world.\"\n\n\"Limits?\"\n\nAgnus pointed at Grid with one trembling finger. \"You're proving it.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Yes. You've grown stronger. Good... that's good. That's *good!*\" His voice rose to a near-shriek.\n\nIn his mind's eye, Agnus saw her—his dead lover, smiling at him with that brightness he'd never find anywhere else. If Grid could break the system's rules, bend reality itself through sheer will and power, then resurrection wasn't impossible. His dream wasn't futile.\n\nHe stared into empty space, his eyes suddenly lucid.\n\n\"Time for your medication?\" Grid's sarcasm fell on deaf ears. Agnus had already left this moment behind, his mind fixed on a future only he could see.\n\n\"Kahaha!\" He charged Yura without warning. The Great Demon's Horn in his grip flashed forward, and the Enlightenment Sword's durability began to tick downward, its attack power similarly reduced.\n\n*Even myth-rated weapons aren't immune?*\n\nShe'd experienced the cursed blade before, but had assumed mythic gear would resist it. While her sword clashed with his, two skeleton warriors materialized behind her and swung their weapons.\n\nYura couldn't afford to take those hits. Her health had only just climbed back to a semi-safe level after chugging potions. As she started to disengage—\n\n\"Don't run! Take them head-on!\"\n\nGrid's shout cut through the chaos. Dodging gave enemies breathing room to counter. The Overgeared way was simple: trade blow for blow and trust your gear.\n\nRight now, Yura *was* overgeared.\n\n\"Got it!\" She abandoned all defensive technique, ignored the skeleton warriors entirely, and kept her focus locked on Agnus. His counterattacks? She ate them.\n\n[The option effect 'Black Flames' has activated from the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires...]\n\n[The option effect 'Red Lightning Strike' has activated from the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires...]\n\nHer relentless assault carved into Agnus' health bar. Her own wasn't safe—far from it—but his dropped faster. Her passive against evil beings helped significantly.\n\n\"Ohhhhhh!\"\n\n\"Hehehaha!\"\n\nBlack flames, red flames, and crimson lightning painted the darkness in violent strokes. Neither combatant gave ground. They ignored their own wounds, focused only on inflicting more damage than they received.\n\nAt first, Yura dominated. Agnus' health hit zero while she still had a third of her bar remaining.\n\nThen the problem revealed itself.\n\n[A legend doesn't die easily.]\n\nAgnus' Immortal passive triggered while Yura's own had already been consumed earlier.\n\n\"Damn—!\" His health locked at a single point and refused to drop. Yura backpedaled, momentum broken. Five seconds of invulnerability. She wasn't invincible, which meant she had to survive those five seconds somehow—\n\nAgnus gave her no space. The moment Immortal activated, he cast black magic into the ground around her. A ten-meter radius curse. She could have resisted a direct curse, but the earth itself couldn't fight back. The ground rotted into a viscous swamp that seized her ankles and held fast.\n\n\"No—!\"\n\n\"Look out!\"\n\nEat Spicy Jokbal and Elizabeth went pale. Yura was trapped, Agnus was invincible, and the outcome seemed inevitable. Agnus allowed himself a moment of certainty while Yura felt defeat settle into her chest.\n\nBullet closed his eyes. He couldn't watch this. Agnus was his idol. Yura was his new comrade. He couldn't cheer for either side—couldn't bear to see how this ended.\n\nGrid had other ideas.\n\nHe materialized beside Yura with Failure drawn and caught Agnus' descending blade a hand's width from her throat.\n\n\"Who said this was a duel?\"\n\nPagma's Swordsmanship, Wave erupted from Grid's reversed blade and slammed into Agnus' torso. The scream that tore from Agnus' throat was raw and guttural. He tried to wrench his sword free, but Grid was already moving.\n\nLink. The sword dance flowed like water, each strike driving Agnus backward toward the cursed swamp. Blood sprayed from a dozen cuts as the relentless combination overwhelmed his defenses.\n\nEveryone stared. Eat Spicy Jokbal, Elizabeth, Bullet, Yura—all of them stood frozen in disbelief. Grid, intervening in someone else's fight? Shameless. Cowardly.\n\nHilarious.\n\n\"Heh... hehehe!\" Agnus, the victim of this so-called cowardice, wasn't afraid at all. Of course not. Since when was anything in this world fair? Winners wrote history, defined morality, claimed righteousness. Losers disappeared into footnotes.\n\nAgnus had been a loser once. He understood this better than anyone.\n\n\"Guh—!\" Grid's momentum faltered as his feet sank into the corrupted earth. Agnus managed to halt the assault just before his Immortal duration expired.\n\nGrid, waist-deep in the swamp, shouted to Yura, \"What are you waiting for? Finish him!\"\n\n\"R-Right!\"\n\nWith Agnus distracted by Grid, the opening was perfect. Yura's blade pierced his exposed back.\n\n[Baal's Contractor has been defeated!]\n\n[You have cleared the fourth class quest, Old Enemy!]\n\n[As a quest clear reward, your sealed stats are released.]\n\n[The new skill, Sword of Light, has been acquired. Acquiring the Sword of Light skill has removed the Sword Mastery skill.]\n\nAgnus—who had fought both Eat Spicy Jokbal and Yura alone and nearly won—collapsed. His skills exhausted, his health depleted, he crumbled as the cursed swamp returned to normal earth. Yura, wrapped in blue leveling light, sank to the ground beside him.\n\nThen came Grid's voice, warm despite everything. \"Well done.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nThey sat facing each other, smiling through exhaustion. Both knew this wasn't over. Agnus would resurrect, and they'd clash again. It was inevitable.\n\nHis path opposed humanity itself.\n\n***\n\nThe first thing Agnus did after resurrection was check his inventory.\n\nHis fingers trembled as he searched for the Stone of Life. If he'd dropped it on death—\n\nIt was there.\n\n\"Thank god. Lucky...\"\n\nHis eyes reddened as he clutched the stone against his chest, relief flooding through him in waves.\n\nThen Baal's whisper slithered into his mind.\n\n—*Do you want more power?*\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\n—*You can't refuse me.*\n\n[The class quest 'Massacre (1)' has been created.]\n\n[Massacre (1)]\n\n[Difficulty: Class Quest\n1st Great Demon Baal demands human souls. Slaughter humans and deliver their souls to Baal.\nQuest Clear Conditions: Kill 1,000 players (0/1,000)\nQuest Clear Reward: 200,000 Demonic Power. Unlocks Massacre (2).]\n\n\"I'm... busy...\"\n\nHis back seemed small as he began walking, each step unsteady. The madman everyone feared was nowhere to be seen—only a lonely figure moving through the darkness, burdened by debts to demons and the dead."
