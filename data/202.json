Every time he appears on screen, the numbers climb.\"\n\nAnother director leaned back in his chair, eyes fixed on the monitors displaying the Reinhardt battlefield. Grid's companions tore through the golem army with practiced efficiency. The same army that had shattered the Giant Guild, seven hundred strong, led by Chris himself. The third-ranked player on the unified rankings.\n\n*This is what a legend looks like.*\n\nThe phrase 'Praise God Grid' had already spread across social media like wildfire. Yet even as the broadcast team celebrated, their hunger for more content gnawed at them.\n\n\"If only he'd summon Noe,\" one PD muttered.\n\nThe others nodded. The demonic cat commanded almost as much public attention as Grid himself. Children and female viewers would lose their minds.\n\nMeanwhile, the commentators in the broadcast booth scrambled to keep pace with the action on screen.\n\n\"The orator's buffs apply only once per target, but the potency is remarkable.\" The first analyst wiped sweat from his brow. \"If utilized correctly, an orator can outperform traditional support classes. The community has severely underestimated this class.\"\n\nHis colleague shook his head. \"Underestimated? Orators have been prized by nobles since Satisfy launched. The problem is scarcity. The class is brutally difficult to level.\"\n\n\"Don't forget the political applications,\" a third voice added. \"Orators are fundamentally built for persuasion and negotiation. Every top ranker must be jealous of Grid for recruiting the first-ranked orator.\"\n\n\"Speaking of rankings, Lauel demonstrates exactly why he holds that position. Rather than fighting for the spotlight, he adapts his qigong master role to pure support. That flexibility of mindset separates good players from great ones.\"\n\n\"Qigong masters typically function as rear-line damage dealers,\" another analyst interjected. \"But with Grid in the party, offensive power isn't the issue. Lauel recognized that and shifted roles. Brilliant.\"\n\nThe first commentator leaned forward. \"The real mystery is the user called Euphemina. Casting spells without incantation? She's definitely a hidden class. Possibly stronger than Grid himself. My guess? Legendary-rated magician.\"\n\n\"If she were legendary, we'd see more S-grade spells,\" his colleague countered. \"I'd estimate unique-rated. Still, she's clearly superior to both Yura and Bondre.\"\n\n\"I'm more interested in the girl called Ruby.\" The analyst gestured at one of the screens. \"Look at her equipment. Complete beginner aesthetics. Yet she's outputting healing numbers that rival advanced priests.\"\n\n\"Could be an intentional choice. Some high-level users deliberately adopt newbie appearances.\"\n\n\"Or she's using that new Skin Creator class. The one that changes item appearances without affecting stats. That crude wooden staff might actually be a unique-rated relic.\"\n\nLaughter rippled through the booth. \"Either way, Grid has assembled something special. A named NPC in Jude, the first-ranked orator, the first-ranked qigong master, plus the continent's best mage and priest. The man must have an incredible personality to attract such talent.\"\n\n\"I couldn't agree more. He's clearly generous, charismatic, wise, and fundamentally good.\"\n\n***\n\nOn the battlefield, Grid sneezed.\n\n*Someone's talking about me. Probably more complaints.*\n\nThe sixth ancient weapon collapsed, its massive frame crumbling to dust. Around him, his party members caught their breath. But the relief lasted only seconds.\n\nThe five remaining golems began to change.\n\n> [Ancient Weapon Update Protocol Initiated]\n> \n> [Adaptation: Spiteful Words Detected]\n> \n> [Countermeasure: Delete Language Comprehension Feature]\n\n\"Damn it.\" Grid's jaw tightened.\n\nEach time they destroyed one of these monsters, the survivors evolved. Their combat power had climbed from 26,000 to 32,000. Equivalent to the Awakened Guardian of the Forest. The difficulty curve was becoming vertical.\n\n\"My Spiteful Tongue isn't connecting,\" Huroi called out.\n\nLauel grimaced. \"Qi resistance just spiked. My skills are barely landing.\"\n\n\"Anti-magic Shield durability increased,\" Euphemina added, her tone clipped.\n\nGrid tested the ancient weapon's plating with a strike. The feedback through his blade confirmed his fears. *Physical defense rose again.*\n\n\"What kind of freak designed these things?\" He stepped back, reassessing. \"They're learning as we fight. If this pattern continues...\"\n\n*We might destroy a few more. But the last one standing will be unstoppable.*\n\n\"We should retreat,\" someone suggested. \"We've done enough, haven't we?\"\n\n\"Retreat means Reinhardt falls,\" another voice countered. \"All our kingdom contribution becomes worthless.\"\n\nDoubt crept through the ranks like poison. Grid turned to Lauel. \"Tell me you have a plan.\"\n\n\"The solution is simple.\" Lauel's expression remained calm. \"Destroy the remaining six simultaneously.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nGrid stared at him. *Is he serious?*\n\nEven assuming Grid could solo one ancient weapon, which was optimistic, the rest of the party couldn't handle a single one between them. Hell, if all hundred thousand spectating users joined the fight, simultaneous elimination would still be impossible.\n\nThen Earl Steim's voice boomed across the battlefield.\n\n\"The answer is before us! We destroy these abominations together!\" The earl raised his sword high. \"Winston's army! My son-in-law, a legendary warrior, fights to defend our kingdom! Will you stand idle?\"\n\n\"OHHH!\"\n\nThe roar of thousands of soldiers shook the air. Earl Steim, the seasoned commander who'd held the north for decades, reorganized his forces with practiced efficiency. The strongest knights from each region formed the vanguard, advancing on the six ancient weapons in coordinated groups.\n\nHis fighting spirit drew the golems' attention like blood in water.\n\n**Jeeeok!**\n\nSix mechanical heads swiveled toward the earl. Magic began to coalesce in their cores.\n\n\"Father-in-law!\" Grid's heart seized.\n\nThe quest flashed through his mind. **Save Earl Steim.** Failure meant penalties. But more than that, the thought of Irene's tears, of that beautiful smile crumbling into grief...\n\n\"Damn bastards!\"\n\nHe activated Fly, pushing the skill to its limits. Too slow. The magic power rays moved faster than thought itself.\n\n**KRAKRAKRAKOOM!**\n\nSix beams converged on Earl Steim's position. The explosion obliterated everything within twenty meters. Soldiers flew through the air like discarded dolls, their armor reduced to scrap. At the epicenter, where the earl had stood...\n\n*No one could survive that.*\n\n\"Father-in-law...\" Grid's vision blurred.\n\nIrene's face filled his mind. That gentle smile that greeted him each morning. How long would it take for the light to return to her eyes?\n\n\"I'm sorry I'm late.\"\n\nGrid's eyes snapped open. That voice. He knew that voice.\n\nThrough the dissipating smoke and dust, figures emerged. Vantner stood at the front, his massive frame planted like a mountain. Beside him, Toban's shield still glowed from absorbing the impact. Behind them, untouched and calm, stood Earl Steim.\n\nAnd surrounding them all, equipped in armor bearing the signature 'G' engraving, were the members of the Tzedakah Guild.\n\nJishuka stepped forward, bow in hand. \"You struggled fighting without us.\"\n\n\"Everyone...\" The word caught in Grid's throat.\n\n\"Please give us a command, Captain.\"\n\nThe formality in her tone carried weight. This wasn't a casual reunion. The Tzedakah Guild was placing themselves under his banner.\n\n\"First, establish the guild!\" Lauel's shout cut through Grid's emotional haze.\n\n*Right. Fifteen minimum for guild creation.* The golem invasion offered a separate guild quest. Perfect opportunity to gain experience. Grid's mind snapped into focus.\n\n\"Establish Guild.\"\n\n> [Guild establishment requires approval from the Adventurer's Association.]\n> \n> [Approval procedure bypassed. User status: High-ranking Noble.]\n> \n> [Please designate guild name.]\n\n\"The guild name...\"\n\nLauel moved closer, his expression intense. \"The name is crucial. It represents our identity. It must be meaningful and memorable. I recommend options like Darkfire Masters, Blood Ice Makers, The Blessed of the Gods, Silver Dragons...\"\n\nGrid barely heard him. Since the Neberius raid, one word had circulated in his thoughts. A term he'd coined himself, playing off Korean wordplay that felt right in his mouth.\n\n\"Overgeared Knights sounds too complicated.\" He nodded to himself. \"Let's keep it simple. Overgeared.\"\n\nLauel's face drained of color. \"What? No. Overgeared? That's... that's what elementary school children would pick! Please tell me you're joking!\"\n\n\"Better than Blood Ice Makers.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with Blood Ice Makers? It's cool! Overgeared is... it's...\" Lauel grasped for words. \"This name will define us forever! We need something better!\"\n\nThe other Tzedakah members exchanged glances.\n\n\"Overgeared.\" Vantner tested the word. \"Actually expresses what we're about.\"\n\n\"The other suggestions sound like something from a teenager's notebook,\" Jishuka added. \"This is straightforward. Clear.\"\n\nToban grinned. \"Overgeared people in the Overgeared Guild. It's simple and amusing.\"\n\n\"You're all insane!\" Lauel whirled toward Huroi and Euphemina, desperation in his eyes. \"Help me here!\"\n\nHuroi merely shrugged. He followed Grid's decisions without question. Euphemina examined her nails, clearly indifferent to the entire debate.\n\n> [User 'Grid' and 27 companions have established the Overgeared Guild.]\n> \n> **Guild Name:** Overgeared\n> \n> **Level:** 1 (0/100,000)\n> \n> **Reputation:** 0\n> \n> **Master:** Grid\n> \n> **Capacity:** 28/30\n> \n> **Affiliation:** The Eternal Kingdom\n> \n> **Alliances:** North of the Eternal Kingdom\n> \n> **Hostile Relationships:** None\n> \n> **Inclination:** Unconditionally Favorable with Winston\n> \n> **Territory:** None\n\n\"This is a nightmare.\" Lauel stared at the system window. \"The guild name is Overgeared. I'm a member of Overgeared. This can't be real.\"\n\nIronically, public reaction would prove overwhelmingly positive. The name resonated with players in a way Lauel's elaborate suggestions never could. But for now, he remained the sole dissenter.\n\nA new quest window materialized before Grid.\n\n> **[Defense War II]**\n> \n> **Difficulty:** SS\n> \n> The golem army exceeded all predictions. The kingdom's strongest guilds and armies failed to halt their advance. The ancient weapons have plunged the Eternal Kingdom into crisis.\n> \n> Defend the Eternal Kingdom by defeating them. You are the kingdom's last hope. King Wiesbaden can only rely on you.\n> \n> **Quest Clear Conditions:** Defeat the Ancient Weapons (0/6)\n> \n> **Quest Clear Rewards:** One major city, 50,000 Kingdom Contribution, Guild Level +2, 5,000,000 Gold\n> \n> **Quest Failure:** Likely collapse of the Eternal Kingdom\n\nGrid's gaze swept across his assembled forces. The frustrated Lauel. The eager Tzedakah members. The watching armies. The six ancient weapons beginning their advance.\n\n\"Everyone, listen up!\" His voice cut through the chaos. \"We take down all six simultaneously. Huroi! Toban! Buffs, now!\"\n\nThe first page in the legend of Overgeared was written that day.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**\n\n**OG:** Glossary Link.\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\n**Check out my Patreon** for early access to unedited chapters and bonus content.
