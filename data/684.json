  "content": "**The true value lay in the gloves.**\n\nGrid replayed the battle in his mind, analyzing every exchange. Where he'd excelled. Where he'd faltered. Each fight was another lesson—another chance to evolve. But this time, one detail dominated his thoughts.\n\nNot the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires. Not even Mjolnir's devastating power.\n\nThe gloves.\n\nHe flexed his fingers, studying the orange leather wrapped around his knuckles. Alex's Quick Gloves had performed beyond all expectations. The Holy Light Gloves had carried him through countless battles with their lottery option—a reliable trump card he'd grown comfortable depending on. But these... these changed everything.\n\nHis basic attack speed had *doubled*. Continuous damage spiked. Combined with the Enlightenment Blade's raw power, his ordinary strikes hit harder than some players' ultimate skills.\n\n*And it'll only get better as my agility climbs.*\n\nGrid ran the numbers. Every 1,000 agility shaved 0.1 seconds off his attack speed. At 2,876 agility, he'd hit 0.8 base speed—0.4 with the gloves equipped. Two strikes per second. Five in two seconds.\n\n*If I can reach 0.7 base...*\n\nThe gloves would push him to 0.35. Nearly three attacks per second with a longsword. His original plan had been to balance strength and agility in a 1:1 ratio. Now he saw the path forward with crystal clarity.\n\n\"Status Window.\"\n\nThe familiar interface materialized.\n\n**Name:** Grid  \n**Level:** 349  \n**Class:** Pagma's Descendant (Conditional Great Magician)  \n**Title:** One who Became a Legend *and 22 others*\n\n**Health:** 88,175 / **Mana:** 13,602\n\n**Strength:** 3,140 (+360)  \n**Stamina:** 1,967 (+580)  \n**Agility:** 2,546 (+330)  \n**Intelligence:** 1,727 (+540)  \n**Dexterity:** 3,507 (+880)  \n**Persistence:** 1,452 (+330)  \n**Composure:** 1,058 (+330)  \n**Indomitable:** 1,313 (+440)  \n**Dignity:** 1,966 (+330)  \n**Insight:** 1,806 (+330)  \n**Courage:** 1,002 (+330)  \n**Demonic Power:** 13,402  \n**Good Luck:** 241  \n**Deity:** 3\n\n**Remaining Stat Points:** 300\n\nTwelve points per level since fusing with Braham's soul. Then the First King title boosted that to fourteen. Small gains compounding over dozens of levels—but half automatically funneled into intelligence whether he liked it or not. Even accumulating points since level 301 left him with only 300 to distribute freely.\n\n*Still... intelligence isn't wasted. I need it eventually. Right?*\n\nHis jaw clenched.\n\n*Right?*\n\nThe self-deception lasted approximately three seconds before he pulled up the distribution interface.\n\n*Into agility.*\n\n**[124 points will be invested in agility. Confirm?]**\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n**[Applied.]**  \n**[Your agility has increased by 124.]**  \n**[Your agility stat is now 2,546 points.]**  \n**[Through combined title effects, 3,000 agility has been achieved.]**  \n**[Base attack speed increased by 0.1.]**  \n**[Movement speed increased by 30.]**\n\n\"Finally.\"\n\nGrid drew the Enlightenment Blade and tested the new threshold.\n\n*Syuok! Syuok! Syuok! Syuok! Syuok! Syuok!*\n\nSix attacks in two seconds. The blade traced silver arcs through the moonlight, each strike flowing seamlessly into the next. Someone might argue that professional boxers could throw four punches per second—what made three sword strikes so impressive?\n\nEverything. Boxers used compact, efficient movements with their fists. Grid was wielding a meter-long blade of folded steel. Generating that speed with a longsword was a different beast entirely.\n\n*Perfect.*\n\nHe watched the overlapping energy trails fade, satisfaction settling into his bones. 176 stat points remained.\n\n\"Hm.\"\n\nGrid drummed his fingers against his thigh. The temptation to dump everything into intelligence gnawed at him. At 2,500 intelligence, he'd unlock Fireball. With his tailoring work and steady leveling, he could master the spell relatively quickly.\n\nBut no. Patience.\n\n*Intelligence grows automatically with each level. No point forcing it.*\n\nThe real vulnerability was stamina. His items and titles kept him alive through situations that would flatline most players—but more raw health never hurt. A larger buffer meant more mistakes forgiven, more risks he could take.\n\n*But I'll wait. Better to save the points until I see what I'm missing.*\n\nHe dismissed the window and turned his attention to the loot scattered around Kruger's corpse.\n\n\"Legendary Blacksmith's Appraisal.\"\n\nThe tailoring tools materialized in his hands—scissors, knife, measuring tape, and needle. Each thrummed with latent power.\n\n**[Kruger's Scissors and Knife]**  \n**Rating:** Legendary  \n**Durability:** 171/220 **Attack Power:** 311\n\n* Increases cutting speed for cloth and leather by 10%  \n* Can cut all types of cloth and leather  \n\n*Scissors and knife used by legendary tailor Kruger throughout his life. Sharp enough and durable enough to cut through dragon scales and hide.*\n\n**Weight:** 10\n\n---\n\n**[Kruger's Measuring Tape]**  \n**Rating:** Legendary  \n**Durability:** 26/50\n\n* Increases cloth and leather tailoring speed by 15%\n\n*Measuring tape used by legendary tailor Kruger throughout his life. Fifty meters of perfectly calibrated material.*\n\n**Weight:** 5\n\n---\n\n**[Kruger's Needle]**  \n**Rating:** Legendary  \n**Durability:** None **Defense:** 30\n\n* Increases cloth and leather tailoring speed by 20%  \n* Can pierce all types of cloth and leather\n\n*A needle crafted from the molar of a silver dragon's remains—accidentally discovered by Kruger. Thin as a hair and capable of piercing any material.*\n\n**Weight:** 0\n\n---\n\n\"Damn.\"\n\nGrid had expected maybe a boost to item quality. A percentage increase to legendary proc rates. Standard craftsman fare.\n\nInstead, Kruger had focused on pure efficiency. Nothing to improve the rating of finished pieces—but a cumulative 45% speed boost to the entire tailoring process. The ability to work with *any* material regardless of grade or durability.\n\n*I can make two pieces in the time it used to take for one.*\n\nMore than that—the scissors, knife, and needle removed his greatest bottleneck. Different fabrics had different resistance. Cutting multiple materials simultaneously with ordinary tools was impossible when one fabric was tough as iron and another soft as silk. But these tools didn't care. Dragon scale or cotton, they'd cut and pierce with equal ease.\n\n*Once my tailoring skill improves, I'll be able to craft actual combat-grade cloth armor. Not just underwear.*\n\nJoy and dread warred in his chest. Faster production meant higher output. Higher output meant more work. More grinding. More hours at the forge and sewing table.\n\nHe could, theoretically, just *not* increase his workload.\n\nBut Grid knew himself better than that. The moment he slowed down, anxiety would creep in—the fear of falling behind, of wasting potential. Rest wasn't an option. Not when others were still climbing.\n\n\"Hah...\" He rubbed his temples. \"Legendary Blacksmith's Appraisal.\"\n\nThe cloth unfurled in his hands—silk, impossibly smooth.\n\n**[Mysterious Cloth]**  \n**Rating:** Legendary  \n**Durability:** None\n\n*A four-dimensional cloth that neutralizes explosion-type damage. When deployed at the point of detonation, all explosive energy is absorbed.*\n\n**Cooldown Time:** 10 minutes  \n**Weight:** 1\n\n---\n\nGrid stared at the description. Read it again. A third time.\n\n*Absorb explosion damage? You mean...*\n\nIce crawled down his spine. He signaled the God Hands, which spread the cloth taut between them. Then he swung the Enlightenment Blade directly at the silk.\n\n**[Option effect 'Black Flames' has activated!]**\n\n***BOOOOM!***\n\nFire erupted—an inferno meant to spread across ten meters, consuming everything in its radius. The heat, the concussive force, the raw destructive power—\n\n*Syuuuuuuuu...*\n\nThe cloth *drank* it. Every lick of flame, every joule of energy. The explosion folded into the silk without leaving so much as a scorch mark on the surrounding stone.\n\n\"...You've got to be kidding me.\"\n\nSweat beaded on Grid's forehead. His hands trembled slightly as he rolled up the cloth.\n\nKruger had been *prepared* for the black flames. The mysterious cloth would've negated Grid's most devastating damage source. And that ten-minute cooldown? When Kruger used it himself, the timer was probably half that—NPCs and boss monsters always got correction effects.\n\n*If I hadn't stunned him with electric shock and chained the infinite stiffness...*\n\nMost of Grid's offense would've been nullified. Kruger could've weathered the initial assault, then retreated behind his barrier to craft *another* counter-item specifically tailored to Grid's remaining abilities.\n\n*If the fight had dragged on that long, I would've been screwed.*\n\nHe clutched the cloth tighter, exhaling slowly. Footsteps echoed from behind—Sticks descending from the 62nd island's bridge.\n\n\"Three islands left,\" the sage said quietly.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nLegendary miner Gis. Legendary archer Povia. Undefeated King Madra.\n\nAccording to Sticks' research, those were the final guardians. Povia would be manageable—archers folded once you closed the distance. Gis would likely be a tank, which meant low damage output. Madra, though...\n\n*Can't underestimate any of them.*\n\nGrid rolled his shoulders and stepped onto the bridge leading to the 64th island.\n\n\"Let's keep moving.\"\n\nHe'd cleared the 63rd island without burning Immortality. No reason to waste time. The moment he crossed the threshold, blue light washed over him—the cave system sprawling wide and deep, every surface encrusted with glowing minerals.\n\nAnd in the center, lit by the azure phosphorescence...\n\n*Clack. Clack clack clack.*\n\nA massive skeleton. Easily as large as the orc death knight Agnus had fielded during the war—towering and broad-shouldered. The pickaxe in its bony hands looked almost comically small by comparison.\n\nDeath Knight Gis.\n\n\"Tankers are always durable,\" Grid muttered, activating Quick Movements and Blacksmith's Rage in rapid succession. \"Better hit hard and fast.\"\n\n***BOOM!***\n\nHe launched forward, the Enlightenment Blade igniting with black flames as he closed the distance in a heartbeat—\n\n*Ttang!*\n\nGis swung his pickaxe.\n\nInto the wall.\n\nMining.\n\nDespite Grid charging him with obvious hostile intent, the death knight simply... kept mining. Rhythmic. Methodical. Completely ignoring the intruder.\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nGrid skidded to a halt, confusion overriding combat instinct.\n\n*Is the AI broken?*\n\nMaybe this would be easier than expected. Some glitch in the programming. He could just—\n\n*Chaaeng!*\n\nThe Enlightenment Blade crashed into Gis' skull.\n\n**[Gis is mining. Gis is invincible while mining. Damage cannot be applied.]**\n\n\"...What?!\"\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nThe death knight continued working. Slow. Patient. Utterly indifferent to Grid's presence. \n\nGrid's gaze swept the cavern. Over two hundred square meters of cave. Every wall, every surface, thick with mineral deposits. Even Peak Sword—who *specialized* in mining—would need at least two weeks to clear this much ore.\n\nRealization hit like a sledgehammer.\n\n*This island isn't a combat trial. It's a TIME trial.*\n\nHe couldn't progress until Gis finished mining. Which meant his feet were nailed to this island for days. Possibly *weeks*.\n\n\"DAMMIT!\"\n\nGrid spun toward the entrance. The gate had already vanished—same as every other island. No escape until he cleared the challenge or failed completely.\n\n*Ttang...*\n\nGis mined at the pace of an arthritic tortoise.\n\nGrid checked his inventory. Four days of food remaining. Maybe five if he rationed.\n\n\"...Oh no.\"\n\nFor the first time since becoming Pagma's Descendant, true desperation clawed at his chest."
