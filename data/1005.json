  "content": "To a Sword Saint, the blade transcended the notion of mere weaponry. Even calling it an extension of the body fell short of the truth. A Sword Saint existed in unity with their sword—mind, body, and steel merged as one.\n\nRachel observed Kraugel with clinical detachment. \"Intent precedes outcome. Sword Saint Muller could sever his enemies before his blade left its sheath.\" Her red spear materialized in her grip, its curvature reminiscent of dragon flame. \"Yet you cannot cut me, even with your sword drawn.\"\n\nKraugel remained silent. The assessment was brutally accurate. From the instant Rachel appeared, he'd identified her as hostile and prepared to strike. But his body refused to obey. His Level 5 Super Sensitivity screamed warnings—attacking her would be catastrophic. The danger eclipsed even his confrontation with Grid at full power.\n\n\"The Sword Saint falls short.\" Rachel extended her free hand toward empty air.\n\n>[You have suffered 8,010 damage.]\n\nKraugel's chest sprouted a hole. The red spear had impaled him clean through. He'd seen nothing—felt nothing. No wind pressure. No telltale movement. Had she even thrust?\n\nHis agility sat at 2,600 points, earned through countless hidden quests under Kirinus' tutelage. He'd believed no human technique could elude his perception. The newly acquired title <One Who Peeked at the Peak of the Spear> reduced incoming damage by fifteen percent, but against a named NPC approaching level 500, the difference meant little.\n\n*This is something else entirely.*\n\nRealization struck. Blood coursed down his chest—irrelevant. Kraugel kept his eyes locked on Rachel. Then he saw them: intangible energies swirling around her form. Colorless. Silent. Yet unmistakably spear-shaped.\n\nOne lanced toward him.\n\nKraugel didn't dodge. Phantoms couldn't harm flesh. The ethereal blade struck his chest and dissipated with a hollow sound.\n\nNo damage.\n\nRachel's eyes widened with interest. Behind Kraugel, Kirinus smiled.\n\n>[A hidden piece!]\n\n>[Through the Sword Saint class effect, you have recognized and neutralized 'Manifestation of Will'!]\n\n>[The special stat 'Willpower' has opened.]\n\n>[You have acquired the signature skill 'Manifestation of Will.']\n\n**[Willpower]**\n**A force potent enough to distort reality itself.**\n*** Stat points cannot be distributed to this stat.**\n\n**[Manifestation of Will Lv. 1]**\n**Only those who transcend mortality can strike the intangible.**\n**Through manifestation of solid will, distort the fabric of reality.**\n*** Current Level Restriction: Offensive applications only.**\n*** Current Level Restriction: Requires equipped weapon. Manifestation matches equipped weapon's form.**\n*** Damage calculation: Willpower stat + Strength stat. Completely ignores target resistance and defense.**\n*** Targets possessing the Willpower stat will nullify this attack.**\n**Cooldown: 1 minute**\n\nKraugel tested the skill immediately. Four intangible swords materialized around him, mimicking his equipped White Tiger Sword—four, because his newly opened Willpower stat held only four points. Unlike most skills requiring manual control, Manifestation of Will operated on intent alone.\n\nThe moment he focused on attacking Rachel, the four phantom blades shot forward.\n\nThey shattered against an invisible barrier before reaching her, scattering like broken glass against her own manifested will.\n\n\"Growing in real-time?\" Rachel murmured.\n\nWhen she'd arrived, she'd instantly understood the relationship between Kraugel and Kirinus. Rage had ignited within her—memories of Piaro flooding back. Piaro, who'd walked the path of the sword to achieve the Sword Saint's peak, now frustrating himself with the spear after reaching the summit.\n\nAnd here stood another Sword Saint, learning spearmanship.\n\nShe'd thought it mockery. A denial of everything Piaro—the man she and countless imperial nobles revered—had sacrificed.\n\nBut this was no deception. The Sword Saint before her possessed unparalleled talent. Unique. Transcendent. He would surpass even Piaro.\n\nHe was a future threat to the empire's dukes.\n\n\"You cannot be allowed to live.\"\n\nYellow buds must be crushed before they bloom. The empire's survival depended on such ruthlessness. Rachel's killing intent flooded the clearing.\n\n\"The real threat,\" Kirinus stepped forward, positioning himself between Rachel and Kraugel, \"is the tyranny you've left unchecked.\"\n\n\"Real threat?\" Rachel's brow furrowed.\n\nKirinus sighed. \"Experience will teach you. Karma is coming for the empire.\"\n\n\"Your words mean nothing. Whatever threatens the empire will fail. For thousands of years we have endured. We are eternal.\"\n\n\"Pitiful.\" Kirinus shook his head. The one who'd driven the empress to her death currently devoured the empire from within, and Rachel remained blind to it.\n\n\"Sometimes violence provides the simplest solution. Come. I know why you're here, and I'll grant your wish.\"\n\nThe descendant of Harken could not tolerate another claiming the title of continental spear master. Kirinus understood Rachel's pride—and exploited it.\n\nHer response was immediate. \"Good. I feared you might flee.\"\n\nKirinus gripped an unremarkable wooden spear. Rachel's crimson weapon blazed with inner fire as they faced each other. Birds erupted from the forest canopy, fleeing the impending cataclysm.\n\nThe spears collided.\n\nThunder split the air. The earth itself buckled and tore away.\n\nKraugel's vision swam. Rachel's knights—thirty of them—locked eyes with him. Each possessed strength comparable to the Red Knights ranked in the twenties. Together, they commanded thousands of spearmen. These were the Twilight Spearmen, and they wanted Kraugel's blood for threatening their master.\n\n\"If you have time to bark,\" Kraugel raised his blade, \"you have time to fight.\"\n\n\"Impertinent bastard!\"\n\nThey clashed mid-air. Kraugel's intangible swords, combined with Control Sword and Super Sensitivity, allowed him to overwhelm the thirty knights initially. His battlefield awareness turned individual advantages into tactical superiority.\n\n\"Space Sword.\"\n\nAt the battle's opening, he carved through multiple knights before they could unleash their full power.\n\nThe White Tiger Sword—forged by Grid—sang with the Sword Saint's intent.\n\n\"You cannot live.\"\n\n***\n\nGrid stood in Reinhardt's streets, capital of the Overgeared Kingdom.\n\nHe stopped walking abruptly, head tilting skyward.\n\n*Thump. Thump. Thump.*\n\nHis heart hammered against his ribs for no discernible reason.\n\n\"Your Majesty?\"\n\nMercedes' melodic voice pulled him back. Concern shadowed her beautiful features.\n\n\"Did something happen?\"\n\n\"...No. Nothing.\" Grid checked his connection timer. Two minutes remaining. He wouldn't see Irene today. \"Mercedes, I'm logging out. Watch over the queen and prince while I'm gone.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have the maids prepare a proper meal for Jude.\"\n\nMercedes laughed softly, glancing at Jude's sleeping face. The hero who'd defended Bairan through Grid's absence had awakened long enough to eat before collapsing again. Now he drooled on his king's back, dreaming of food, completely unaware he was being carried by royalty.\n\nRespect and affection filled Mercedes' gaze as she looked at Grid.\n\n***\n\n\"God, I'm exhausted.\"\n\nYoungwoo logged out wanting nothing more than to collapse into bed. The imperial war drained him physically and mentally. But today was Friday—the second one. Date day with Yura.\n\nThe schedule had started at his suggestion. Unable to respond properly to Yura's confession, he'd proposed they take time learning about each other. Yura had suggested meeting every two weeks.\n\nShe might be mistaken about her feelings. Youngwoo intended to give her opportunities to confirm or reconsider. No matter how he analyzed it, he couldn't comprehend why someone beautiful, kind, intelligent, and lovely would choose him. Misunderstandings happened. What if they married based on illusion? Once reality set in, Yura might grow bored. Seek someone else. With adultery decriminalized in South Korea, spousal infidelity had become distressingly common.\n\n*No—I'm jumping straight to marriage again.*\n\nJust like when he'd reunited with his first love Ahyoung. He'd skipped romance entirely and mentally proposed within hours. His most vicious dark history.\n\n\"Aaaagh!\"\n\nThe shame physically hurt. Youngwoo screamed in his luxurious bathroom, looking thoroughly wretched.\n\n***\n\n\"Would you like to watch a movie?\"\n\n\"Y-Yes, let's.\"\n\nYura looked stunning. She always looked beautiful in her game armor—cool and fierce—but Youngwoo thought she looked best in casual clothes. The sky-blue sundress suited her perfectly.\n\n*The hem seems short... Ahem.*\n\nYoungwoo engaged the car's autopilot. They reached the cinema parking structure and headed for the elevators. Inside, realization struck.\n\n*Shit.*\n\nThis was his first time at a movie theater. Ever.\n\n*How do you buy tickets?*\n\nWhat about drinks and popcorn? Which seats were good? Was the front row optimal? What if he needed the bathroom mid-movie?\n\nSince Satisfy's launch, the film industry had declined steadily. Why watch movies when Satisfy offered worlds more vibrant, majestic, and brutal? The game had released during Youngwoo's university years, but Satisfy wasn't why he'd never attended theaters.\n\nDepression settled over him as the memories surfaced.\n\n*Ding~!*\n\nThe elevator arrived. Youngwoo planned to escape to the bathroom and google \"how to watch a movie in a theater.\"\n\nUnnecessary.\n\n\"Welcome, Ms. Yura, Mr. Youngwoo.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nYura had rented the entire theater. Youngwoo didn't need to navigate ticket counters or concession stands. The staff handled everything, escorting them to an empty luxury theater where they could sit wherever they pleased.\n\n\"Are you uncomfortable?\" Yura asked his stunned expression.\n\nYoungwoo smiled genuinely. \"No. I'm just thinking how perfect this is.\"\n\nHe meant it. He and Yura suited each other perfectly—both of them lacked ordinary common sense."
