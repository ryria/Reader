How the hell do I do that?*\n\nThe answer came to him slowly. He didn't need to visualize tanks or jet fighters. He needed a sword. Something simple. The shape was all that mattered, right? Grid lifted his finger and began tracing lines across the blueprint. The system corrected his strokes, refining them into crisp, clean edges that matched his intent perfectly.\n\n*It has to look cool. That's the whole point.*\n\nHe set the blade length at two meters, width at eighty centimeters, thickness at eight. The handle stretched forty centimeters.\n\nGrid stepped back, examining his work. \"This is just... a generic greatsword.\"\n\nThe finished sketch mocked him with its mediocrity. His imagination had failed him completely. He rubbed his jaw, thinking. Then an idea sparked.\n\n*What if I curve it?*\n\nHe adjusted the blade, bending it like a scimitar. Then he extended the length to three meters.\n\n\"There. That's better.\"\n\nThe revised image pleased him. It resembled an oversized scimitar with a shortened grip, carrying the brutal weight of a proper greatsword. The curved profile reminded him of a shark cutting through water. The blade section looked like a dorsal fin, while the pommel tapered into something resembling a tail.\n\nGrid admired the design for a long moment.\n\n*I actually made something sleek. Something dangerous.*\n\nThe weapon had presence. If he wielded it, people might think he was carrying an actual shark on his back. The mental image made him grin.\n\n*Who knew I had this kind of talent? Once I clear my debt, maybe I should switch to design school.*\n\nSatisfaction settled over him as he clicked the confirmation button at the bottom of the blueprint.\n\n> [Have you decided? Completing the blueprint will consume one use of your Creation skill.]\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe moment he confirmed, equations and technical language flooded the blueprint. Numbers cascaded across the surface. The system was calculating, filling in the gaps his amateur design had left behind. After several seconds, an improved schematic appeared. Technical jargon and complex formulas covered every inch of the blueprint.\n\nGrid's eyes widened. \"Wait...\"\n\nHe understood all of it. Every term, every calculation. He scanned the design, checking for structural flaws or imbalances. It was incredible. He comprehended the technical specifications of an item he'd never studied, never even seen forged.\n\n*The class compensation effect. It's actually working.*\n\nHe felt like a master craftsman, someone who'd spent decades at the anvil. The sensation was intoxicating. A new notification interrupted his appreciation.\n\n> [Please describe the characteristics of the item.]\n\nGrid's excitement surged. \"Right! The most important part!\"\n\nHe cracked his knuckles. \"This is an outstanding weapon. Attack power is one million... no, more than ten million. Weight is only one. No level requirement. It absorbs health with every attack. Summons meteors. Kills enemies in one hit, unconditionally. Ignores defense. This weapon can solo a dragon.\"\n\n> [That isn't possible. Item performance and options cannot be arbitrarily set. They are determined by materials used, design quality, and feature descriptions.]\n\nGrid deflated. \"Figures.\"\n\nHe tried again, choosing his words more carefully.\n\n\"It's a greatsword, but the unusual shape gives it tremendous cutting power. The protruding section that resembles a shark's fin allows for unexpected angles of attack. It can pierce through armor. Blue orichalcum is the material, so it's light and durable. And... and...\"\n\nGrid trailed off, scrambling for more details.\n\n*Come on, think. What else?*\n\nHis mind went blank. His vocabulary betrayed him. Worse, he realized he only knew the basic properties of blue orichalcum. Light and durable. That was it. He couldn't explain the deeper metallurgical benefits because he simply didn't know them.\n\n\"Then... just that...\"\n\nThe realization hit him like a warhammer to the skull.\n\n*Wait. If I'm designing this with blue orichalcum as the material...*\n\nHis stomach dropped.\n\n*I actually need blue orichalcum to make it.*\n\nThe material dropped from a level 200 boss monster. Grid was level negative three. He could theoretically buy it from other players, but the supply was microscopic and the price astronomical. His perfect design might be completely useless.\n\n\"Cancel! Skill cancel! Clear everything!\"\n\n> [Blueprint completion has consumed one use of the Creation skill. Canceling now will not restore the usage count. Do you still wish to cancel?]\n\nGrid's jaw clenched. \"No.\"\n\nThis was bad. He'd rushed in without thinking, without researching. The Creation skill demanded careful planning, not impulsive experimentation.\n\n> [Please name the item.]\n\n\"Uh... shit...\"\n\n> [Have you decided on 'Uhhshit?']\n\n\"What? No! Wait, what the hell is this?\"\n\nGrid didn't hesitate long.\n\n\"Failure.\"\n\n> [Have you decided on 'Failure?']\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nIt fit. A mistake that should never have been created in the first place. Disappointment settled over him as the skill usage counter decreased, but the hologram display populated with the item's statistics.\n\n---\n\n**<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Failure</span>**\n\n**Rating:** Unique ~ Legendary\n\n**Unique Rating Information:**\n- **Durability:** 699/699\n- **Attack Power:** 733~1,621 \n- **Defense:** 50\n- **Agility +30**\n- Low probability of blocking enemy attacks.\n- Certain probability of activating **'5 Joint Attacks'**.\n- High probability of activating **'Cutting'**.\n- Fear effect against enemies 20+ levels lower.\n- **Attack power +20% in dark places.**\n\n**Legendary Rating Information:**\n- **Durability:** 1,090/1,090\n- **Attack Power:** 874~1,820\n- **Defense:** 80\n- **Agility +50**\n- Low probability of blocking enemy attacks.\n- Certain probability of activating **'5 Joint Attack'**.\n- High probability of activating **'Cutting'**.\n- Generates skill **'Bisect'**.\n- Fear effect against enemies 20+ levels lower.\n- **Attack power +20% in dark places.**\n\n*A greatsword designed by a legendary blacksmith. Its unique shape provides excellent cutting ability. It resembles a shark, the predator of the sea, and instills fear in enemies. Small protruding blades along the edge increase defensive capability.*\n\n*Blue orichalcum construction ensures the weapon remains light, preventing attack speed reduction. The mineral's natural properties enhance strength in darkness.*\n\n**User Restriction:** Level 300+, Strength 5,000+, Advanced Sword Mastery Level 8+\n\n**Weight:** 550\n\n---\n\nGrid's breath caught. \"No way...\"\n\nIt was magnificent. Not a failure at all. A masterpiece. One of a kind in the entire world. And he'd created it.\n\n\"This is insane.\"\n\nThe words escaped his stunned mouth automatically. The implications crashed over him. He could get rich. Take on more debt, buy blue orichalcum, forge Failure, and list it on the trading site. The price would skyrocket. He'd clear his debt and have money left over.\n\nA legendary blacksmith. Literally a golden goose.\n\nGrid's excitement died as he continued reading. He reached the usage conditions at the end.\n\n\"Level 300?\"\n\nTwo days ago, he'd heard the first ranked player on the unified rankings was estimated at level 250.\n\n*Then 300? That's years away.*\n\nThat wasn't the only problem.\n\n\"Five thousand strength?!\"\n\nPlayers gained ten stat points per level. Even if someone invested every single point into strength at every level up, reaching 5,000 at level 300 would be nearly impossible. Titles and equipment could help, but not enough.\n\n*Some classes get bonus strength, but they're rare. And who would be stupid enough to dump everything into one stat?*\n\nThen there was Advanced Sword Mastery Level 8. The current first ranked blacksmith had intermediate level skills. Grid couldn't even guess how long it would take for someone to reach that threshold.\n\nEven if he somehow forged Failure, nobody could use it. Not for years. Maybe longer. Selling it was impossible. His dream of wealth evaporated instantly. The name proved prophetic. Failure was a failure.\n\nGrid exhaled slowly. \"So that's it. No easy way out. Shit.\"\n\nFrustration twisted in his gut, but he forced himself to think clearly. He tried to understand why such absurd usage conditions had been attached to his creation.\n\n*I tried to make it too powerful. That's the problem.*\n\nThe Satisfy development team had captured the world's attention for a reason. They weren't amateurs. Failure wasn't a random drop from hunting or raiding. It was a production item, something that could theoretically be made infinitely with enough materials. The system had balanced that potential by making the requirements impossibly high. Game balance demanded it.\n\n*Reasonable performance. That's what the Creation skill should be used for.*\n\nThe Creation skill had limited uses. Each one mattered. Grid decided to seal it away. He could create and sell superior items that didn't break game balance, earn money quickly, pay off his debt. But he didn't want to rush.\n\nThe skill should be saved. For himself. For a critical moment when he faced an impossible quest or an overwhelming enemy.\n\n*Creation is my trump card. My emergency button.*\n\nIf he fought a boss monster that dealt massive fire damage, he could design and forge an item with extreme fire resistance before the raid. If he wasn't creating items for sale, the usage conditions didn't matter. One of Pagma's Descendant's greatest advantages was the lack of equipment restrictions. He could wear anything, though penalties applied if he didn't meet the conditions.\n\nIf he created fraudulent items like Failure, he could demonstrate power far beyond normal players, even with the penalties.\n\nGrid's mind cleared. He checked the production requirements for Failure. The materials created another problem. Forging Failure required fifteen blue orichalcum ore.\n\n*Even the handle is pure blue orichalcum. I should have mixed materials. That would've reduced the ore count.*\n\nSeeing Failure's tremendous options filled him with longing. If he could wield it, his combat power would be terrifying. But obtaining blue orichalcum was impossible.\n\n*Let go of the fantasy. Move on.*\n\nGrid paused.\n\n*Wait. Could I join the Guardian of the Forest raid? That guy said level didn't matter.*\n\nHe remembered the recruitment notice. Grid turned and headed back toward the center of the square, weaving through the crowd. He spotted the dark-skinned man with the ID floating above his head.\n\nGrid stopped in front of Toban. \"I want to join the raid.\"\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms**\nOG: Glossary Link\n\n**Current Schedule:** Two chapters daily\n\n**Support:** Check Patreon for early access to unedited chapters and bonus content.
