  "content": "---\n\n**\"This is the final island.\"**\n\nThe figure before him stepped from the shadows, revealing himself with theatrical flair. Leraje—the 10th Great Demon.\n\n\"I am one of the thirty-three rulers who command Hell itself.\" His voice carried the silken menace of a predator toying with prey. A deep-brimmed hat obscured the upper half of his face, leaving only crimson lips stark against deathly pale skin. \"A supreme overlord blessed with both overwhelming power and unmatched cunning. The proof? I conquered my way to the sixty-sixth island with laughable ease.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nIt had been decades—perhaps longer—since Madra had encountered another soul. Yet the reunion brought no joy. Only the crushing weight of boredom and apathy.\n\nLeraje continued his monologue, oblivious. \"My specialty is annihilation through superior strategy. I have never once tasted defeat. The so-called legends guarding these islands? They fell like wheat before the scythe. Even that pathetic Demon Slayer Alex, who supposedly made great demons tremble, couldn't last five minutes against me.\"\n\nMore silence.\n\n\"Hmm... How tedious, attempting conversation with a mindless death knight.\" Leraje's tone shifted, curiosity creeping in as his gaze settled on Madra's sword. \"Still, this presents an intriguing opportunity. That blade at your waist—you must be Sword Saint Muller. The man who sealed several great demons, including Hell Gao himself. I've long desired this meeting. Today, I shall prove my superiority over that insufferable Hell Gao once and for all.\"\n\n**\"I am not Muller.\"**\n\nThe words cut through the air like steel through silk.\n\nWho dared mistake his identity?\n\nLeraje's composure cracked for an instant. \"Oh? A death knight with consciousness? Fascinating. If you're not Muller, then who—\"\n\n**\"Madra. King of Lubana.\"**\n\n\"Madra?\" The demon's lips twisted. \"Yes, I've heard whispers of that name. How... disappointing. I anticipated facing Muller on this final island. It seems even this concluding battle will prove worthless.\"\n\nRage ignited in Madra's chest.\n\n*Pagma, you brought me back from death's embrace... for THIS creature?*\n\n**\"200,000 Army Crushing Sword.\"**\n\n\"What—?!\"\n\nThough Madra had found no meaning in this cursed second life, though he'd been paralyzed by isolation and despair, though he'd done nothing but stare at empty skies for untold years—his skills had not dulled. Not by a single degree.\n\nTerror flooded Leraje's eyes as he finally understood the magnitude of his error.\n\n---\n\nThis confrontation had occurred long before Grid mastered the 200,000 Army Swordsmanship. The vision preserved in Madra's diary had always ended mid-sentence in the seventh chapter, leaving the outcome shrouded in mystery.\n\nBut everything changed once Grid reached level 399 and learned the technique himself. The sealed passages finally revealed their secrets.\n\n---\n\n\"*Guhk!* C-coughing... blood... I'm going to die... killed by a *death knight*...!\"\n\n**\"Anyone who cannot withstand this much is unworthy of the title 'ruler.'\"**\n\n\"King of Lubana? You're not Muller—how do you wield swordsmanship of this caliber?!\"\n\n**\"I am the Undefeated King. I have never known defeat, neither in life nor in death.\"**\n\n\"Impossible! A bluff!\"\n\nLeraje marshaled his remaining strength, but resistance proved futile.\n\nMadra's blade carved through demonic flesh and bone with surgical precision.\n\n*...This is the difference between us.*\n\n---\n\nAs Grid read the newly unlocked passages, he witnessed the overwhelming might of the true 200,000 Army Swordsmanship. The degraded version he'd learned was a candle compared to the sun—Madra's authentic technique reduced Leraje to nothing more than target practice. The great demon unleashed devastating spells in desperation, but each incantation shattered against Madra's sword like glass against a hammer.\n\n*The gap isn't just wide—it's unfathomable.*\n\nThe fragmentary glimpses Grid had caught of legends like Pagma, Braham, and the yangban Garam paled in comparison to this display. Undefeated King Madra stood in a realm beyond them all.\n\n**Thump. Thump. THUMP.**\n\nGrid's heartbeat accelerated, thundering in his ears. Admiration transformed into something deeper—a dangerous resonance with the man in the memories.\n\n*I never knew defeat.*\n\n*I... I am Undefeated King Madra.*\n\n> **★ WARNING ★**\n>\n> **You have achieved deep assimilation with Death Knight Madra, sharing his memories and emotional state. Extreme psychological distress detected—overwhelming anxiety and pain.**\n>\n> **[Mental State: Severe Confusion]**\n>\n> **System monitoring brain activity and vital signs. If danger threshold is exceeded, Death Knight Madra's Diary will be forcibly sealed.**\n>\n> **[DANGER! DANGER! Initiating emergency seal protocol!]**\n\n\"Ah—!\"\n\nThe seventh chapter slammed shut. Grid's eyes snapped open, his body drenched in cold sweat. He gritted his teeth hard enough to hurt, using the pain to anchor himself. *I am Grid. Not Madra. I am Shin Youngwoo before I am anything else.*\n\n**Thump. Thump. Thump...**\n\nGradually, his frantic heartbeat steadied.\n\n> **[Confusion status removed.]**\n>\n> **[Vital signs returned to normal parameters. The eighth chapter of Death Knight Madra's Diary is now accessible.]**\n>\n> **[Do you wish to continue reading?]**\n\n\"Haah... haah... Yes. Open it.\"\n\n**@%$P)@!#$~$X##!!!!!!!**\n\n\"...\"\n\nAnother failure.\n\nOver the following days, Grid repeatedly revisited the seventh chapter, pushing through Madra's agonizing despair each time to access the newly revealed content. He endured the psychological torture willingly—he *needed* to understand Madra and Pagma on a deeper level. More than that, he craved even the slightest glimpse of the legendary 300,000 Army Swordsmanship.\n\nBut the eighth chapter remained incomprehensible. The writing bore no resemblance to any human language—just chaotic symbols that defied interpretation.\n\nThen realization struck.\n\n*The isolation... it broke him.*\n\nMadra had vanquished every great demon that invaded the Behen Archipelago, then endured centuries alone on that forsaken island. With no one to speak to, language itself had become unnecessary. The thoughts he'd committed to paper during that period had warped into something only he could decipher—a private code born from a fractured mind.\n\n*So this is as far as the diary can take me.*\n\nGrid had suspected as much. When he'd confronted Death Knight Madra on the Behen Archipelago, the ancient warrior hadn't employed the 300,000 Army Swordsmanship. His weakened undead body, ravaged by hundreds of years, simply couldn't withstand the technique's destructive force. Given that timeline, the eighth chapter likely predated the creation of that ultimate art.\n\n*Even if it exists in here, I'd probably need to be level 499 to unlock it.*\n\nLevel 499. At his current progression rate, that milestone lay five or six years in the future. Minimum.\n\n*Great. Just great.*\n\nGrid opened his status window. Level 399. Experience: 97%.\n\nHe still hadn't leveled up despite helping take down Great Demon Berith. Granted, the raid party had included numerous high-level NPCs who'd claimed the lion's share of the experience, and the mechanics always disadvantaged lower-level members in mixed parties. Even so—a *great demon*. The experience reward should have been astronomical.\n\n*I never imagined I'd gain less than a single level from that.*\n\nStarting at level 399, the experience requirements had apparently doubled. Or worse.\n\n*Can I even level up through combat anymore?*\n\nThe disturbing thought made Grid pause mid-stitch. He'd been crafting underwear out of habit—his Tailoring proficiency had advanced to the point where he could produce both men's and women's garments with equal skill. To an outside observer, the sight of a man meticulously sewing lingerie might suggest something deeply questionable, but the Overgeared members had long since grown accustomed to the spectacle.\n\n*Those are huge.*\n\n*Jishuka's, obviously.*\n\n*How do you know her size?*\n\n*Well... we lived together for a while.*\n\n*Lucky bastard.*\n\n*...?*\n\nIgnoring the murmured commentary, Grid pulled up his active quest log.\n\n---\n\n**[Tailoring Technique Training]**\n\n**Classification:** Class Quest  \n**Difficulty:** ???\n\n*By learning the Tailoring Technique, your developmental potential has expanded significantly. If you can successfully integrate blacksmithing and tailoring, your foundation as a legendary craftsman will evolve exponentially.*\n\n*However, your current skill level remains insufficient. The gap between Intermediate Tailoring and your legendary blacksmithing abilities is too vast. Attempting to combine them prematurely risks degrading the quality of your legendary works.*\n\n*Advance your Tailoring proficiency to a level where it can harmonize with your blacksmithing mastery.*\n\n**Quest Completion Requirements:** Master Advanced Tailoring Technique  \n**Rewards:** Level +6, Unlock Craftsman-Level Tailoring Technique\n\n---\n\nThis quest was the reason Grid sewed underwear at every available opportunity. The rewards were too valuable to ignore. Initially, he'd coveted the craftsman-level technique itself—imagining the legendary items he could forge with that knowledge. But his perspective had shifted.\n\n*I need to stop focusing on men's underwear.*\n\nThe craftsman-level technique no longer held primary appeal. Once unlocked, he'd certainly apply it to his blacksmithing, but he had no intention of becoming a professional underwear manufacturer. The real treasure lay in a different reward entirely.\n\n*Six levels. Six.*\n\nGaining even one level from hunting a great demon had proven impossible. A quest that granted six levels as a reward? The value was beyond calculation. But rushing to complete it would be foolish.\n\n*The higher my level when I claim the reward, the more valuable those six levels become.*\n\nNo need to delay indefinitely, but no need to hurry either. Grid needed to adopt a more strategic, patient approach.\n\n*What I should focus on right now...*\n\nGrinding out that last 3% to reach level 400. He needed to trigger his fourth stats awakening *before* crafting items from Berith's materials. That order of operations would maximize his gains.\n\n\"Alright. Oh, but first—\" Grid formulated his plan, then called out, \"Sticks!\"\n\n*Is this what kids feel like when they summon Doraemon?* A grin spread across Grid's face. He had complete confidence that Sticks would deliver exactly what he needed.\n\n\"*Haah*... Why are you interrupting my class?\"\n\nSticks served as both principal and head instructor at the Overgeared Academy. A few days ago, he'd provided Grid with long-distance communication earphones developed at Reidan's alchemy facility, allowing them to speak across considerable distances. Grid cut straight to the point.\n\n\"Teleport me to Reidan.\"\n\n\"Why not use the city's warp gate like a normal person...\"\n\n\"That drains Reinhardt's mana reserves. Wasting money.\"\n\n\"Don't I personally recharge Reinhardt's mana core anyway?\"\n\n\"D-do you? See, this is why you're amazing, Sticks!\"\n\n\"*Haha*... **Mass Teleport.**\"\n\nSticks was perpetually busy, dedicating himself to educating the Overgeared Kingdom's youth. Rather than waste time arguing, he simply cast the spell and dispatched Grid to Reidan—a casual expenditure of magic power that ordinary players would never experience in their entire lives.\n\n---\n\n\"Y-Your Majesty! We greet you!!\"\n\nIn the desert city of Reidan, knights sprinted toward the source of the magical disturbance, recognizing Grid the moment he materialized. Chris, who'd been in the castle, arrived seconds later, his expression darkening.\n\n\"You need to send a whisper ahead if you're not using the warp gate. I thought we were under attack.\"\n\n\"Sorry, sorry. I'll definitely remember next time.\" Grid offered an apologetic smile, then strode purposefully toward the alchemy facility.\n\nChris's eyes gleamed with understanding as he fell into step beside Grid. \"Has Berith's Power finally recharged?\"\n\n\"Yep.\" Grid's confident smile widened. \"Time to see what alchemy can really do.\""
