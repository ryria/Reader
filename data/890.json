  "content": "**—I am challenging you to a duel!**\n\nGrid's mind went blank.\n\nIf this were a Hollywood movie, he'd have shouted something profane. Instead, he simply stood there, doubting what he'd just heard.\n\n*A duel?*\n\nHe'd poured gold and effort into building a temple. Hexetia's temple. And this was the response? Not gratitude, but a challenge to combat?\n\n*The affinity went up by fifty points...*\n\nAnd now Hexetia had apparently decided Grid's goodwill was a lie, slashed that affinity to **-10**, and demanded a fight?\n\n*This god is...*\n\nGrid wanted to call Hexetia a lunatic. A capricious bastard who'd just wasted Grid's money and time. But as the initial shock faded, he found he couldn't muster any real anger.\n\nInstead, he felt something unexpected.\n\n*Pity.*\n\nThe inability to accept kindness. The immediate suspicion of good intentions. These weren't the actions of a confident god. Hexetia's self-esteem was buried somewhere beneath the bedrock.\n\n*How long has he lived without love?*\n\nFor a divine being to end up this broken... Grid understood that particular brand of damage all too well. He'd worn those same scars for years.\n\n**—What are you doing? I challenged you to a duel! Answer me!**\n\nHexetia's voice cracked like thunder overhead. Rage saturated every syllable. To anyone else, the mood swing would seem incomprehensible.\n\nBut Grid understood perfectly.\n\n*He thinks I'm ignoring him.*\n\nThe memory hit him like a gut punch—second year of middle school. The day he'd decided he was done being alone. He'd psyched himself up all morning, rehearsing simple greetings in his head. When he finally worked up the courage to say good morning to his classmates...\n\nSilence.\n\nCold stares.\n\nThe pain of being invisible had cut deeper than any insult could have.\n\n*You're feeling that right now, aren't you?*\n\nGrid's jaw tightened as he stared up at the empty blue sky.\n\n**—Still ignoring me! All of you are the same! You humans never... You refuse to show proper respect to a god!**\n\n\"No.\"\n\nGrid's voice cut through the tension. He lifted his head toward Hexetia's unseen presence, meeting the god's words with steady conviction. \"Ignoring you? How could I refuse the challenge of the greatest god who shepherded humanity's rise from nothing?\"\n\nThe sky fell silent.\n\nHexetia had gone quiet, apparently stunned.\n\nThe tens of thousands gathered before the temple began to murmur. Grid had been standing motionless on the stage since announcing the temple's completion. Just staring at nothing. Now he was speaking to empty air.\n\n\"Grid?\" Lauel approached, concern etched on his face. \"Are you alright? If you're not feeling well, just give a quick farewell and step down. I'll have Huroi take over.\"\n\nGrid raised a hand, forestalling him. \"I'm fine.\"\n\nHe ignored the growing confusion among the crowd. Ignored the cameras from a dozen nations pointed at him. His attention remained fixed on the divine presence only he could perceive.\n\n\"The blacksmith god, Hexetia!\" Grid's voice rang out across the plaza. \"He gave humanity fire and iron. Because of Hexetia, civilization rose from barbarism. Blacksmiths learned their craft. I gained the power to stand here today. Without him, there would be no Overgeared Kingdom. If you are human, if you are a blacksmith, if you call yourself a citizen of this kingdom—you owe Hexetia your respect and gratitude.\"\n\n*What the hell is he talking about?*\n\nMost of the players were baffled. Satisfy was a game. The gods were NPCs—fictional constructs of code and story. Praising them like they were real seemed... excessive.\n\nBut some understood.\n\n*He's building favor with the blacksmith god. That's why he built the temple. This is all part of some massive quest chain...*\n\n*Class-specific divine quests give insane rewards. Maybe we'll get access to something similar if we follow his lead?*\n\nHope kindled in many hearts.\n\nThen lightning split the cloudless sky.\n\nThe bolt struck Grid dead center.\n\n\"What—\"\n\n\"The King!\"\n\n\"Keep filming! Don't you dare cut away!\"\n\nChaos erupted. The crowd surged in panic. Soldiers rushed to restore order while knights converged on the stage, weapons drawn against an invisible threat.\n\n\"Grid!\"\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\nThe Overgeared members vaulted onto the platform, searching desperately for their leader.\n\n\"Get those cameras out of here!\"\n\n\"Move!\" \n\nPon, Vantner, and Peak Sword bodily shoved reporters back.\n\nBut Grid was gone.\n\n***\n\n> **[You have been abducted to Asgard: First World!]**\n>\n> **[You are the first player to visit Asgard: First World.]**\n>\n> **[Your location in Asgard cannot be identified. The map has failed to open.]**\n>\n> **[As a reward for being the first to visit Asgard: First World, you have gained the interest of the angels!]**\n>\n> **[The title 'Dipped Your Feet into the World of the Gods' has been acquired.]**\n\n**[Dipped Your Feet into the World of the Gods]**\n\n* Health **+10,000**\n* Altitude Adaptability **+70%**\n\n*You have visited the realm that exists beyond the sky. The pure air fills your lungs with vitality.*\n\nGrid blinked.\n\nOne moment, he'd been on stage. The next, he was... floating. Surrounded by clouds. Not the distant, wispy clouds seen from the ground, but thick, fluffy cumulus that looked softer than the Italian bedding he'd bought his parents.\n\nHe wanted to stretch out and sleep.\n\nThen reality reasserted itself.\n\n\"What the—\"\n\nHis breath seized in his lungs. His limbs felt like they'd been filled with lead.\n\n> **[You are at extreme altitude. The altitude penalty reduces all stats by 100%!]**\n>\n> **[The 'Dipped Your Feet into the World of the Gods' title increases your altitude adaptability by 70%. Altitude penalty reduced to 30%. All stats reduced by 30%.]**\n\n\"Ah...\" The pieces clicked together through the haze of discomfort. \"The duel.\"\n\n*He kidnapped me immediately.*\n\nFirst player to reach the divine realm, and the experience was being *abducted*. Wonderful.\n\n*Hexetia doesn't waste time, does he?*\n\nGrid turned in a slow circle. Golden sunset light painted the horizon in bands of amber and rose. Dozens of rainbows arced through the distant clouds. But there were no mountains, no rivers, no buildings. Just endless sky.\n\n*Now what?*\n\nThen he heard voices.\n\n\"...Look! No wings, no halo! That's a human!\"\n\n\"The gods allowed a *human* to visit?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid followed the sound—young voices, perhaps fifty meters away. The conversation made it clear they weren't mortal. Combined with the quest reward notification...\n\nHe raised his voice, projecting clearly. \"Oh my! I'm a human, and this is my first time in the world of the gods! I have no idea where to go! How do I find God Hexetia?\"\n\nWithin moments, four figures appeared.\n\nBoys and girls with platinum hair and milk-white skin. Pure white wings sprouted from their shoulders, and luminous rings—halos—floated above their heads. Their emerald eyes held depths no mortal jewel could match.\n\nAngels.\n\n*Beautiful.* The word seemed inadequate. Innocence and radiance merged into something almost painful to witness.\n\nWhile Grid stood transfixed, a notification appeared.\n\n> **[Interest of the Young Angels (1)]**\n>\n> *You are the first human the young angels have encountered. They are intensely curious about you. Please answer their questions.*\n>\n> *Quest Clear Conditions: Answer the angels' questions appropriately (3 times total).*\n>\n> *Quest Clear Rewards: Affinity with young angels +1. Link to Interest of the Young Angels (2).*\n>\n> *Quest Failure: The young angels will lose interest in you.*\n\nClassic Satisfy quest chain mechanics. Build affinity through repeated interaction. Even great demons could be befriended this way—eventually. Grid couldn't afford to waste this opportunity.\n\n*Besides, I need help.*\n\nThe cloudscape stretched endlessly in all directions. Without a guide, he'd wander until his inventory ran dry of food.\n\n\"Yes, I'm human. I came here because God Hexetia extended me an invitation.\" He paused, reconsidering. \"Well, more like he abducted me. But I accepted his duel challenge first, so I suppose 'invitation' is accurate.\"\n\nThe angels erupted into excited chatter.\n\n\"Did you hear? God Hexetia invited a human!\"\n\n\"Impossible! God Hexetia hates humans!\"\n\n\"Maybe the human is lying? Humans are good at that!\"\n\n\"If he were lying, he couldn't be here! Only the Seven Malignant Saints can enter Asgard without divine permission!\"\n\n\"Hey.\" Grid tried to cut through the commotion. \"Any other questions?\"\n\nThe angels' excitement was endearing, but he needed to advance the quest before they lost focus.\n\nFortunately, their curiosity remained strong.\n\n\"Can you withstand heat?\"\n\n\"Heat?\" Grid frowned.\n\n\"Yes! God Hexetia is so hot that nobody wants to get near him!\"\n\n\"His fire... um, his fire aura is too intense! Even angels have trouble bearing it!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid's expression softened with sympathy. Alone in the divine realm, he simply nodded. \"I can endure it.\"\n\n*Ttiring~*\n\n> **[Quest successful!]**\n>\n> **[Affinity with young angels increased by 1. Link to Interest of the Young Angels (2) established.]**\n\n**[Interest of the Young Angels (2)]**\n\n*You are the first human the young angels have encountered. They are intensely curious about you. Please answer their questions.*\n\n*Quest Clear Conditions: Answer the angels' questions appropriately (6 times total).*\n\n*Quest Clear Rewards: Affinity with young angels +1. Link to Interest of the Young Angels (3).*\n\n*Quest Failure: The young angels will lose interest in you.*\n\nThe questions continued. What did humans eat? Did they truly die in less than a century? Between the trivial inquiries, Grid gleaned fragments of information about Hexetia's situation in the divine realm.\n\nIt painted a bleak picture.\n\nAfter completing the fifth quest in the chain, a new notification appeared.\n\n> **[Hexetia's Home]**\n>\n> *The young angels have grown fond of you. They will guide you to Hexetia as you requested.*\n\nGrid followed them across the sea of clouds until they reached a shabby cabin. A massive chimney jutted from its roof, belching heat.\n\n\"Too hot... I'm leaving.\"\n\n\"Me too! I don't like God Hexetia!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nChildren's honesty could cut like a blade. The angels' frank rejection would have devastated their target.\n\n> **[The ambient temperature is extremely high.]**\n>\n> **[The Legendary Blacksmith does not succumb to heat.]**\n\nAs soon as the angels departed, the cabin door swung open. Orange letters floated above a half-naked man's head: **Blacksmith God: Hexetia**.\n\nHis exposed chest radiated heat like a forge. The flames dancing across his skin seemed less like power and more like a curse—heat he couldn't control, driving everyone away.\n\nGrid bowed respectfully. \"It's an honor to meet the blacksmith god who elevated humanity from darkness. I accept your duel challenge as a mark of my deep respect.\"\n\n\"You stand before a god without fear.\" Hexetia's voice dripped with bitterness. \"Your respect is clearly false. You exploited my name for your own glory. Now I'll show you the price of blasphemy!\"\n\n> **[★ Hidden Quest ★ 'Win a Blacksmithing Competition with a God' has started!]**\n\n**[Win a Blacksmithing Competition with a God]**\n\n**★ Hidden Quest ★**\n\n*God Hexetia created most of the tools that exist in this world. Victory against him will not come easily.*\n\n*Quest Clear Conditions: Craft an item superior to God Hexetia's creation.*\n\n*Quest Clear Rewards: God Hexetia's acknowledgment and enlightenment. Removal of God Hexetia's envy. Increased affinity with God Hexetia. The curse on the First Holy Sword will be lifted.*\n\n*Quest Failure: Divine punishment.*\n\n*★ Divine punishment may result in severe penalties: character level decrease, skill level decrease, or permanent loss of acquired goods and experience.*"
