Grid chose the long route instead—a ten-day detour that looped through Earl Zebra's lands. The delay didn't bother him.\n\n*Lauel said to stop here and get the Slaughterer's Eye Patch.* The memory of his advisor's voice echoed in his mind. *'Through any means necessary,'* he'd added. That kind of emphasis meant the item had serious value.\n\n*Slaughterer.* Grid rolled the word around in his thoughts. According to Lauel's briefing, the Slaughterer lurked in Earl Zebra's dungeons. The earl's hobby involved torturing half-beasts to death—the kind of twisted pastime that nobles with too much power and too little oversight indulged in.\n\n*But torture has consequences.*\n\nHalf human, half beast. The species could develop either way depending on how they were raised. Earl Zebra's brutality had predictable results. One of his victims had snapped and transformed into something the earl couldn't control anymore.\n\n*I'll know what kind of monster he is when we meet.*\n\nGrid spent four days hunting in the surrounding territory, grinding down his infamy until the stat dropped low enough to allow free movement. Only then did he approach the castle.\n\n***\n\n*This place reeks of death.*\n\nEarl Zebra's fortress loomed ahead. The entrance yawned like a mouth leading into hell itself—dark, desolate, and uninviting. It reminded Grid of every dungeon entrance he'd ever seen, the kind that whispered promises of no return. Most people would've turned around.\n\nGrid kept walking.\n\nHis cowardice had died somewhere between becoming a legend and conquering the National Competition. The man who'd once pissed himself at the sight of ghosts was gone. His self-esteem had grown along with his stats, and fear no longer had the same hold on him.\n\n\"Halt!\" A guard stepped forward, hand on his sword hilt. \"Who goes there?\"\n\nThe soldiers studied Grid's hooded figure with suspicion. He reached up and pulled back the cowl, revealing his face. His Dignity stat exceeded 1,500 points now, backed by 25,000 reputation across the continent. The effect was immediate. Both guards straightened as if struck by lightning, their eyes widening. An almost visible aura seemed to radiate from Grid's presence—something their instincts recognized even if their minds couldn't place it.\n\n\"Sir...\" The first guard's tone shifted entirely. \"From where do you hail?\"\n\nThey'd mistaken him for some high-ranking imperial noble. Grid had seen this transformation before. It barely registered anymore.\n\n\"I came to fight the Slaughterer.\" His voice was flat, matter-of-fact.\n\n\"Gods above.\" The second guard's throat worked as he swallowed hard. *This man wants to fight that thing? Alone?*\n\n\"You're... serious?\" The first guard couldn't hide his disbelief. \"Others have tried with full parties. Groups of ten or more.\"\n\nGrid nodded once. \"I'm serious.\"\n\n***\n\nEarl Zebra's bulk filled his throne like a mound of rising dough. A tenth of a ton of flesh poured over the armrests, his belly straining against silk robes that had cost more than most peasants earned in a year. Grease glistened on his jowls. He stroked his drooping chin and studied Grid with small, calculating eyes.\n\n\"What manner of man are you?\"\n\nThe earl was no genius, but he wasn't stupid either. Born into his title, raised in it, swimming in nobility since birth—he knew how to read people. Years of rubbing elbows with imperial high society had honed that skill. He could taste dignity the way a wine merchant could taste vintage.\n\nThe stranger before him carried himself like royalty. That bearing, that presence... it matched the imperial family.\n\n*But he's not one of them. I'd know.* His mind raced through possibilities. *Why would royalty come here? To fight a monster in my basement? That makes no sense. The royal family are practically gods in this world. They value their safety above all else.*\n\n*A foreign prince, then?*\n\nGrid met his gaze without flinching. \"I'm someone who'll solve your problem. Isn't that enough?\"\n\n\"Ha.\" Earl Zebra's lip curled. The audacity. The sheer nerve of not even offering a name. It grated on him like sand in silk. But he didn't press the issue.\n\n*He'll be dead soon enough.*\n\nThe Slaughterer had evolved six months ago. One of Zebra's regular torture sessions had triggered the transformation. The half-beast had been watching another victim die—a human this time, one of the falsely accused commoners Zebra enjoyed tormenting—when something inside the creature finally snapped. It had grown into something unstoppable, and now that something lived beneath the castle like a cancer.\n\nIt was becoming a serious problem. Zebra had thrown everything at it. His strongest knights. His family's court magicians. Expensive mercenaries. Even adventurers lured by promises of gold. All of them had failed.\n\nOver 800 people had descended into that basement. None had returned. The Slaughterer was simply too strong, and the environment worked against any organized assault. The narrow corridors limited groups to three people maximum. Even his most powerful retainers couldn't coordinate properly in those cramped spaces.\n\nAnd this fool wanted to go alone.\n\n\"Kukukuk. Yes, yes.\" Zebra's laugh was wet and unpleasant. \"I understand. It doesn't matter who you are. Just please, fix my problem.\"\n\nThe quest window materialized in Grid's vision.\n\n> **[Fight the Slaughterer]**\n>\n> **Difficulty:** S+\n>\n> Earl Zebra purchased a half-beast slave years ago and kept it in his dungeons for entertainment. But torture grows stale when your victim can't beg for mercy in words you understand.\n>\n> The earl's tastes evolved. He began framing innocent humans, dragging them to his dungeon, and torturing them to death while the half-beast watched. Day after day, the creature witnessed human suffering. Terror and rage built inside it like pressure in a sealed furnace.\n>\n> Self-preservation instincts finally triggered its transformation. The half-beast became the Slaughterer.\n>\n> The Slaughterer has survived countless tortures. It understands humans intimately. It knows how they break. It knows how they die.\n>\n> The creature is powerful and growing more dangerous. Left unchecked, it will become a catastrophe.\n>\n> **Quest Clear Conditions:** Kill the Slaughterer.\n>\n> **Quest Clear Rewards:** <span class=\"rarity-rare\">Black Quartz Earrings</span>\n>\n> **Quest Failure:** Level -6, Reputation -1,000\n\n*S+ difficulty.*\n\nGrid studied the penalty for a moment. S-grade quests were already brutal. The plus sign meant this one pushed into territory that could break most players. The corridor restriction—only three participants—made it exponentially worse.\n\n*Lauel said even a team of Pon, Regas, and Faker would struggle with this.* He remembered the conversation clearly. Lauel never exaggerated combat assessments. If he said those three would have trouble, he meant it.\n\n*But then he said I could clear it alone.*\n\nLauel was nothing if not precise in his calculations. Grid trusted those calculations.\n\n\"Let's go.\" He turned toward the door.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The soldiers scrambled to guide him.\n\nThey descended through the castle's bowels. The staircase spiraled down for three full minutes, each step taking them deeper into cold stone darkness. The air grew thick and stale. Finally, they reached an iron door bound with chains and a heavy lock. Something breathed on the other side—ragged, animal sounds that made the soldiers' hands shake as they fumbled with the key.\n\n\"H-Here, sir.\" The lock clicked open.\n\nBoth soldiers bolted before the door could swing wide. Their footsteps echoed back up the stairs, fading into silence. Grid stood alone before the entrance to hell.\n\n*No matter how strong you are, you can't be worse than Hell Gao.* The memory of fighting a great demon steadied him. That battle had pushed him to develop new sword techniques. His control had sharpened dramatically since then, thanks to constant sparring with Noe and Randy. This was the strongest version of Grid that had ever existed in Satisfy. The skills he'd demonstrated at the National Competition? That Grid was a shadow of his current self.\n\nStep. Step.\n\nHis footsteps rang against stone as he walked into the basement. Ahead, something massive shifted in the darkness. The breathing grew louder.\n\n**\"KUOOOH!\"**\n\nThe Slaughterer shambled into the torchlight, and Grid's jaw tightened.\n\nThe creature was a monument to suffering. Skin hung in ragged strips where it had been peeled away. Rusted metal shards jutted from its flesh like horrible piercings, embedded so deep they'd become part of its body. Chunks of meat hung in the wrong places—evidence of amateur surgery or deliberate mutilation. It wore a cracked iron mask, and an eye patch covered one socket. The remaining eye burned with decades of accumulated hatred.\n\n\"Poor bastard.\" Grid's voice was quiet. \"I'll make this quick. You've suffered enough.\"\n\nHe drew both greatswords. Blue orichalcum gleamed in his right hand. Jade shone in his left.\n\n> [**+9 Failure** has been equipped.]\n>\n> [Due to the effect of orichalcum, damage is increased by 30% in dark places.]\n>\n> [**+8 Doppelganger's Greatsword** has been equipped.]\n>\n> [50% of weapon attack power is applied due to dual-wielding penalty.]\n\n**\"KUAAAAAH!\"**\n\nThe Slaughterer roared. The sight of weapons triggered something primal in its broken mind—memories of torture, of blades cutting into flesh, of pain that never stopped. Its massive frame surged forward.\n\n> [The Slaughterer's cry has inflicted **Fear**.]\n>\n> [You resisted.]\n>\n> [The Slaughterer's gaze is searching for weaknesses.]\n>\n> [You resisted.]\n\n**KUNG! KUNG!**\n\nThe monster charged, weapon swinging in wide, desperate arcs. No technique. No thought. Just pure animal fury translated into violence.\n\n*Crude.* Grid had fought Randy 83 times. Randy, who could copy Pagma's techniques with terrifying accuracy. Randy, who forced him to evolve with every bout. Compared to that training, the Slaughterer's attacks were telegraphed and clumsy.\n\n**CHENGKANG!**\n\nThe jade greatsword intercepted the creature's weapon mid-swing, deflecting it to the side.\n\n**PUOK!**\n\nThe blue greatsword punched through the Slaughterer's chest. Not a clean pierce. Grid twisted the blade, grinding it through ribs and organs, using the weapon like a drill to maximize internal damage.\n\n**\"KUAAAANG!\"**\n\nThe Slaughterer's scream was almost human—a child's wail of agony. Grid ripped Failure free in a spray of corruption and immediately flowed into his next strike. The jade sword carved low, hamstringing the creature. The blue sword rose high, wreathed in light.\n\n\"**Pinnacle.**\"\n\nThe technique crashed down like divine judgment. The blade split the Slaughterer's chest cavity open. Rotten blood mixed with yellow pus erupted from the wound, painting the basement wall in diseased viscera.\n\nThe creature's remaining eye rolled with pure hate. *Why?* it seemed to scream. *Why must I always suffer? I never asked to be born a monster!*\n\nIts weapon fell toward Grid's skull in a last desperate attack.\n\n**CHAAENG!**\n\nRandy materialized beside him—a perfect copy wearing Grid's face. The doppelganger executed Revolve with mechanical precision, catching the attack in a vortex of deflection and turning the Slaughterer's own momentum against it.\n\n\"Let's finish this.\" Grid's voice was cold.\n\n**Suuuk.**\n\nSeven golden blades spread through the air like a fan. Pavranium shone brilliantly against the basement's oppressive darkness. The blades dove as one, each seeking a vital point.\n\n\"I'm going to eat! Nyang!\" Noe burst from Grid's shadow.\n\nThe Memphis's jaws opened impossibly wide and swallowed the Slaughterer whole. The creature's outline bulged inside Noe's form for a moment before dissolving into raw statistics.\n\n> [**Strength** has increased by 1,831.]\n\nPower flooded Grid's limbs. He channeled it immediately into his final technique, both swords moving as one.\n\n\"**Pagma's Swordsmanship—Linked Kill!**\"\n\nThe Doppelganger's Greatsword's unique option activated, boosting skill damage by 20%. Failure's five-joint-attack proc triggered. The Holy Light Gloves added their multiplier. Three separate amplifications stacked into a single moment of overwhelming violence.\n\nLinked Kill became his strongest skill reborn.\n\n> [You have defeated **The Slaughterer**.]\n>\n> [108,950,109 experience has been acquired.]\n>\n> [One-third of experience has been distributed to **Noe**.]\n>\n> [One-third of experience has been distributed to **Randy**.]\n>\n> [<span class=\"rarity-unique\">Slaughterer's Eye Patch</span> has been acquired.]\n>\n> [<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Slaughterer's Mask</span> has been acquired.]\n>\n> [Three **Weapon Enhancement Stones** have been acquired.]\n>\n> [One **Blessed Weapon Enhancement Stone** has been acquired.]\n\nThe Slaughterer's eternal torment ended in silence. Grid bent to examine the dropped items and immediately understood why Lauel had insisted he make this detour.\n\nThe Eye Patch pulsed with potential in his hand.\n\n***\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms**\n\n**OG:** [Glossary Link]\n\n*Current schedule: 20 chapters a week.*\n\n*Check out my Patreon for early access to unedited chapters and to help achieve goals for extra chapters.
