  "content": "The drake folded its wings and plummeted toward Grid like a missile.\n\nThe broadcast booth erupted.\n\n\"Grid's in trouble!\" The first commentator leaned forward in his seat. \"That drake's closing fast. His posture is completely off. There's no way he avoids this.\"\n\n\"He can't even use a skill while falling.\" The second commentator shook his head. \"Pagma's Swordsmanship requires footwork. The more I watch it, the more limitations I see in those techniques.\"\n\nA third voice cut in. \"Why didn't he use Revolve? A proper counter here would have swung the momentum entirely in his favor.\"\n\n\"Because he couldn't.\" The first commentator pulled up a replay on his tablet. \"Getting the timing right on a counterattack is brutally difficult. Grid countering Bondre's spell was more luck than skill, frankly. Counterattacks are near-impossible to pull off consistently. Who else besides Kraugel can do it freely?\"\n\nNo one doubted Grid's ability. Every analyst acknowledged his skill. But the drake held the advantage. It fought with precision, and its raw power eclipsed Grid's current state. Defeat seemed inevitable.\n\n\"Grid!\"\n\nYura's scream cut through the arena.\n\nPeak Sword and the other Korean representatives surged forward. They fired everything they had at the descending drake. Peak Sword's blade bit deep enough to draw blood, but the creature didn't even flinch. The others' attacks splashed harmlessly against scales. The drake's aggro remained locked on Grid, its trajectory unaltered.\n\nThe distance closed.\n\n**Kurarararara!**\n\nFire wreathed the drake's body as it reached for Grid. Its maw opened wide, revealing rows of jagged fangs. The commentators were already writing the eulogy.\n\nBut Grid smiled.\n\n\"You can't kill me.\"\n\n**Puok!**\n\nA trident punched through the back of the drake's neck.\n\n**Kieeeeeeek—!**\n\nThe drake shrieked. Its eyes widened in shock, but rage overrode pain. It ignored the metal buried in its spine and lunged for Grid's throat.\n\nThe rope went taut.\n\nThe drake's head snapped backward. Its claws swiped empty air three meters from Grid's face. The creature thrashed against the restraint, flames erupting from its nostrils in fury.\n\nGrid hung in the air, falling in slow motion. Above him, four golden hands orbited in a tight formation. The God Hands had worked in silence throughout the battle. One gripped the <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Dragon Hammer</span>, methodically pounding the <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Dragon Harpoon</span>'s pillar deeper into the platform below. The other three had assembled something new.\n\nThey flew to Grid. The largest hand extended a weapon.\n\nTwo blades merged into one. A shark-shaped greatsword of brilliant blue fused with a crescent longsword. Light erupted from the seam where they joined.\n\n> [<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Failure + Efficient Hunting Sword (Combined)</span>]\n> \n> **Rating:** Legendary (Transcendent)  \n> **Durability:** Infinite  \n> **Attack Power:** 1,500~2,180  \n> **Bonus Attack Power:** +120  \n> \n> * Agility **+100**\n> * Certain probability of blocking enemy attacks\n> * Certain probability of activating **'5 Joint Attacks'**\n> * High probability of activating **'Cutting'**\n> * **+40%** damage vs monsters\n> * **+60%** critical rate vs monsters\n> * **+30%** item drop rate from monsters\n> * Fear effect (enemies 15+ levels lower)\n> * **+30%** attack power in darkness\n> \n> *A weapon that maximizes the merits of the legendary rated 'Failure' and 'Efficient Hunting Sword' after being combined by the legendary blacksmith G.*\n> \n> **Conditions of Use:** Pagma's Descendant  \n> **Combination Time:** 2 minutes  \n> ***This item cannot be traded.***\n\n*I made two for a reason.*\n\nGrid had crafted a second <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Efficient Hunting Sword</span> chasing the dream of a legendary rating. Both attempts had fallen short, stopping at unique. But in this moment, those \"failures\" became something greater.\n\n**Kurarararal!**\n\nThe drake flailed against the harpoon. Grid's hands moved with practiced efficiency. The <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Largest Gloves</span> vanished into inventory. The <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Holy Light Gloves</span> materialized in their place, golden light pulsing across his knuckles.\n\nThe sun touched the horizon. Shadows stretched across the arena floor like grasping fingers. Darkness pooled beneath the drake.\n\n*Perfect.*\n\nGrid had calculated this from the moment the raid began. He'd delayed Item Combination for two reasons. First, to maximize <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Failure's</span> bonus in darkness. Second, to create a weakness where none existed.\n\n\"Die.\" Grid's voice was cold. \"Leave me your leather. Your bones. Your teeth and claws. Your heart, your eyes. Everything.\"\n\nThe drake wasn't an enemy anymore. It was materials. It was profit. It was **his**.\n\n**Taack!**\n\nGrid launched himself forward. Dark energy coiled around his body like smoke, beautiful and terrible.\n\n**Kuwaaah!**\n\nThe drake struggled. Its roar was no longer proud. Fear leaked into the sound. It yanked against the harpoon with desperate strength, but the God Hand never stopped hammering. Each strike drove the pillar deeper. The <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Dragon Harpoon's</span> infinite durability meant one simple truth.\n\nThis binding was eternal.\n\n\"Hiyah!\"\n\nThe <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Slaughterer's Eye Patch</span> revealed the world in sharp clarity. A single point on the drake's forehead glowed like a beacon. The exact spot Grid had struck repeatedly throughout the fight. A weak point, cultivated through strategy.\n\n\"Pinnacle Kill.\"\n\nThe skill name left his lips as a whisper. Killing intent solidified into physical force. The combined blade became a streak of light in the gathering darkness.\n\n> [**Critical Hit!**]\n\n> [**Weak spot attacked! Bonus damage applied!**]\n\n> [<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Holy Light Gloves</span> option activated. Skill **'5 Joint Attacks'** generated.]\n\n> [<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Failure + Efficient Hunting Sword (Combined)</span> option activated.

Skill **'Cutting'** generated.]\n\n> [**You have dealt 21,300,590 damage to the target.**]\n\n> [**A player has dealt 20 million damage in one blow for the first time!**]\n\n> [**Title: 'Death in One Shot' has been acquired.**]\n\n> [**The passive '30% increase in critical strike damage' will always be applied.**]\n\n> [**The savage drake has died and returned to the soil.**]\n\n> [**Your level has risen.**]\n\n> [**Party leader 'Grid' has acquired drake fangs (2).**]\n\n> [**Party leader 'Grid' has acquired drake claws (4).**]\n\n> [**Party leader 'Grid' has acquired drake scales (6).**]\n\n> [**Party leader 'Grid' has acquired drake bones (10).**]\n\n> [**Party leader 'Grid' has acquired a drake heart (1).**]\n\n**Kuuuuuuong!**\n\nThe drake's corpse hit the arena floor like a felled tree. Its health bar hadn't even dropped to half. One strike. Twenty-one million damage. Dead.\n\nSilence.\n\nThe commentators stared at their screens. Their prepared analysis evaporated. In the stadium, ten thousand mouths hung open. Around the world, two hundred million viewers forgot to breathe.\n\nThe Korean representatives stood frozen. Not from shock at the kill itself, but from something else entirely.\n\n*When did he change the loot settings?*\n\nNobody had noticed. They'd been too focused on Grid's dance with death to see the God Hands working in the corner. Too mesmerized by the spectacle to catch Grid's fingers flicking through menu screens mid-combat.\n\nThat was the difference between good and great.\n\n---\n\n> [**The savage drake has died and returned to the soil.**]\n\nFourteen minutes after the raid began, the American team's drake collapsed.\n\n\"YES!\" Zibal pumped his fist.\n\n\"Gold medal!\" Another representative jumped. \"We've got the gold!\"\n\nRelief and pride flooded the American booth. They'd feared Russia would edge them out. This medal meant everything.\n\nBut Lauel's expression remained flat.\n\n*Even when I barely helped.*\n\nHe'd offered minimal input during the strategy meeting. His excuse had been humility. \"I'm not a raid specialist.\" The truth was uglier. Lauel had wanted America to fail. He'd kept silent about methods to ground the drake, ways to exploit its attack patterns.\n\nThe problem was Zibal. The man's raid sense bordered on precognition. He'd crafted a winning strategy in real-time, leveraging each team member's strengths with surgical precision. Fourteen minutes and thirty-three seconds. A dominant performance.\n\n*Twenty minutes. If they'd just taken eighteen minutes.*\n\nGrid might have finished first. Lauel exhaled and reached for the logout command. Around him, Zibal disconnected with a grin splitting his face.\n\n*Finally. I've proven I'm not just a punching bag.*\n\nWeak in PvP? Sure. But raids were his domain. Nobody could touch him there. Zibal climbed from his capsule and waited for the roar of the crowd.\n\nScattered applause. Polite. Confused.\n\n*They're stunned. Too shocked to react properly.*\n\nThe American team had demolished a supposedly impossible boss. The audience needed time to process. Zibal's shoulders shook with suppressed laughter. Any second now, the announcement would come.\n\n\"At fourteen minutes and thirty-three seconds, Team USA has successfully raided the savage drake and won... the silver medal!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThe word came out strangled. Around Zibal, his teammates froze. Lauel's head snapped toward the scoreboard.\n\n**South Korea: 8 minutes and 59 seconds.**\n\n\"...\"\n\nImpossible. Japan with Damian's buffs, maybe. But South Korea? Grid, Peak Sword, and their collection of mid-tier players? Nine minutes?\n\n\"This is fake!\" Zibal's face flushed crimson. \"There's no way! Check for tampering!\"\n\nHis voice cracked on the last word. Desperation leaked through. The accusation hung in the air for three seconds.\n\nThen the jumbotron switched feeds.\n\nThe highlight reel began. Grid's raid. Frame by frame, second by second.\n\nThe American representatives watched in silence. Jaws went slack. Eyes glazed. The impossible played out in high definition.\n\n\"Hahat!\" Lauel's laughter shattered the quiet. \"Puhahahat!\"\n\nHe doubled over, gasping. Tears streamed down his face. The other Americans stared at him like he'd lost his mind.\n\nBut Lauel understood. Only he truly understood.\n\nGrid hadn't just won. He'd **obliterated** the concept of competition itself."
