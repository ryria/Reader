Grid leaned against the trunk of an old oak, watching Irene trace patterns on his palm.\n\n\"Husband.\" She smiled, the word still foreign on her tongue.\n\nSix months. It had been half a year since they'd last seen each other. Irene's fingers laced through his, squeezing tight as if he might disappear.\n\n\"I keep thinking I'll wake up,\" she whispered. \"That this is just another dream.\"\n\nHer joy was palpable—and it gutted him. \n\n*I made her wait too long.* Grid's jaw tightened. *I should take her to Reidan. She belongs with me.*\n\nBut Winston needed its Lady. The city couldn't function without her.\n\n\"I love you.\" Irene pressed closer.\n\n\"I love you too.\"\n\nTheir embrace deepened. The loneliness of separation made this reunion all the more precious. Grid buried his face against her shoulder, breathing in the scent of her hair.\n\n\"This parenting system,\" he murmured. \"It's surreal.\"\n\nIrene guided his hand to the swell of her stomach. Through the fabric, Grid felt warmth—and then, faint but unmistakable, a rhythmic pulse.\n\n*Thump-thump. Thump-thump.*\n\nA heartbeat. His child's heartbeat.\n\nThe sound struck him like a physical blow. Fear coiled in his chest—he had no idea how to be a father. But beneath the terror lay something else. Something vast and overwhelming.\n\n*My child. I'm going to be a father.*\n\nHe pressed his ear against her belly, listening. The tiny, determined rhythm continued.\n\n*Last year, I had nothing. No money. No friends. I was alone.*\n\nNow he had colleagues. A guild. A woman he loved. A home.\n\n*Satisfy gave me all of this. It's not just a game anymore.*\n\nIrene's small hand cupped his face, her touch gentle. \"I want our child to be a boy,\" she said. \"With kind hands like yours. Don't you?\"\n\nHer voice carried an undertone Grid recognized—the bitterness of a noblewoman who understood her world too well. The Eternal Kingdom treated women better than southern nations, but noble inheritance still favored sons. Marquis Steim had wanted a son. Irene knew that.\n\nGrid caught her wrist, holding her gaze. \"I want a daughter.\"\n\nShe blinked. \"But... for an heir, a daughter is—\"\n\n\"I don't care about inheritance.\" His thumb traced circles on her palm. \"I want a daughter. Someone as beautiful and kind as you.\"\n\nHe meant it. Every word.\n\nIrene's eyes glistened. Color rose in her cheeks as tears spilled over. \"You're too good to me.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe flush on her face, the moisture in her eyes—Grid's throat went dry. Irene saw his expression shift. Her lips curved.\n\n\"I love you.\" She leaned in, voice dropping to a whisper. \"The baby makes it difficult, but... there are other ways.\"\n\n\"Wait, what—\"\n\n\"Come.\" She stood, pulling him toward the manor.\n\nGrid stumbled after her, face burning. For all her innocence, Irene still had the capacity to catch him completely off-guard.\n\n---\n\nThe bedroom door closed behind them. What followed was tender and careful, adapted to Irene's condition.\n\nWhen they finally lay still, a notification appeared.\n\n> [The child in the belly has felt the couple's true love.]\n> \n> [All stats of the child in the belly will permanently increase by one.]\n\n---\n\nTen days. That was all the time Grid had left in Winston.\n\nLauel's whisper came through late one evening. *The merger ceremony with the Silver Knights Guild is scheduled. We need you back in Reidan.*\n\nGrid sat on the edge of the bed, watching Irene sleep. Three days together. It wasn't enough. It would never be enough.\n\n*If I had my own kingdom, I'd make her my queen. No one could separate us then.*\n\nAnother reason to claim a crown.\n\nFootsteps approached from the hall. Phoenix appeared in the doorway, his weathered face serious. \"Duke Grid. A word?\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Can you take Lady Irene with you to Reidan?\"\n\nGrid straightened. \"She can leave Winston?\"\n\n\"Marquis Steim has arranged for a substitute administrator.\" Phoenix's expression softened. \"He wants his daughter close to family when the child is born. She shouldn't be alone.\"\n\n\"Then yes. Absolutely.\" Relief flooded through him. Grid grinned, the tension draining from his shoulders.\n\nPhoenix smiled, his eyes crinkling. *You truly love her, my Lady. Hold onto this man.*\n\n---\n\n\"Ready?\" Grid wrapped his arms around Irene's waist.\n\nShe nodded, breathless with anticipation. Blue light flared from his boots—Braham's magic surging to life. They lifted off the ground.\n\nIrene gasped as the earth fell away. Clouds parted around them. Wind whipped through her hair.\n\n\"It's like a fairy tale,\" she breathed. \"Flying through the sky...\"\n\n\"Every moment with you is a fairy tale.\"\n\nShe turned her head, kissing his cheek. \"Husband...\"\n\n> [The child in the belly has felt the couple's true love.]\n> \n> [All stats of the child in the belly will permanently increase by one.]\n> \n> [The child in the belly has witnessed the marvels of nature.]\n> \n> [The child in the belly is curious.]\n> \n> [The intelligence of the child in the belly will permanently increase by two.]\n\n\"Mana's running low.\" Grid descended gradually, touching down in a forest clearing. \"We'll walk for a bit.\"\n\n\"This reminds me of when we first met.\" Irene took his hand as they started along the path. \"You rescued me from Malacus. We walked through a forest just like this.\"\n\n*That feels like a lifetime ago.*\n\nGrid pulled her close, his arm around her shoulders. \"No danger will reach you again. I swear it.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n> [The child in the belly has felt the couple's true love.]\n> \n> [All stats of the child in the belly will permanently increase by one.]\n\nThe journey to Reidan took days. Monsters emerged from the underbrush—desert toads, canyon wolves, the occasional bandit gang. Grid cut them down without breaking stride, his swordsmanship fluid and effortless.\n\nEach battle triggered new notifications.\n\n> [The child in the belly has witnessed his father's sword dance and admires it.]\n> \n> [The child in the belly is interested in swordsmanship.]\n> \n> [The strength of the child in the belly will permanently increase by one.]\n\nDuring breaks, Grid would repair his equipment. Irene sat nearby, watching him work the metal.\n\n> [The child in the belly has witnessed his father's weapon repairing and admires it.]\n> \n> [The child in the belly is interested in blacksmithing.]\n> \n> [The dexterity of the child in the belly will permanently increase by one.]\n\n*This is absurd.* Grid stared at the latest window. *Normal level 1 characters start with 22 stat points. My kid's going to have 50 before they're even born.*\n\nThen again, stat caps mattered more than starting values. Most NPCs hit hard limits on their growth. Named NPCs were the exception.\n\n*As long as the baby's healthy. That's what matters.*\n\nHe glanced at Irene, humming softly as she walked. *If they're anything like her, I'll be happy.*\n\nWhat Grid didn't consider—what he couldn't yet know—was that his child carried the blood of two exceptional individuals. A legendary blacksmith. A marquis of the Eternal Kingdom.\n\nThe combination would prove... significant.\n\n---\n\n**Guild Name:** Overgeared  \n**Level:** 10 (MAX)  \n**Master:** Grid  \n**Capacity:** 28/250  \n**Affiliation:** The Eternal Kingdom  \n**Alliances:** Marquis Steim  \n**Hostile Relationships:** No clear enemies, but many wary factions  \n**Inclination:** Unconditionally favorable with Marquis Steim  \n**Territory:** Reidan\n\nReaching level 10 normally took top guilds over a year of grinding. Overgeared had done it in seven months, fueled by the insane rewards from the golem invasion.\n\nGrid scowled at his interface. \"Why the hell is the cap 250 members? This guild system is garbage.\"\n\nThe Silver Knights Guild had 225 members. The merger agreement included all of them. That meant Overgeared was about to exceed capacity.\n\nLauel sighed. \"You create a second guild.\"\n\n\"One person can make multiple guilds?\"\n\n\"No. Someone already in Overgeared forms a new guild and links it to ours. A subsidiary.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Grid blinked. \"So that's how the big guilds manage thousands of members?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Lauel's eye twitched. *How did you not know this? It's basic knowledge.*\n\n\"Fine. Make a second guild then.\"\n\n\"I can't. I'm already an executive in Overgeared.\" Lauel turned to Jishuka. \"You were the master of the Tzedakah Guild—Overgeared's predecessor. You're the logical choice to lead the second guild.\"\n\nJishuka frowned, arms crossed. \"I'm already managing Bairan. I don't have time for another responsibility.\"\n\n\"Over the past six months, our members have learned territorial administration. Plenty of people can handle Bairan in your absence. Don't worry.\"\n\n\"...\" She exhaled slowly. \"Fine. If someone can cover Bairan, I'll do it.\"\n\nThe guild gathered in Reidan's central plaza. Jishuka pulled up her interface, initiating the guild creation sequence.\n\n\"What should we call it?\" someone asked.\n\nAll eyes turned to Grid.\n\nHe thought for exactly three seconds. \"Overgeared Two.\"\n\n\"For fuck's sake!\" Lauel exploded. \"The second and third guilds are named according to their function! The second guild will focus on production and support classes. Name it based on that!\"\n\n\"Overgeared Workforce?\"\n\n\"I give up.\" Lauel dragged a hand down his face. \"I actually give up.\"\n\nThe Overgeared members exchanged glances. Then they shrugged. They'd grown accustomed to Grid's naming sense.\n\nJishuka created the guild. The name was registered.\n\n**Overgeared Two.**\n\nLauel looked like he wanted to cry.\n\n---\n\nThe day of the merger arrived.\n\nPeak Sword led the Silver Knights Guild across the desert. Two hundred and twenty-five members marched in formation, their banners snapping in the wind. Peak Sword—ranked 15th on the unified rankings—cut down any monster foolish enough to approach.\n\nWhen the gates of Reidan came into view, the Silver Knights stopped.\n\n\"Holy shit,\" someone whispered.\n\nReidan had transformed. Buildings rose in organized rows. The walls gleamed with fresh stone. Soldiers patrolled in formation, equipped with Mass Production Grid Sets. Alchemy facilities lined the eastern district. Agricultural fields stretched for miles to the west.\n\nThis was the result of 20 million gold—invested, allocated, and spent with Lauel's meticulous planning.\n\n\"Welcome to Reidan.\"\n\nGrid stood at the gate. Behind him, nearly 30 Overgeared members formed a line. Rankers. Famous players. Powerhouses.\n\nThe Silver Knights Guild stared. In a matter of minutes, they would become part of this.\n\nPeak Sword stepped forward. He dropped to one knee. \"Master. I look forward to working under you.\"\n\nHe was older than Grid in reality. He knew that. But in Satisfy, Grid's status was leagues above his own. This gesture would set the tone—respect for the hierarchy.\n\nGrid extended a hand, pulling Peak Sword to his feet. \"I'm looking forward to it too.\"\n\nThis moment—the ignored, debt-ridden loser becoming the master of a powerful guild—would be a defining scene if anyone ever made a documentary about Grid's life.\n\nBut the smooth moment didn't last.\n\n\"Duke Grid!\" Minor sprinted toward them, waving frantically. \"We have a problem!\"\n\nGrid's smile faded. *Of course we do.*"
