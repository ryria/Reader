  "content": "He understood the concept of worry—intellectually, at least. But fear for himself? That was beyond him. His existence had been forged with a single, unshakeable purpose.\n\nThe dimensional gate writhed before him, magic power churning in its depths.\n\nHis steps echoed in the empty hall as he approached. No hesitation. No doubt.\n\nBaal's voice slithered through his mind. *Poor creature. The world beyond that door is the true hell. No one will welcome you there. Only pain and solitude await. And yet—will you still cross?*\n\n\"Do the great demons here welcome me?\"\n\n*They do not welcome you... but at least they don't hate you. They merely fear you.*\n\n\"Irrelevant.\" The clone's voice held no emotion. \"Grid isn't here.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air. He'd nearly added more—*I don't know how to feel anything but pain and solitude*—but something stopped him. He couldn't say why.\n\n*Kukuku...* Baal's laughter rolled through the darkness. *Yes. Go, then. Show me what awaits at the end of your fleeting life—this existence with only one purpose. I will savor every moment of your pain, your loneliness, your despair.*\n\nThe clone was already through the gate.\n\nReality twisted. The universe sprawled before him in all its terrible infinity, and then—\n\nWater. The Red Sea stretched in every direction.\n\nHe surfaced at the world's center and dismissed Blackening. The dark energy peeled away from his armor.\n\n\"Grid...\"\n\nHis eyes—Grid's eyes—fixed on the western horizon.\n\n***\n\n[You have suffered catastrophic damage!]\n\n[A legend doesn't die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]\n\nYura's cheek pressed against cold stone, her health bar a sliver of red.\n\n*Damn it.*\n\nWhen Satisfy had launched years ago, she'd recognized it immediately—not just as a game, but as a revolution. A world where talent and skill mattered more than bloodlines and family names. She'd thrown herself into it with everything she had, determined to carve out an identity beyond \"the rich girl with the successful parents.\"\n\nAnd she'd succeeded. Top five worldwide. A household name. Money, fame, freedom—everything she'd fought for.\n\nThen she'd met Kraugel, and understood what true genius looked like.\n\nHer pride had taken a blow, sure. But Satisfy was a *game*. She could evolve her class, optimize her build, close that gap. She'd pursued power relentlessly—even courting Yatan's darkness in her desperation to break through her limits.\n\nAnd then Grid had shattered her in one hit.\n\nYears of training. A legendary class. All that struggle—and here she was, knocked flat by a man so far beyond her that he *apologized* for it.\n\n\"I-It's the power of items. I'm sorry.\"\n\nYura stared at the ground.\n\n\"You're not weak, I'm just overgeared... A-Are you okay?\"\n\nGrid was *fretting*. Like she was fragile. Like she wasn't a competitor at all, just some... some *novice* who needed coddling.\n\nDid he treat Kraugel like this? No. Kraugel got respect. Acknowledgment. This? This was pity.\n\n\"I know I'm not weak.\" Yura ignored his offered hand and pushed herself up, her jaw tight. \"I wasn't even ready. That was just an experiment. If this were a real fight, I'd have used my defensive skills. You wouldn't have touched me.\"\n\n\"Ah, t-that's right.\"\n\nWas she actually pouting? Grid blinked at her, caught off-guard. He'd always thought of Yura as untouchable—composed, intellectual, impossibly distant. But right now, with her cheeks flushed and her pride clearly wounded...\n\n*She looks younger.*\n\nThree years his junior, but she usually carried herself with such maturity that he forgot. Now, seeing genuine emotion flash across her face—\n\n*Cute.*\n\nHis racing heartbeat steadied. The beautiful woman who usually made him nervous suddenly seemed... approachable. Almost adorable in her indignation.\n\nWatching from nearby, Jishuka's eye twitched. \"...That fox.\"\n\nGrid's expression shifted abruptly. *What are you doing here?*\n\nA whisper—Euphemina.\n\n*Your Majesty, why are you in Juden?*\n\n\"Where's Juden?\" Grid spun toward Lauel.\n\n\"The Murray Kingdom's capital. A sea nation at the Red Sea's edge.\"\n\n\"The clone's there.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nYura straightened, her embarrassment forgotten. \"It's a path between the surface and hell.\"\n\nGrid's hands moved through whisper commands. *That isn't me! It's the enemy! Get out of there right now!*\n\nThe response came broken, distorted: *Sir Asmophel is already—*\n\n*Euphemina? Euphemina!*\n\nSilence.\n\n***\n\n\"...Grid?\"\n\nEuphemina stared at the black-haired figure striding through Juden's central square.\n\nThis didn't make sense. Why would the Overgeared King personally travel to this remote corner of the world? And why now, when—\n\n*Sir Asmophel is on a mission to find former Red Knights.*\n\nGrid had no reason to be here. He was too busy, too important to chase down Asmophel's scattered leads. Which meant...\n\n\"Y-Your Majesty?\" Asmophel sounded equally confused. \"Why are you here?\"\n\nNo answer. Grid—if it was Grid—didn't even glance in their direction. He walked with mechanical purpose, ignoring the attention, the questions, the growing unease.\n\nEuphemina's eyes narrowed. The equipment looked *wrong*. Familiar, yes, but—\n\n*Those are his old items. Years old. Weathered and rusted.*\n\nGrid was a master blacksmith. He'd never let his gear decay like that. He'd—\n\n*That isn't me! It's the enemy! Get out of there right now!*\n\nThe whisper hit her like ice water.\n\n\"What—\"\n\nSteel flashed. Asmophel had moved—his blade punched through Grid's back.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Asmophel's voice was cold. \"An evil demon, daring to wear His Majesty's face—*ugh!*\"\n\nA golden fist struck him like a siege weapon. Asmophel flew backward and crumpled against the street, blood streaming from his nose.\n\nGod Hands. The clone had God Hands.\n\n*Old equipment. God Hands. What is this thing?*\n\n\"Interesting.\" Haster straightened, his tactical mind already racing. \"A fake Grid... I wonder how he measures up to the real thing?\"\n\n\"Kik... I'm busy...\" Agnus melted into the crowd's confusion.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Drop your weapon!\"\n\nThe Murray Kingdom's soldiers formed ranks, spears leveled. Singuled had already fought himself to exhaustion—now it was their turn to defend the capital.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship, Wave.\"\n\nSword energy exploded outward.\n\nGolden shields materialized in dozens—*hundreds*—blocking the wave before it could reach flesh. The caster stood on a nearby roof, her expression sharp.\n\n\"Don't.\" Euphemina's voice cut through the chaos. \"I won't let you damage Grid's reputation.\"\n\nThe clone's head snapped toward her. \"Judgment. Dangerous.\"\n\nHe launched himself at the roof.\n\nEuphemina met him with duplicated skills and conjured barriers, their clash igniting in a storm of light and steel that made even Singuled and Asmophel's earlier duel look tame."
