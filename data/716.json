  "content": "Among all the player parties assembled in Satisfy's history, one stood above the rest: the Belial Raid party. Grid, the Overgeared Guild's elite rankers, Sword Saint Kraugel, and Pope Damian—a constellation of power that experts unanimously declared would never be matched.\n\nYet here they were, proving the experts wrong.\n\n[The party 'Let's Obtain Loot!' has conquered the 8th vampire city!]\n[Party Leader 'Grid' has acquired two Advanced Vampire Rings.]\n[Party Leader 'Grid' has acquired a Stamina Elixir.]\n[Party Leader 'Grid'...]\n\nOne hour, forty-eight minutes. After crushing the 9th city in just under two hours, they'd shattered their own record. This was the strength of a guild-forged party—warriors united by purpose, moving as one mind.\n\n\"We're unstoppable, aren't we?\" someone laughed.\n\n\"With this roster? No chance we lose.\"\n\nThe current lineup rivaled even the legendary Belial raid. Chris matched Kraugel's combat prowess. Saintess Ruby, though only level 200, wielded percentage-based heals and divine power with devastating efficiency in group combat. True, her individual strength couldn't match Damian's, and her buff repertoire remained limited, but her specialized abilities more than compensated.\n\nMore crucially, the entire roster had grown exponentially since the Belial raid. Most now wielded weapons forged from Belial's very essence.\n\n\"Lauel thinks we could take Belial now,\" someone noted.\n\n\"Probably right.\"\n\nLaughter rippled through the ranks.\n\nThe 9th and 8th cities had fallen easier than expected. Morale soared. The spoils alone justified the expedition—Advanced Vampire Rings and permanent stat elixirs.\n\nThese weren't ordinary drops. While inferior to Grid's personal ring from Elfin Stone, Advanced Vampire Rings stood in a class of their own. Healing effects. Life-steal mechanics. In all of Satisfy, no substitute existed. Even among Overgeared's veterans, most wore lesser versions. The drop rate saw to that.\n\nAs for the elixirs—permanent increases of ten to any stat—Chris, Lord of Reidan, had consumed exactly three since claiming his territory. Astronomical didn't begin to cover their value. Yet they'd harvested multiple elixirs from just two cities.\n\n\"Luck's on our side. We'll emerge from this expedition transformed.\"\n\nExcitement electrified the party. Everyone glimpsed a brilliant future.\n\nEveryone except Grid.\n\n*...Something's wrong.*\n\nDread coiled in his gut, cold and inexplicable. They were too lucky. Elixirs he'd spent years failing to find suddenly dropping in succession? Grid had tasted fortune before—this felt different.\n\n*Three true blood vampires in the 9th city simultaneously.*\n\nUnusual, yes, but not unprecedented. Tiramet's city had fielded multiple true bloods alongside their direct descendant. Logic suggested nothing amiss. Yet the unease refused to dissipate.\n\n*What if Marie Rose isn't confined to the 2nd city...?*\n\nNo. He trusted Braham's intelligence.\n\n*But what if multiple direct descendants appear together?*\n\nYears of misfortune had honed his instincts for disaster.\n\nGoosebumps prickled across his skin.\n\n\"Seventh city next!\" Peak Sword crowed. \"Seven's lucky in Korea! As chairman of the South Korea Patriotic Society, I guarantee two elixirs minimum! Hahaha!\"\n\n\"Hell yeah! Let's move!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Don't celebrate too early.* The words stuck in Grid's throat. Why dampen the mood over baseless paranoia?\n\n*I never had friends to disappoint. No point starting now.*\n\nHe'd shoulder the worry alone.\n\nGrid shook himself and followed his companions deeper into the desert.\n\n***\n\nTwo months until the National Competition. Global attention reached fever pitch as analysts dissected potential outcomes.\n\n\"With the new ruleset, America's dominance seems inevitable. They'll sweep the gold medals—no question.\"\n\n\"Their player base alone guarantees it. Even with Zibal's absence, won't Kraugel fill that void?\"\n\n\"That's the headline story this year. Kraugel's nationality change—Russia to America.\"\n\n\"Russian interviews suggest he endured severe racial discrimination. Moving makes sense. But America instead of Korea? Given his heritage, shouldn't he have chosen his motherland?\"\n\n\"Speculation runs rampant. The prevailing theory...\"\n\nKraugel sought a rematch with Grid. By deliberately avoiding South Korea, he engineered their confrontation.\n\nMany believed it. Few found it credible, given Kraugel himself had never commented.\n\n—Rumors say it's about his mother's illness. America promised treatment. Makes sense.\n\n—More realistic than him avoiding Grid out of some rivalry complex. He already won last year. Why worry about Grid?\n\n—Exactly. Kraugel doesn't think about Grid that way.\n\nYet their duel from the previous competition remained immortal—consistently ranked in the top three moments of all National Competitions. Regardless of nationality, millions had replayed that clash. Again and again.\n\nThe public craved a rematch. The S.A. Group recognized this hunger—enough to feature last year's confrontation prominently in this year's opening video.\n\nBut realists knew better. This year's competition wouldn't see that showdown.\n\nLast year, Kraugel—despite being merely a normal class user—had bested Grid's legendary class.\n\nThis year? Kraugel had transcended. A legend. Specifically, the Sword Saint—mightiest of all legendary martial classes. He'd grown exponentially. Grid would crumble before him. Any rematch would be a massacre.\n\n—Grid's not weak. Few can match him.\n\n—Obviously.\n\n—But.\n\n—Kraugel's on another level.\n\n—Sky above the sky!\n\n—Kraugel's special even among special people. The absolute peak.\n\n—Makes no sense he'd avoid Korea because of someone he already defeated.\n\n—This year's narrative isn't Grid versus Kraugel. It's who claims second place in the medal count.\n\n—Agreed. America's locked for first.\n\nBehind America, Canada and China emerged as Satisfy superpowers through sheer population advantage. Which would claim silver? The debate raged. South Korea barely merited mention. Grid's name appeared in discussions only as an afterthought.\n\nOne person took notice.\n\n\"...South Korea won't be dismissed so easily.\"\n\nDungeon Maker Dark—formerly known as Eat Spicy Jokbal—stared at his screen. Recent drinking sessions with Peak Sword had shifted something fundamental within him. He opened his contacts and messaged the three friends who'd founded Blood Carnival alongside him.\n\n***\n\n[You have entered the 7th vampire city.]\n\n\"Same layout everywhere.\"\n\nOne constant united all vampire cities: absolute darkness. No light source existed. Within ten minutes of entry, visibility dropped to zero. A calculated vulnerability window.\n\n*Kkiiiiiiii!*\n\n*Kwaaaaah!*\n\nBefore their eyes could adjust, the city's wild guardians struck. Vampire familiars. Most first-time visitors died in this initial assault.\n\nBut Overgeared's veterans knew the pattern. Despite the blindness, they predicted attack vectors and countered accordingly. The entrance ambush posed no real threat.\n\nNormally.\n\n\"Kuk...!\"\n\n\"Why are they so strong?\"\n\n\"Shit! Stay alert!\"\n\nFamiliars poured from the darkness—from every angle, every shadow. Far stronger than previous encounters. Levels exceeding fifty. Numbers beyond estimation. Something had changed.\n\n*Kwang!*\n\n*Kwarururung!*\n\n\"Formation! Now!\"\n\n\"Stay tight until your eyes adjust! Watch your fire!\"\n\nCrisis. The Overgeared members found themselves driven back.\n\n\"Finally!\" Toban's voice rang with glee. \"Our turn!\"\n\nHe and Vantner—who'd contributed nothing in the previous two cities—stepped forward.\n\n\"**Sun Guard!**\"\n\nLight erupted from their shields. Brilliant, divine radiance that seared familiars adapted to centuries of darkness.\n\n*Yelp! Yipppp!*\n\n*Grrrrr!*\n\nWolf and bat familiars recoiled, blinded by the twin shields and Vantner's gleaming bald head. The Overgeared members seized the opening. The tide turned.\n\nThen voices descended from above.\n\n\"Hmm... they struggled against mere familiars. These can't be Elfin Stone's killers.\"\n\n\"Disappointing. Let's finish this quickly.\"\n\n\"....!!\"\n\nThe party froze. Four names materialized, blazing gold against the darkness.\n\n[**Earl Cray**]\n[**Earl Yetima**]  \n[**Earl Ruson**]  \n[**Earl Noll**]\n\nFour direct descendants. Each matching Elfin Stone's power. All staring down at them with predatory interest.\n\n\"Fuck...\"\n\n*Why is it always me?* Grid could only curse his fate."
