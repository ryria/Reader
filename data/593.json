  "content": "# Chapter: The Saintess's Burden\n\nWhile Grid devoted himself to mastering the Magic Battle Gear Production Method, the Overgeared members scattered across their territories, each shouldering their own burdens. They moved through Reinhardt, Patrian, and Bairan—encouraging those broken by war, mending what had been shattered, rebuilding what had fallen.\n\nYet the one who proved most invaluable in this recovery wasn't Jishuka, despite her battlefield prowess. Not Yura, for all her legendary power. Not even Regas or Pon, high rankers both. The heart of the relief effort beat in an unexpected chest—that of Grid's younger sister, Sehee.\n\nRuby's healing light swept through makeshift hospitals and cramped infirmaries. Her benevolent spirit touched not just wounded flesh, but broken minds. Wherever she walked, hope followed like a warm shadow.\n\n\"Thank you!\" A soldier clasped her hands, tears streaming down his weathered face. \"My friends... my family... they're alive because of you, Saintess!\"\n\nAn elderly woman leaned on a cane that days ago she couldn't have held. \"I thought I'd be bedridden forever. You've given me my life back. I'll spend every day I have left grateful for what you've done.\"\n\n\"Wait—the Saintess is Grid's sister?\" A merchant's eyes widened. \"How could one family produce two such remarkable people?\"\n\nWith each act of mercy, with each miracle worked by her hands, Ruby's influence grew. The people didn't just respect her—they loved her with a fierce, protective devotion. Her sphere of influence expanded until it rivaled even Grid's own.\n\nAnd Lauel, ever the strategist, recognized opportunity when it presented itself.\n\n---\n\n\"We need to accelerate the recovery timeline.\" Lauel stood before a map of their territories, fingers tracing supply lines. \"The people and soldiers must increase their work output. If Ruby addresses them about the necessity of labor, they'll respond.\"\n\nRuby's eyes flashed with indignation. \"Aren't they already working themselves to exhaustion? They eat, they sleep a few hours, then work again. If we push harder, they'll collapse.\"\n\n\"And when they fall,\" Lauel said without looking up from his map, \"can't you simply heal them?\"\n\n*Perfect infinite power.* The calculation was ruthless but accurate. A Saintess with area-of-effect healing created an environment where conventional human limits became... negotiable. Lauel couldn't suppress a satisfied smile at the efficiency of it all. Ruby's value to Overgeared's reconstruction efforts was immeasurable.\n\nRuby's lip curled in disgust. \"You're a terrible person.\"\n\n\"Condemn me if you must.\" Lauel finally met her gaze, his expression serious. \"But I'm proud of my decisions. Everything I do serves Grid's growth—serves Overgeared's future. I won't apologize for that.\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" Ruby spun away, her hair whipping through the air. \"I have nothing more to say to you.\"\n\nShe stalked toward the door, preparing to do exactly what he'd asked—to request more brutal labor from people who already gave everything they had. She was a member of Overgeared, after all. Lauel's authority over operations was absolute.\n\nBut she paused at the threshold, glancing back with steel in her voice. \"I'll take care of them. I'll make sure not a single person suffers because of your ambition.\"\n\nAfter she left, Lauel remained motionless, staring at the empty doorway.\n\nA smile crept unbidden across his face. \"Unlike Grid, she has a certain... charm...\"\n\n*Thump.*\n\nSomething stirred in his chest—a sensation he'd carefully locked away years ago, buried beneath strategy and calculation and duty.\n\n*What is this?* His hand pressed against his sternum. *This heat... spreading through my heart...*\n\nLauel didn't recognize it, couldn't name it.\n\nBut it was love.\n\nThe late-blooming first love of twenty-two-year-old Lauel had begun.\n\n---\n\n\"What?\" Toban's voice carried across the war room. \"Lauel ordered the main force to Reidan?\"\n\n\"That's correct.\" The messenger nodded. \"He says it borders the Saharan Empire and requires our strongest defensive posture.\"\n\n\"That makes no strategic sense!\" Toban had served as chief of staff for the Tzedakah Guild—he knew military logistics. \"We should be watching for Eternal's remnants, not the Empire. We killed their king and carved up their kingdom. They'll want revenge. If they mass forces and strike at Bairan or Reinhardt while we're looking south—\"\n\nEuphemina and Vantner exchanged uncertain glances.\n\n\"He's right,\" Euphemina said quietly. \"In our current position, Eternal's loyalists won't miss this vulnerability.\"\n\nVantner scratched his bald head. \"Did Lauel miscalculate? Maybe he's exhausted...\"\n\nDoubt crept through the room like fog.\n\nThen Yura spoke, her voice cutting through the murmurs. \"Lauel hasn't overlooked anything.\"\n\nAll eyes turned to her. Those peach-colored lips, framed by her elegant features, held their attention as much as her words.\n\n\"After King Aslan's death, his crimes became public knowledge. Marquis Steim has nothing holding him back anymore. He'll serve Youngwoo unconditionally now.\" Her gaze swept the room. \"But consider his position—he refused support during our greatest crisis. How can he approach Youngwoo empty-handed after such a betrayal?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Understanding dawned on Toban's face.\n\n\"Steim still commands the North!\" Euphemina's eyes lit up.\n\nVantner looked between them, confused. \"So...?\"\n\n\"Marquis Steim will come bearing gifts,\" Yura explained patiently. \"And those gifts will be the heads of every noble who opposed Grid. That's why Lauel positioned our forces in Reidan—he's preparing to receive Steim's allegiance and integrate the North's military strength.\"\n\n\"Incredible,\" Toban breathed. \"Lauel saw several moves ahead.\"\n\n\"Yura's no less impressive for recognizing his strategy,\" Euphemina added. \"Lauel could use someone with your analytical mind assisting him directly.\"\n\n\"No.\" Yura's response was immediate and firm. \"I need to level up. I'm supposed to be one of our guild's strongest assets.\"\n\nSilence followed.\n\n*Strongest asset?* Yura's hands clenched beneath the table where no one could see. *Can I really claim that?*\n\nEuphemina had an Epic Class. Jishuka wielded the myth-rated Red Phoenix Bow. Both of them fought on par with legends like Grid and Kraugel.\n\n*And me?* Yura's jaw tightened. *I have a Legendary Class... and I'm weak.*\n\nPride and shame warred in her chest. She'd dreamed of standing at the peak, of being stronger than everyone else.\n\n*My next destination...* Her eyes grew distant. *Hell.*\n\nThe one place where a Demon Slayer's abilities reached their zenith. Once the Overgeared Kingdom stabilized, once her duties here were complete, she would descend into the underworld itself. There, she would grow strong enough that no one—not even herself—could question her worth.\n\nYura's resolve hardened like tempered steel.\n\n---\n\nThree temples would rise in Reinhardt.\n\nPope Damian's command carried the weight of the entire Rebecca Church, and the elders—still reeling from Belial's defeat at Overgeared's hands—could only acquiesce. Full institutional support would flow to Grid and his guild. The faithful received their marching orders.\n\n> **[The 'Temple Construction' quest has been created.]**\n>\n> **Temple Construction**  \n> Difficulty: A  \n> The Rebecca Church plans to construct three temples in Reinhardt, territory of the great hero Grid. Lend your strength to this holy endeavor.\n>\n> Quest Clear Conditions: Work at least four days at the Rebecca Temple construction sites.  \n> Quest Reward: Assignment rights to the newly built temples. **Divine Power +20**. Additional compensation based on construction contribution.\n\n\"They're making paladins work construction?\" A young priest stared at the notification in disbelief. \"How desperate are they for labor?\"\n\n\"Traditionally, the lord whose territory receives a temple covers all construction costs,\" an older templar muttered. \"Are we really funding temples built in Grid's city?\"\n\n\"This is Pope Damian abusing his authority.\" A paladin's voice dripped with resentment. \"Everyone knows he's obsessed with Grid.\"\n\n\"I can't believe the elders approved it...\"\n\nDiscontent rippled through the Rebecca Church's player base. Being conscripted for construction work felt like exploitation, like being used for Damian's personal agenda.\n\nYet refusals were rare.\n\n*An A-grade quest...* Players examined the notification from different angles. *Those don't grow on trees.*\n\n*Twenty divine power is nothing to sneeze at.*\n\n*Reinhardt will be the Overgeared Kingdom's capital. Getting stationed there means access to high-level quest chains.*\n\n*Building goodwill with Overgeared could pay dividends later.*\n\n*Better to ride this wave than drown fighting the current.*\n\nTalent began flowing toward Reinhardt like rivers to the sea.\n\nThis was Overgeared's gravity—the power to reshape the landscape itself.\n\n---\n\n\"I'm sorry!\"\n\nPeak Sword couldn't meet anyone's eyes. The Silver Knights stood behind him, heads bowed under the weight of collective shame.\n\nCork Island was gone. Not damaged. Not occupied. *Destroyed.*\n\nThe thriving hub that once filled Overgeared's coffers with gold existed now only in memory. Tears carved tracks down Peak Sword's weathered face as images of the ruined island flashed through his mind.\n\n\"If we'd surrendered it to Eternal when you first suggested...\" His voice cracked. \"It wouldn't have been annihilated. We could have reclaimed it later. Instead, we fought for it and brought about something... irreversible.\"\n\nLauel placed a hand on Peak Sword's shoulder. \"This isn't your fault. It's mine. I should have anticipated Blood Carnival's interference.\"\n\nThere was no way he could have predicted it—but Lauel offered no excuses. In truth, he'd never expected Peak Sword to completely hold Cork Island against Eternal's navy. Blood Carnival's involvement had been the variable that transformed defensive success into catastrophic loss.\n\n*Now that it's destroyed, restoration costs exceed the island's value.* Lauel's mind worked through the calculations even as he consoled his guild member. *Better to write it off cleanly.*\n\nCork Island had been a major income source, yes. But the territories they'd seized from Eternal dwarfed its value a hundredfold. The loss stung, but it wasn't crippling.\n\nA messenger approached. \"Sir, Katz has returned.\"\n\nLauel straightened. The Blood Warrior—a man whose battlefield strength rivaled or possibly exceeded Grid's own. Lauel had entrusted him with an impossible task: hold Borneo for ten days against the Gauss Kingdom's military might.\n\nHe hurried to meet him. \"Welcome back. Your defense of our rear flank was invaluable.\"\n\nMaking Borneo a permanent holding would be ideal, but with only a thousand troops against Gauss's tens of thousands, even ten days would be a miracle—\n\n\"The Gauss Kingdom's army abandoned their invasion of Borneo,\" Katz reported calmly. \"They've withdrawn completely. I recommend sending reinforcements to ensure they don't reconsider.\"\n\nLauel's mouth opened. Closed. Opened again. \"...What?\"\n\n\"They gave up on Borneo and retreated.\"\n\nThe words made no sense. \"How did you... what did you...\"\n\nKatz made a circle with his thumb and forefinger. \n\n\"Money.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*I need to talk to Grid about proper funding,* Lauel thought distantly. *And get these two some legendary weapons for their achievements.*\n\n---\n\n*Clang! Clang! Clang!*\n\nDays blurred together. Grid slept only when exhaustion dragged him under, spending every conscious moment channeling Magic Missile.\n\n*Clang! Clang! Clang!*\n\nMetal rang against magical force. Again and again. His dark circles had deepened to bruises, his pallor deathly.\n\n\"Grid...\"\n\nIsabel watched from the smithy's doorway, her beautiful features twisted with worry. He was suffering for her sake. Pushing himself to the breaking point to forge her happiness.\n\n*How can I let him destroy himself for me?* Her hands clenched into fists. *I can't... I can't allow this anymore.*\n\nShe stepped forward, resolution hardening her spine. Her own circumstances didn't matter—only Grid's wellbeing.\n\n\"Grid!\" Her voice cut through the rhythmic clanging. \"Stop this! I won't—\"\n\nThe adamantium erupted with light.\n\nTen thousand impacts. The magic-forged metal blazed like a newborn star, illuminating every corner of the smithy with brilliant radiance.\n\nGrid turned to her, his exhausted face splitting into a smile that could have lit the world.\n\n\"Are you ready,\" he asked, \"to embrace your happiness?\""
