  "content": "> [Nefelina is assessing your current state.]\n\n> [Nefelina has determined your stats are lacking.]\n\nGrid's pulse quickened. *A dragon's blessing. What will it be?*\n\nHe watched Nefelina study him with those ancient, intelligent eyes. Dragons in Satisfy were legendary beings—their gifts carried immeasurable weight. Surely she would shore up his weaknesses.\n\n*Agility would be perfect. Or maybe intelligence...*\n\nBy ordinary standards, Grid's stats were already monstrous. Among the two billion players worldwide, perhaps a handful could match his raw numbers. But human nature was relentless—he couldn't help fixating on his weaker attributes. If anyone could push him beyond his limits, it would be a dragon.\n\nThen the notification appeared.\n\n> [Nefelina has blessed you with the power to overcome your deficiencies!]\n\n> [You will gain 10% additional experience when hunting monsters!]\n\n> [You will gain 20% additional experience when hunting boss monsters!]\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid stared at the messages. His soaring expectations crashed back to earth.\n\nExperience gain? That was the great dragon's blessing?\n\n\"This is what you—\"\n\n\"Are you calling my gift a curse?\" Nefelina's eyes narrowed dangerously.\n\n\"No, I just...\" Grid caught himself. The blessing was already integrated into his status window—undeniably real. Perhaps he'd simply built it up too much in his head. He'd imagined something dramatic like the Goddess' blessing, which had evolved an entire skill tree. An experience modifier felt... mundane by comparison.\n\n*Well, at least it'll help me level faster. Once the duration runs out— Wait.*\n\nGrid's eyes snapped back to the status window. His heart lurched.\n\n> [Dragon's Blessing]\n\n> [★ Growth Blessing ★\n\n> Additional 10% experience from monster hunts.\n\n> Additional 20% experience from boss monster hunts.]\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThere was no duration listed. No countdown timer. No expiration date.\n\n*Is this... permanent?*\n\nThe implications hit him like a lightning strike. Experience buffs were notoriously rare in Satisfy. Most players only encountered them during special events like the National Competition. Grid himself had access through the Reputation Store's lottery system—potions that granted 20% increased experience for three days at a time.\n\nThree days.\n\nNefelina's blessing had no such limitation. This was *forever*. Every hunt, every quest, every monster—he would always gain more experience than anyone else.\n\n*And 20% on bosses!*\n\nIf he stacked an experience potion on top of this... the combined effect would rival the National Competition's first-place reward buff.\n\nGrid swallowed hard, his throat suddenly dry. \"I... I finally understand.\"\n\nNefelina's tail swished with satisfaction. \"You've finally grasped the magnitude of my gift.\"\n\nThe truth crystallized in his mind. Named NPCs—the dukes, the Red Knights, legendary figures like Grandmaster Zikfrector—they all possessed an inherent advantage. The system applied an average level correction that kept them scaling with player progression. They leveled naturally, steadily, always remaining just out of reach.\n\nUntil now.\n\nFor the first time, Grid saw a path to close that gap. To match their growth. To surpass them.\n\n\"Thank you!\" The words burst out of him. Without thinking, he swept Nefelina into a tight embrace. In her current miniature form, she was impossibly adorable—he couldn't help himself.\n\n\"Hiccup—!\" Nefelina's wings shot out in surprise. \"Y-You dare! This majestic form is not for—\"\n\n\"Sorry! You're just so cute that I couldn't—\"\n\n\"*Cute?!* I am an existence you should revere!\" \n\nHer wings flapped frantically as she lifted off, breaking free from his grasp. The sudden surge of magic power tore through the space reconstruction spell maintaining the area. Reality itself began to warp and distort around them.\n\n\"*Kyaaah!*\" Chef Idan collapsed in terror.\n\nThe Evil Eyes' King dropped to his knees immediately. \"Destroyer of the Future! Please, we beg you to restrain your power!\"\n\nBut Nefelina heard nothing over her own indignation. She hovered at eye level with Grid, smoke curling from her nostrils. \"You only got away with such familiarity when I was in the egg! Things are different now that I've hatched! I'm not a baby anymore—remember that!\"\n\n\"Yes, absolutely. I understand.\"\n\n*She remembers being in the egg?* Grid filed that revelation away. It explained why she'd been so receptive to him from the start. Still, lesson learned—no more spontaneous hugging.\n\n***\n\n\"So I'm planning to focus on hunting for a while.\"\n\nFreshly blessed by a dragon, Grid had one person in mind to consult. Not Lauel. Not his guild members. He needed Panmir.\n\n\"What's the safest area in the volcanic zones surrounding Talima?\"\n\nPanmir's expression shifted immediately. \"You want to hunt *there?*\"\n\n\"That's the plan.\"\n\nEveryone knew about Talima's volcanic ring. It was home to the lair of Fire Dragon Trauka—one of the setting's oldest and most dangerous entities. Even the legendary Braham Eshwald's greatest boast was merely that he'd *survived* an encounter with Trauka. That should tell anyone everything they needed to know.\n\n\"If you run into Trauka—\"\n\n\"I'll die. Obviously. That's why I need to know which areas are relatively safe.\"\n\nPanmir held the distinction of being the first-ranked blacksmith for good reason. In some ways, his knowledge exceeded even Grid's—particularly regarding dwarven smithing. Grid knew Panmir had successfully reached Talima before. If anyone had mapped the safer hunting grounds, it would be him.\n\nBut Panmir's brow furrowed, his silence stretching uncomfortably long.\n\n\"Oh.\" Grid caught himself. \"Sorry, I shouldn't have asked. Forget it.\"\n\nInformation was currency in Satisfy—often worth more than rare items. They might be allies, but Grid couldn't expect Panmir to simply hand over hard-earned intelligence. Hell, the fact that Kraugel had shared details about the Behen Archipelago and Ether Diamonds without asking for anything in return was exceptional even among guildmates.\n\n\"No, that's not it.\" Panmir shook his head. \"I'm not uncomfortable sharing. The problem is I genuinely don't know.\"\n\n\"You don't?\"\n\n\"I reached the dwarves through... let's call it outside assistance. I never explored the volcanic zones myself.\"\n\n\"Outside assistance?\"\n\n\"The Rothschild Guild.\"\n\n\"As in *the* Rothschilds?\"\n\n\"One and the same. They wield the same influence in Satisfy that they do in the real world. Must have recognized the game's potential from day one and invested accordingly.\" Panmir shrugged. \"Point is, they're the only ones with detailed information about Talima's surrounding territories. I can't help you with safe zones.\"\n\nGrid's curiosity shifted. \"They have that much power? How have I never heard of them?\"\n\n\"They prefer working through proxies—building up smaller forces, backing existing powers from the shadows. An agent approached me initially, not anyone from the family directly.\"\n\n\"Why the secrecy?\"\n\n\"That's just their style. Probably easier than dealing with everyone personally.\"\n\n\"And they connected you with the dwarves?\"\n\n\"Right. At first, the Rothschilds tried establishing a direct relationship with dwarf craftsmen. When that proved... complicated, they decided it would be more efficient to sponsor a player who could learn dwarven techniques. Someone controllable.\"\n\n\"How'd that work out?\"\n\n\"Well.\" Panmir's smile turned rueful. \"As you can see, I ended up in the Overgeared Kingdom as a free agent. Not exactly what they had in mind.\"\n\n\"They just *cut loose* a blacksmith of your caliber?\"\n\n\"Haha...\" Panmir scratched his head. \"Yeah. I'm first on the rankings. Unless there's some monster hiding among the unofficial rankers, I'm the second-best blacksmith player in the game after you. The fact they could discard me so easily tells you how absurdly skilled the dwarf craftsmen must be.\"\n\nGrid frowned. \"Should we consider them a threat?\"\n\n\"Doubtful. Their goal is accumulating wealth quietly. No reason for conflict—they'd probably prefer a mutually beneficial relationship with the Overgeared Kingdom.\"\n\n\"True. Lauel would've warned me by now if they were dangerous.\"\n\nReassured, Grid opened his status window and accessed the Reputation Store. He burned through his points at the lottery system, securing five experience potions. If he was going to do this, he'd do it right. At least a month of solid hunting.\n\n*The Galgunos Temple it is.*\n\nThe volcanic zones were ideal, but the risk of encountering Trauka was too high. The dragon's blessing meant he could afford one or two deaths without falling behind. But three or more? That was pushing it. In the worst case, he might lose equipment.\n\nNot worth it. Better to play it safe.\n\n***\n\n> [(Breaking News) Grid's Leveling Speed Accelerates Dramatically]\n\nTwenty days had passed since Grid departed for the hunting grounds. \n\nThe Overgeared Palace stood mostly empty—nearly all core members were off grinding their own levels. Yet despite the quiet, tension thrummed beneath the surface. Three months remained until the truce with the Saharan Empire expired.\n\nThe Overgeared Kingdom's progressive stance toward different species—accepting demonkin, integrating the evil eyes, forging alliances with non-human races—ran directly counter to the Empire's supremacist ideology. This wasn't peace. It was the calm before the storm.\n\nThe training yard, at least, never stopped. Soldiers drilled day and night under the watchful eyes of Piaro, Mercedes, and Singuled. Lauel often watched from a distance, finding a sliver of peace in their dedication.\n\nToday, that peace shattered.\n\n\"What?\" Lauel's eyes widened as Faker approached with his report.\n\n\"Agnus. He's here in Reinhardt.\"\n\n\"Agnus came *here?*\" Lauel's mind raced. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Apparently to visit Elizabeth.\"\n\nThe most wanted player across seven kingdoms. Accused of murdering multiple accessory makers—though Lauel knew better than to trust those charges at face value.\n\n\"Should I remove him?\" Faker's tone was neutral, but the implicit offer was clear.\n\n\"No...\" Lauel tapped his chin thoughtfully. \"Let's observe for now.\"\n\nAgnus had a reputation as a madman, a purely malevolent force. But his actions during recent crises told a different story. He'd protected Queen Irene and Prince Lord when it mattered.\n\n*His power in large-scale battles might exceed even Grid's. If we could bring him into the fold...*\n\n\"Keep tabs on him, but don't interfere.\" Lauel turned on his heel. \"I need to find Prince Lord.\"\n\n***\n\n\"What brings you to the training grounds?\" Coke intercepted Lauel near where Lord studied under Sticks' tutelage.\n\nLauel's smile was disarmingly casual. \"Thought I'd take the Prince for a walk.\"\n\n\"...A walk?\" Coke's instincts flared. \"Understood.\"\n\nThis was no ordinary stroll—not with both Lauel and Faker involved. Coke's hand drifted closer to his sword as he followed them out."
