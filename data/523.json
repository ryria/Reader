  "content": "\"Huh??\"\n\nGrid's eyes widened as he examined the hidden passive skill **God's Command**. His mind reeled from the shock.\n\n\"I-It's good, but...\"\n\nSo *this* was why **Linked Kill** and **Linked Kill Wave** had reset their cooldowns earlier.\n\n*Amazing!*\n\nThe value was extraordinary—comparable to obtaining **Pagma's Descendant** or the **Legendary Great Magician** classes.\n\n*I never thought Dominion's blessing would matter this much.*\n\nDuring the encounter with Pope Drevigo, he'd received blessings from Rebecca, Judar, and Dominion. All three had been applied to the **pavranium**, directly buffing him. Rebecca's Blessing increased health recovery by 300%, Dominion's Blessing boosted attack power by 15%, and Judar's Blessing enhanced defense by 15%. A pattern began to emerge in Grid's mind.\n\n*Dominion's Blessing is one of three major passive attack buffs... which means Judar's Blessing is one of three major passive defense buffs, and Rebecca's Blessing is one of three major recovery buffs?*\n\nHe grimaced.\n\n*The odds of collecting all three must be astronomical.*\n\nCalling the acquisition requirements for **God's Command** ridiculous would be an understatement. Possessing Dominion's blessing, achieving unique damage feats, *and* earning Zeratul's favor? How many of Satisfy's two billion users could meet those conditions? The thought of similar passive skills tied to Judar's and Rebecca's blessings made his head spin.\n\n*It's the same with domain and ruling ability.*\n\nGrid's countless unlucky experiences told him that domain and ruling ability would prove far more fraudulent than **God's Command**.\n\n*Eventually, my enemies will acquire domain and ruling ability. Hell, some probably already have it.*\n\nThat was how this damn world worked. It never made things easy for him.\n\n*Will I end up dying to domain and ruling ability later?*\n\nHe shook his head sharply. He wouldn't let that happen.\n\n*From now on, I'm invincible.*\n\nWhy? Because he possessed the **good luck** stat!\n\n\"Kuhuhuhut! I'll show you the combination of **God's Command** and **good luck**!\"\n\n**God's Command** carried a 50% chance of resetting cooldowns. What if his **good luck** stat influenced that probability?\n\n*There'll be a higher than 50% chance of resetting cooldowns!*\n\nExactly like moments ago when the skill had triggered repeatedly. Grid channeled his faith in the **good luck** stat and aimed at the wrecked tent before him. Drawing a deep breath, he unleashed **Pagma's Swordsmanship, Wave**, intending to confirm **God's Command**'s effect.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nGrid blinked in confusion, then steadied himself.\n\n\"Hu... Hut! Well, it's not 100%. It can fail occasionally.\"\n\nPerhaps his **good luck** stat was having an off day. He forced his racing heart to calm, then fired **Pagma's Swordsmanship, Link**.\n\nThe result?\n\n**God's Command** didn't activate. The cooldown remained unchanged.\n\nThe same thing happened when he used **Kill** and **Pinnacle**.\n\n\"Pant pant. This is absolutely rotten.\"\n\nA creeping sense of instability settled over him. Thinking back, the **5 Joint Attacks** skill attached to the **Holy Light Gloves** and **Failure** had barely triggered over the past few months. The cruel truth crashed down on him: his bad luck was so astronomically high that it completely overshadowed his meager **good luck** stat.\n\n\"No... Why? Why do I keep getting skills like this?\"\n\nLess fraudulent skills—that's what he needed. Skills that delivered consistent results instead of gambling on probabilities.\n\n*Flop!*\n\nGrid's elation collapsed into bitter frustration. No matter how he looked at it, relying on **God's Command** felt like building a house on sand.\n\n\"I don't need to count on this skill.\"\n\nFighting with the assumption that **God's Command** would activate was a recipe for disappointment. Better to fight normally and simply thank the gods *if* it triggered.\n\n\"Yes... **God's Command** isn't the only reward I got. No need to obsess over it.\"\n\nThere was still the **Pangea's New Star** title.\n\n*Please let it increase good luck.*\n\nThe desperation gnawed at him. His luck seemed destined to remain cursed forever. He desperately needed the **good luck** stat. Grid pulled up the title information.\n\n> **[Pangea's New Star 1st Stage]**\n> \n> Stage 1: It is relatively easy to obtain information from the residents of Pangea.\n> \n> * Every time you destroy a monster community formed in the north, the level and effectiveness of the title will increase.\n\n\"...\"\n\nDisappointment crashed over him. After the letdown of **God's Command**'s unreliability, this felt even more underwhelming.\n\n\"Hah...\"\n\nGrid sighed heavily and turned his attention to the remaining items, checking them one by one.\n\n> **[Blessed Weapon Enhancement Scroll]**\n> \n> A scroll used to enhance weapons.\n> \n> Successful enhancement of a weapon will increase the enhancement value by +1.\n> \n> If the enhancement fails, the weapon's strength won't fall.\n\n> **[Blessed Armor Enhancement Scroll]**\n> \n> A scroll used to enhance armor.\n> \n> Successful enhancement of armor will increase the enhancement value by +1.\n> \n> If the enhancement fails, the armor's strength won't fall.\n\n\"...?\"\n\nUntil now, Grid had assumed **blessed enhancement scrolls** were simply the East Continent's version of enhancement stones—the same effect under a different name and appearance. But he'd been completely wrong. The blessed scrolls weren't quite as powerful for enhancement, but they offered something far more valuable: *stability*.\n\n*Holy shit, wouldn't the rich players pay fortunes for these?*\n\nItem enhancement success rates existed in the decimal percentages. Someone could attempt enhancement a hundred times and fail every single one. But the real burden wasn't just the monetary loss—it was watching the enhancement value *drop* with each failure. That was the killer.\n\nThese scrolls protected against that degradation entirely.\n\n*The chaebols would throw billions of won at blessed enhancement scrolls to reach +10.*\n\nHis mind raced.\n\n*They can't afford to miss this opportunity.*\n\nWouldn't each scroll sell for at least ten million won?\n\n*What am I thinking—ten million? These could go for billions.*\n\nThe scrolls resembled talismans, with characters similar to Chinese script written across the center. They could only be obtained on the East Continent.\n\n*Items that haven't hit the market yet. The value will be absurd.*\n\nNo need to rush into selling them. Since becoming a **lord**, Grid had achieved financial stability. He could monitor the auction house trends and sell at his preferred price—or keep them for personal use. He moved on to the next item, dropped by the **Strong Male Rat**.\n\n> **[Strong Male Rat's Gallbladder]**\n> \n> A very large and bitter gallbladder.\n> \n> Consuming too much may cause shock.\n> \n> However, if endured, resistance to poisoning and confusion will permanently increase by 0.5%.\n> \n> Weight: 4\n\n> **[Strong Male Rat's Heart]**\n> \n> A heart filled with the natural strength of the Strong Male Rat.\n> \n> The source of the Strong Male Rat's power.\n> \n> Once consumed, **strength** will permanently increase by 5.\n> \n> Weight: 2\n\n\"Mini elixirs!\"\n\nDespite slaughtering countless vampires, he'd never obtained proper elixirs. These offered half the effect of normal elixirs, but he'd gladly consume them for permanent stat increases. Grid devoured the heart without hesitation and stowed the gallbladder in his inventory. The phrase \"possibility of shock\" was concerning, but he could sell it to an **Overgeared** member.\n\n*Items from intermediate bosses are excellent. The Queen Rat's drops should be even better.*\n\nLululala~\n\nGrid hummed cheerfully as anticipation built. He examined the **Queen Rat's** loot without delay.\n\n> **[Queen Rat's Walnut]**\n> \n> A walnut that the Queen Rat stored for a quick meal.\n> \n> Weight: 1\n\n\"...?\"\n\nDisbelief froze him in place. After a moment's stunned silence, Grid activated **Legendary Blacksmith's Appraisal**.\n\n*Ttiring~*\n\n> **[A hidden function doesn't exist.]**\n\n\"Shit.\"\n\nA saliva-soaked walnut. The stench reminded him of hamster drool. Grid hurled it away in disgust. That a boss monster had dropped literal garbage defied comprehension. Anger simmering, Grid appraised the next item.\n\n> **[Queen Rat's Fur]**\n> \n> The Queen Rat's fur is called the finest fur and holds tremendous value.\n> \n> But the Queen Rat is a fierce and powerful monster.\n> \n> Obtaining the Queen Rat's fur is like plucking a star from the sky.\n> \n> Weight: 120\n> \n> **[This item has a hidden function.]**\n> \n> **[Rumor has it the lord is searching for Queen Rat fur!]**\n\n\"...This is better.\"\n\nObviously, it would fetch a high price as premium leather material. But Grid wanted to use it himself rather than sell it.\n\n*I'll make legendary leather armor.*\n\nThe quest didn't interest him. Wasting precious material on some random quest seemed foolish.\n\n*Sure, quests requiring rare items usually offer enormous rewards.*\n\nBut there was always the chance those rewards wouldn't benefit him personally. Better to use the material directly. Between **God's Command**'s disappointing activation rate and the worthless walnut, Grid felt thoroughly betrayed by probability. Finally, he examined **Idan's Frying Pan** with genuine amazement.\n\n\"This is real?\"\n\nIdan—the chef who couldn't cook. Honestly, Grid hadn't considered this quest particularly important. He'd coveted the 30% experience reward, but hunting monsters seemed faster for leveling than wasting time searching for a frying pan. The East Continent's monsters provided massive experience gains anyway.\n\nBut now his perspective had shifted. Grid recognized the tremendous significance of Idan's quest.\n\n*The experience is just a side benefit.*\n\nHe needed to build **affinity** with Idan. Understanding dawning, Grid rushed back toward Pangea."
