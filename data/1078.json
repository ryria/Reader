  "content": "In Satisfy, every major event had its witnesses—not the system operators, but the players themselves. Over two billion of them, scattered across the vast continent, experiencing its unfolding stories firsthand. They were the eyes and ears of this world.\n\nToday was no different.\n\nThe imperial palace stood as one of the grandest structures on the West Continent, its halls bustling with thousands of workers. Among them moved players—some with skills sharp enough to slip past even the royal guards undetected. When whispers of upheaval within the palace began to spread, these operatives naturally gravitated toward the audience hall, curiosity overriding caution.\n\nThen they saw him.\n\nPrince Edan emerged from the shadows, his clothes soaked crimson. The traitor himself, architect of the current chaos, cutting down royal guards as he stalked through the palace corridors. He pushed open the doors to the audience hall, leaving a trail of corpses in his wake.\n\nChaos erupted among the hidden observers. Despite knowing the odds of discovery—and subsequent execution—hovered near certainty, they couldn't resist. This was the story of a lifetime. These weren't mere workers; they were skilled professionals, rankers in their respective fields. They understood the value of information, and were willing to risk everything to hear what transpired within that hall.\n\n*'The imperial concubine killed the empress?'*\n\n*'Edan tried to eliminate the dukes who discovered the truth?'*\n\n*'Gods, this is straight out of a tragedy...'*\n\nThe intelligence alone was worth a fortune. Gossip networks would pay handsomely for such details. And warning the Empress's loyal knights—those still unaware of her fate—could forge valuable alliances. One player pretended to tend a potted plant. Another wiped at an already-clean window frame. They strained to catch every word filtering through the doors.\n\nThen came the footsteps.\n\n*Step. Step. Step.*\n\nSlow. Measured. Unhurried. The sound echoed through blood-stained corridors with unnatural clarity. Someone was approaching the audience hall as if they had all the time in the world. The players tensed. Every instinct screamed that whoever owned those footsteps was no ordinary individual.\n\nThey tried to hide more carefully.\n\nIt was useless.\n\nThe moment Grandmaster Zikfrector's presence washed over them, every concealment technique the rankers possessed simply... stopped working.\n\n[You cannot deceive the target's senses!]\n\n[The 'Stealth' skill has been turned off.]\n\n[The target has grasped your intentions!]\n\n[The 'Irrelevant Person' skill has been turned off.]\n\n[The target has noticed your magic power!]\n\n[The unique magic 'Chameleon' has been released.]\n\nSkills they'd spent years perfecting, abilities they'd taken immense pride in—all neutralized by mere proximity to this man.\n\n\"Uh... ah...\" The exposed players stumbled backward, hearts hammering. Before the grandmaster, they felt like ants on a roadside—insignificant, helpless. Yet he didn't even glance their way.\n\n*Step.*\n\nHe simply walked past them and entered the audience hall.\n\n\"What... did we just see?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThey'd survived. That realization hit them like a hammer. The players slumped against the walls, touching their chests as if to confirm their hearts still beat. But curiosity was a powerful thing, and soon they were leaning close to the doors again, desperate to hear how the grandmaster would intervene in this royal catastrophe.\n\n\"Run! Get out of here now!\"\n\nThe shout echoed from a distant hallway. Heads whipped around. The players recognized the man sprinting toward them—Zibal, one of the strongest users in Satisfy and a known subordinate of Prince Edan. Behind him ran dozens of knights in crimson armor.\n\n\"Red Knights!\"\n\nPanic. The players scrambled to flee, burning through skill cooldowns in their desperation to escape. But they were too slow. Single-digit knights—the elite among elites—cut off their retreat with practiced efficiency, binding them in place.\n\n\"Shit!\" Zibal cursed, drawing his blade. Shockingly, he moved to strike down the players himself.\n\nSteel met steel before his sword could land. One of the knights had intercepted him, despite having drawn her weapon a heartbeat later than Zibal. Her name was Susan—cousin to the legendary knight Mercedes, and a member of the Neo Red Knights, the emperor's new order trained personally by the grandmaster himself.\n\n\"They'll resurrect if you kill them,\" she said coldly. \"Better to imprison them. It'll be problematic if what they've witnessed spreads.\"\n\nSusan possessed beauty reminiscent of Mercedes, but her expression carried none of her cousin's warmth. When those transparent, ice-blue eyes fixed on Zibal, he felt the temperature drop. \"Sir Zibal. Did you know that, and deliberately tried to kill them anyway?\"\n\n*'What eyes...'*\n\nZibal swallowed hard. \"No way. I just... wasn't thinking clearly.\"\n\nHis gaze shifted to the captured players, now forced to kneel on the freezing marble floor. They might be imprisoned for days, weeks—falling behind the competition, losing hard-won levels and reputation. Some might never recover their status as rankers.\n\n*'Damn.'*\n\nWhen had he started worrying about others? Zibal clicked his tongue, anxiety gnawing at him.\n\n*'This is all going to hell.'*\n\nEdan had been declared a traitor. Everything was at risk. Zibal had multiple opportunities to abandon ship and save himself. Yet here he stood, facing disaster alongside the prince. Why?\n\nIt wasn't just about the promise that Raiders would eventually be transferred to him if he maximized his relationship with Edan.\n\nOver the past few years, Zibal had received countless favors from the prince. As a Blue Sky Rider who'd evolved into an Ancient Rider, Zibal held special significance for Edan. When Zibal had fled to aid the Haken Kingdom, Edan had simply said, \"Thank you for showing the world what magic machines can do.\"\n\nNo punishment. No recriminations. And the bonds Zibal had formed with the other members of the magic machine unit ran deep. To abandon them now, to run and save only himself...\n\nImpossible. The current Zibal couldn't do it. He'd lost everything once before, had known the bitter taste of isolation. He understood—desperately, viscerally—how precious companions were.\n\n*'Tsk. I hope this works out.'*\n\nThrough the partially open doors, Zibal watched Edan's back. The prince had the grandmaster's support, but that was precisely the problem. The grandmaster had just betrayed the emperor without hesitation. How could such a man be trusted?\n\n*'What does he really want from placing Edan on the throne?'*\n\nThis was purely transactional. Edan wanted to become emperor; the grandmaster had decided to help because he stood to gain something. But once the grandmaster obtained whatever he sought, there was no guarantee he'd remain on Edan's side.\n\n*'Damn it. And I'm stuck in the middle of this mess.'*\n\nDeep down, Zibal knew there was only one ending waiting for Edan. An unfortunate one. It was inevitable, really. Edan had lost himself long ago. Perhaps his ambitions had once been for his mother, but now... now he'd become someone who could insult her memory in public and raise his blade against his own father. His crimes had brought suffering to countless innocents. He was beyond redemption.\n\n*'No... maybe not. Maybe things can still work out.'*\n\nZibal prayed. He hoped Edan would achieve his goal. Perhaps then, the prince could finally begin to atone.\n\n*'Just don't forget what I've done for you. Give me that magic machine. Make me a duke, too.'*\n\n***\n\nWhile turmoil reigned beyond the doors...\n\n\"I will now install Fourth Prince Edan as the new emperor. The proof of qualification lies here—the sword of our founding emperor, Saharan.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nStunned silence filled the audience hall. The grandmaster's absurd declaration left everyone speechless. Duke Grenhal was the first to recover, his face flushing crimson. \"Zikfrector! The emperor alone decides his successor! By what right do you presume to place anyone on the throne?\"\n\n\"Your understanding is lacking.\" The grandmaster's tone suggested mild boredom, as if he might yawn at any moment. \"I presented the founding emperor's sword as proof of qualification. You should know this qualification is sufficient to establish a new emperor.\"\n\nDuke Morse stepped forward, anger rising. \"How can we believe that? I've never heard of the founding emperor's sword carrying such authority! How can you even prove this is Saharan's sword?\"\n\n\"You don't know, but one person does.\" The grandmaster's gaze settled on Emperor Juander. \"Have you not been told the meaning of Saharan's sword?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Your Majesty!\"\n\nThe emperor remained silent. The dukes' expressions shifted from anger to confusion. That silence was answer enough.\n\n\"'If my descendants fail to keep the promise, you may take away the throne at any time.'\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Those were Saharan's final words. They have been conveyed to every emperor since.\"\n\n\"Why... why would he say that?\"\n\nShock rippled through the assembled nobles. Even Bain stood speechless. Why had the founding emperor left such a command? What promise? How long had the grandmaster existed? Grandmaster Zikfrector showed no interest in their confusion. His attention remained fixed on the emperor.\n\n\"Juander, you have forgotten.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"You ignored my warnings repeatedly and turned away from the Abyss.\"\n\nFinally, the emperor spoke. \"I'm sorry.\" His voice was heavy with resignation. \"But you never explained. You never gave proper warnings. You simply recommended exploring the Abyss, then remained idle when I delayed. If you'd pressed the matter, if you'd made clear this was a warning... I didn't know the promise between you and my ancestor was tied to that place. So much has been lost over the centuries!\"\n\n\"You are indeed an ignorant dreamer.\" For the first time, the grandmaster's expression shifted. His gaze now held pity, as if he beheld something pathetic and broken. \"The moment you became emperor, you abandoned responsibility for the space entrusted to you.\"\n\n*Step.*\n\nThe grandmaster took one pace forward.\n\n\"You never even tried to discover what the promise entailed.\"\n\n*Step.*\n\nTwo paces.\n\n\"And rather than blame yourself for ignoring my counsel, you shift responsibility to others.\"\n\n*Step.*\n\nThree paces. Yet somehow, with only three steps, the grandmaster now stood directly before the emperor. Space itself seemed to fold. That was how Bain perceived it, at least.\n\n\"You are the most incompetent and selfish of all who have worn the crown. You blamed the loss of your beloved woman, but you were incompetent and dull from the very beginning. On the other hand...\" The grandmaster finished his ruthless assessment and turned to Edan. \"Your son possesses admirable qualities. After visiting the Abyss just once, he understood what I sought and proposed a deal. It was like witnessing Saharan's second coming. I even felt... joy.\"\n\nThe grandmaster tapped Saharan's sword with one finger. Instantly, a torrent of red energy erupted from the blade, flooding the audience hall in crimson light. The power was so immense that even Grid's group, just arriving at Titan's outskirts, could see it blazing in the distance."
