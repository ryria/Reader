Fifteen hundred competitors from fifty nations stand with steely resolve while the audience roars its approval. 』**\n\n**『 The stakes couldn't be higher. Winners walk away with wealth and glory, while their home nations receive powerful buffs. 』**\n\n**『 Which countries will dominate? Which dark horses will emerge? 』**\n\n**『 I'm betting on fresh talent. 』**\n\n**『 Difficult when the established rankers cast such long shadows. 』**\n\n**『 Never underestimate the world's depth. Hidden masters exist—Ares and Agnus proved that. 』**\n\nYear after year, the National Competition grew in scale and prestige. More countries. Larger crowds. And with that expansion came higher stakes—the kind that made even seasoned rankers sweat.\n\nGold medalists could claim a legendary-grade item or myth-grade materials. Silver winners secured unique-grade items or legendary materials. Bronze medalists earned epic-grade items or unique materials.\n\nOn the surface, bronze seemed like a consolation prize. But clever players recognized the loophole. The rules didn't explicitly exclude growth-type items. A bronze medal could net an epic-rated growth weapon—and most of those eventually evolved to legendary grade.\n\n*I'm taking home a medal. No matter what.*\n\nWhen Chris—currently ranked first on the unified leaderboards—took his place on the stage, the intensity in the Dome became palpable. Competitors shifted in their seats, jaws tight with determination.\n\nGrid, Kraugel, and Jishuka had already claimed gold-equivalent rewards from the recent Battlefield event. That the three strongest had grown even stronger cast a shadow over everyone else. The mountain had just gotten steeper.\n\n*Especially Grid's crafting. That's the real problem.*\n\nHigh-grade materials didn't guarantee high-grade results. RNG was RNG. But Grid was different. As a legendary blacksmith, conventional wisdom held that he could forge myth-rated items from legendary materials. If the Overgeared Kingdom swept the medals, their power would skyrocket.\n\nOf course, it was a misconception.\n\n*Should I just take a finished item?*\n\nOriginally, Grid wanted sacred creature by-products—materials on par with the Red Phoenix Breath. He dreamed of forging a second or third masterpiece comparable to the Red Phoenix Bow or Enlightenment Blade.\n\nBut myth-grade materials didn't guarantee myth-grade results. He'd used Great Demon Belial's remains to craft gear for Overgeared members—some turned legendary, others merely unique. He could fail.\n\n*On the other hand, a legendary growth-type item guarantees eventual myth-grade...*\n\nAfter the opening ceremony concluded, Grid remained on the field, lost in thought.\n\n\"Grid.\"\n\nHe turned to find Jishuka approaching, her crimson hair blazing gold in the sunlight. Beautiful didn't do her justice.\n\n\"I'll request the Red Phoenix Breath. I'm hoping you can create something that synergizes with the bow.\" Her smile was warm, trusting.\n\n\"I can't guarantee a myth-rated result, even with the Breath.\" Grid needed to be honest. \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"I believe in you.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nHis chest tightened. Not just from her radiance, but from the absolute faith behind those simple words. It gave him courage.\n\n\"Alright... I'll take the Blue Dragon Breath, then.\"\n\n\"Mm?\"\n\n\"Once I grab two more medals, I'll claim the White Tiger's Breath and Black Tortoise's Breath. I'll be cheering for you too, Jishuka.\"\n\n\"Yes... I'll always cheer for you. Thank you.\"\n\nHer smile intensified, luminous. Grid's presence was a source of strength. Had she ever relied on someone this completely? The thought made her happy. She wanted to stay by his side.\n\n\"...So we should get married.\"\n\n\"Huh? What? Can't hear you over the crowd.\"\n\n\"Ah, nothing. Just talking to myself.\"\n\nJishuka's face flushed crimson. Somehow, confessing in reality was harder than in Satisfy.\n\n\"Grid.\" Another beauty materialized, shattering their moment. Where Jishuka blazed like the sun, Yura was the moon—cold and luminous. \"The preliminary event selections are out.\"\n\nYura's icy gaze swept over Jishuka, lingering on her low-cut top with obvious distaste.\n\n\"Everyone's waiting in the team room. Let's go.\"\n\nShe seized Grid's wrist.\n\nJishuka's jaw clenched. Her smile remained fixed, but hostility flickered in her eyes.\n\n\"Ah, how nice to be teammates.\"\n\n\"Better than living on opposite sides of the world.\"\n\n\"Proximity doesn't equal closeness. My Korean immigration papers are already processing.\"\n\n\"Can someone with massive debt casually relocate? Or are you planning to overstay your visa?\"\n\n\"Ugh...! I'm winning gold this Competition and clearing that debt!\"\n\n\"We'll see. We might be competing in the same events.\"\n\n\"You'd sabotage me? Fine! Bring it! Let's see how tough you are after your little hell vacation!\"\n\n\"Can you even keep up?\"\n\n*Crackle!*\n\n*Pop-pop-pop!*\n\nWhen Jishuka's fiery stare collided with Yura's frigid glare, the air itself seemed to freeze and spark with electricity. Grid stood between them, utterly baffled.\n\n*What's their problem?*\n\nHe had no idea that every man within fifty feet was dying of envy.\n\n---\n\nThis year featured twenty-seven events. Countries weren't required to enter all of them—strategy meant picking battles where medals were achievable. The S.A. Group released preliminary event selections to encourage tactical maneuvering and create uncertainty.\n\nIt gave everyone headaches. Were competitors bluffing? Telling the truth? Teams held emergency meetings to parse the possibilities.\n\n\"Grid, which events are you entering?\"\n\nInside South Korea's waiting room, all eyes turned to their ace. Natural to defer to the competitor with the highest win probability.\n\n\"Um...\"\n\nGrid studied the U.S. team's selections, particularly Kraugel's choices.\n\n\"PvP makes sense, but... saint sword drawing?\"\n\nSaint sword drawing had been a staple event for three years, but remained relatively niche. Too complex, too slow-paced to draw mainstream interest.\n\n\"Isn't this a puzzle-heavy event?\"\n\nExactly. Competitors had to study the sword's lore, decipher hidden clues, and complete quests tailored to the weapon's requirements. Some quests involved combat, others pure problem-solving. It required extensive game knowledge—the opposite of Grid's strengths.\n\n\"Would Kraugel actually enter this?\"\n\nThese were *desired* events. Grid convinced himself Kraugel was bluffing.\n\n\"Why fake it, though? What's his real target?\"\n\nGrid wanted to face Kraugel in multiple events. Not just because of Damian's press conference—losing last year's PvP still stung. Kraugel had handed him a gold medal out of pity. This year, Grid wanted to *take* two golds from him. While Grid strategized, Yura and Peak Sword chimed in.\n\n\"Kraugel's brilliant. Few are better suited for saint sword drawing.\"\n\n\"His level's currently low, so full combat power's unavailable. Saint sword drawing lets him compensate with intelligence.\"\n\n\"...Kraugel's smart?\"\n\n\"Obviously. Remember his plays as rank one? Extraordinary tactics.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nSo he really was entering saint sword drawing. Grid tested the waters. \"What if I participated?\"\n\n\"...Please don't.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nRevenge would have to wait for PvP. Grid felt both disappointed and relieved. Truth be told, beating Kraugel was far from guaranteed.\n\n*Then I'll enter an event where gold is certain.*\n\nWhich one? Obviously—\n\n\"I'll do PvP and blacksmithing.\"\n\nPeople would mock him for taking the easy route, accuse him of dodging Kraugel.\n\n*Let them laugh.*\n\nCritics would find fault regardless. His decision made, Grid checked Yura's selections—and froze. She'd chosen target processing and saint sword drawing. Target processing was a major event, notorious for its depth of talent. And she knew Kraugel was entering saint sword drawing. Why take that risk?\n\nYura read their confusion.\n\n\"We need to challenge gold-medal contenders to boost South Korea's overall ranking.\"\n\nGrid understood her intent.\n\n\"But what about the odds? Yura, you're one of our strongest. If you don't medal, the impact—mmph! Mmph!\"\n\nGrid clamped a hand over Peak Sword's mouth. He met Yura's unwavering gaze with a smile.\n\n\"Did hell make you that strong?\" Strong enough to match Kraugel. \"I'll trust you. Good luck.\"\n\nGrid had never known Yura to bluff. Her confidence was genuine.\n\n\"Thank you. I won't let you down.\"\n\nYura smiled—a sight so radiant Grid felt his cheeks warm.\n\nThen Eat Spicy Jokbal spoke up. \"My crew and I are taking two team events.\"\n\n\"Oh, excellent!\"\n\nPeak Sword finally wrenched free from Grid's grasp and pumped his fist. He had high hopes for the Dungeon Maker's skills in team competitions. The world expected South Korea to rank dead last, but Peak Sword disagreed.\n\n*We're taking first place this year!*\n\nAnother voice joined in—tentative, but determined.\n\n\"I'll try for at least bronze.\"\n\nToon, the beast master who'd guarded Grid since immigrating last year.\n\n\"Puhahaha! Go South Korea!\"\n\nPeak Sword was practically dancing. He hadn't even decided which events he'd enter yet."
