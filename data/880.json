  "content": "Coke squirmed like he'd sat on a bed of nails.\n\n*What am I missing here?*\n\nGrid had just announced that when the truce ended, a young knight would knock down every Red Knight in the empire. And he'd been pointing straight at Coke when he said it. The problem? Coke was the weakest person in the room.\n\n*Wait—maybe he meant Royman?* Coke glanced left, searching for an escape from this madness. *Yeah, I must've misunderstood!*\n\nBut Royman was staring right back at him. So were the other knights. Every eye in the room had locked onto Coke.\n\n*Shit, he actually means me.*\n\nHis pulse hammered. *I'm supposed to destroy the Red Knights? How? Why?*\n\n*Oh.* Relief washed over him. *It's a joke. Has to be.*\n\nGrid's hand settled on his shoulder, heavy with intent. \"Don't be scared. We have time. I'll show you what it really means to be overgeared.\"\n\nThe words hit Coke like cold water. Grid wasn't joking. Coke had studied his idol long enough to read the signs—the steel in his gaze, the set of his jaw. Grid only looked like that when he meant every word.\n\n*Does he actually believe I can take them?*\n\nCoke swallowed. He'd seen the items Grid created. Knew their power. But still—the Red Knights? His throat tightened. He wanted to live up to Grid's faith in him. Wanted it desperately. But the gap between wanting and achieving felt insurmountable.\n\n\"How interesting.\" Prince Dulandal's voice dripped with contempt. \"I never imagined anyone would bluff so shamelessly in my presence. Truly entertaining. Tell me—is your actual class Clown?\"\n\nHis mocking gaze slid from Grid to Coke. \"The poor lamb's already trembling. Like a calf on the way to slaughter.\"\n\nThe prince didn't see Coke as a threat. Didn't see him at all, really.\n\n*And why would he?* Coke clenched his fists. Sure, he was the best of the second generation rookies. Talented, even. But the Red Knights? They were legends. High rankers who'd started a year before him still feared them.\n\n*Maybe in a few years,* Coke thought bitterly. *But now?*\n\nSo why? Why did Grid have such faith in him?\n\n\"Seems funny now,\" Grid said, unruffled. \"But wait until he's properly overgeared.\"\n\nUnderstanding struck like lightning. *He doesn't trust me—he trusts his items.* The realization should have stung. Instead, warmth spread through Coke's chest. *He has the confidence to forge the perfect knight.*\n\nOnly a legendary blacksmith could possess such absolute certainty.\n\nThe anxiety crushing Coke's lungs lifted. Excitement rushed in to fill the void. *How strong could I become? Could Grid's items really bridge that impossible gap?*\n\n\"Overgeared?\" Dulandal's lip curled. \"Absurd. This conversation wastes my time.\"\n\nHe clicked his tongue and turned away, but not before delivering his parting shot. \"Remember this. Next time you forget your manners, I'll separate your head from your shoulders.\"\n\nThe imperial bloodline deserved respect from every soul on the continent. To Dulandal, Grid's rudeness was an unforgivable insult. Only his father's truce stayed his hand. Defying the emperor's peace would be tantamount to treason.\n\n*Today's restraint will earn His Majesty's favor. My position grows stronger.*\n\nDulandal smiled with satisfaction and strode off.\n\nGrid watched him go, shoulders relaxed. *All that buildup, and he's just... ordinary.*\n\nThe prince was strong enough to trigger Grid's fighting energy, sure. But that was it. Nothing like the suffocating pressure Grid felt around the emperor himself.\n\n*Weaker than his father. Let's hope the other princes follow suit.*\n\nThe empire would be manageable if its heirs lacked their father's teeth.\n\n\"Your Majesty...\"\n\nMercedes waited until Dulandal disappeared around the corner. Worry shadowed her features.\n\n\"I heard about Sir Coke's performance last night. He shows promise, but declaring he'll defeat the Red Knights? That's premature.\"\n\nShe'd seen Grid's work—the sword and armor he'd given her performed beyond expectation. With Grid's items, perhaps Coke could surprise them. But the Red Knights weren't ordinary warriors. They were geniuses culled from tens of thousands of nobles, trained in swordsmanship that had dominated the continent for centuries, enhanced by red energy's mystical power.\n\n*And the new generation will receive the grandmaster's teachings directly.*\n\nMercedes had witnessed Susan's cunning firsthand. That confidence wasn't hollow.\n\n\"Try not to worry. But what's a grandmaster, exactly?\"\n\nMercedes' expression shifted—something between confusion and concern. Grid had carved out a kingdom through sheer force of will, earned a hero's recognition from even the emperor himself. His greatness was undeniable. Which only made Mercedes worry more. Had his recent success blinded him to reality?\n\nShe couldn't quite hide the frost in her voice. \"The grandmaster has achieved mastery in martial arts, magic, and academics.\"\n\n\"All three?\" Grid blinked.\n\n*So basically a jack of all trades?*\n\nThat struck close to home. Grid was the definition of a jack of all trades—blacksmithing, swordsmanship, magic, tailoring. He could do more than most players dreamed of.\n\n*But none of it goes deep.*\n\nHis blacksmithing was exceptional. Everything else? His swordsmanship remained locked to sword dance sequences with frustrating cooldowns. His magic suffered from low intelligence. He could swap to Belial's Staff when necessary, but his tailoring hadn't even reached advanced level yet.\n\nHe'd beaten powerful enemies through variety—items, titles, fraudulent skills. Not through mastery.\n\n*This grandmaster's probably like me. Excellent at one thing, mediocre at the rest.*\n\n\"I don't use the word 'mastered' lightly,\" Mercedes said firmly. \"The grandmaster excels in *every* area. Never underestimate him.\"\n\nGrid frowned. \"Define 'excels.' Can he outfight a Sword Saint? Outcast a great magician? Outsmart a sage?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\n\"No current Sword Saint or great magician can match him. And since he has unrestricted access to the imperial library, his knowledge likely surpasses even Sage Sticks.\"\n\nGrid's jaw worked. Okay, fine—Kraugel had only recently become a Sword Saint. Player limitations meant he was weaker than previous generations. Same for the great magicians; no legends among them. The grandmaster being stronger made a twisted kind of sense.\n\nBut more knowledgeable than Sticks?\n\n\"If the grandmaster had been monitoring events in the empire,\" Mercedes continued, \"Astaroth's schemes would've been exposed before they began. And if he'd been in the palace when Astaroth revealed himself...\"\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"Astaroth would've been ashes before summoning his Storm Demonic Energy Field.\"\n\nThe imperial princes' fearlessness toward legends and great demons suddenly made sense. They'd been raised under the grandmaster's shadow.\n\n\"The Magic King once said the Undefeated King was the only one who could fight the grandmaster as an equal. The day the grandmaster reveals himself to history, a new legend will be born.\"\n\nSilence stretched between them.\n\nMercedes saw Grid's alertness sharpen. \"The new Red Knights training under him directly aren't to be underestimated.\"\n\nGrid stayed quiet for a long moment before shrugging. \"You're mistaken about something.\"\n\n\"Am I?\"\n\n\"I'm not underestimating the Red Knights.\" How could he? Mercedes herself had trained them, and now they were even stronger. \"I'm just saying my items are better.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"I've been waiting, Overgeared King.\"\n\nThey'd reached the banquet hall. Grid followed the elders' directions to find himself seated across from Prince Dulandal. The table groaned under a spread of delicacies. Dulandal's expression remained sour—he clearly couldn't fathom why the elders were treating Grid so well.\n\n*What am I?* Grid thought tiredly. *Just a blacksmith.*\n\nThe titles—Hero King, Great Magician, First King—were window dressing. All Grid wanted was to get back to his forge, hammer in hand, and start working on that sword.\n\nThis lunch couldn't end fast enough.\n\n***\n\nThat evening, after the royalty and imperial prince had departed, Grid made his way to a small smithy tucked in a forgotten corner of the Vatican.\n\nThe holy sword had dimmed noticeably since morning. The Stone of Original Sin's petrification was accelerating.\n\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Item Disassembly!\"\n\nFirst, he needed to understand the holy sword completely. As it broke apart before his eyes, Damian showed no anxiety.\n\nHe simply believed."
