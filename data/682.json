  "content": "\"T-That method...!\"\n\nGrid wasn't going to break the barrier—he was going to match Kruger's production with his own! Sticks felt a surge of admiration at the audacity of it. Every time he thought he understood Grid's limits, the man shattered them. But admiration quickly gave way to alarm.\n\n'No—this is wrong! It goes against everything I know!'\n\nBreaking the barrier was the answer. Had to be. Without it, Kruger could produce items indefinitely, each one amplifying his power. But with the barrier down, those deadly needles would be all the death knight could wield—and Grid would dismantle him eventually.\n\nYet Grid hadn't even considered it.\n\nTo be fair, Grid's reasoning was sound. Kruger existed within the system's protection—an absolute that most players, Grid included, wouldn't dream of challenging. The longer this fight dragged on, the more items Kruger would craft, and the stronger he'd become. Eventually, the 63rd island would prove insurmountable.\n\nThe difficulty was staggering. Kruger demanded far more than Lantier or Alex, who'd simply tried to overwhelm Grid through brute force. Just as the Hell Gao raid had required discovering the fire stones, this encounter needed the right key to unlock victory.\n\nBut Grid's thoughts ran on an entirely different track.\n\n'He's nothing.'\n\nNot bravado. Not desperation. Simple fact.\n\nFrom Grid's perspective, Kruger presented barely a challenge at all. Why? Because Grid wielded ultimate magic—enhanced Alarm and Magic Missile. And the death knight was graciously giving him ten, twenty minutes to prepare.\n\nHis growth since the Belial raid had been explosive. The class quests, the armored elite troops of Belto Kingdom, the 62nd island—all of it had pushed him to level 348. His intelligence sat at 2,260. Base mana: 13,560. Applied intelligence pushed it near 20,000.\n\nA bottomless well.\n\n'Alarm level three. Fifteen-second cooldown.'\n\nWith his cooldown-reducing equipment factored in, he could theoretically prepare eighty Alarm-enhanced Magic Missiles in twenty minutes. Especially with Reidan's alchemy facility keeping him stocked with premium mana potions.\n\nThe moment Kruger finished his latest creation and the barrier fell? A devastating bombardment would erase him.\n\nGrid was confident he could end this whenever he chose. Which meant he could afford to take risks. To try something new.\n\n'I'll make an item too.'\n\nHe was a legend, same as Kruger. If a death knight could produce something in ten or twenty minutes, so could Grid. Time to put theory into practice.\n\n'I learned this at the 2nd National Competition.'\n\nThe realization had stunned him. While Grid labored over items for days, other blacksmiths needed only minutes or hours. At first, he'd dismissed them—how could anything meaningful emerge from such rushed work?\n\nBut the results spoke for themselves. Top-ranking blacksmiths consistently produced superior items in a fraction of the time.\n\nThat's when Grid understood. Time invested didn't guarantee quality.\n\n'It's probability.'\n\nA numbers game. Sure, more time increased the odds of a higher rating. But—\n\n'Speed and volume can match those odds.'\n\nHis mass production set proved it. He'd churned out rare and epic items at factory pace.\n\nNot that he'd abandon his craftsmanship entirely. Grid knew the ultimate items demanded time. But he couldn't ignore the value of rapid production anymore.\n\n'I need both.'\n\nSpeed didn't automatically mean inferior quality. Kruger was proving that right now.\n\n\"Me too...\"\n\n*Kkuok!*\n\nGrid shoved white phosphorus wood into his portable furnace. Hammer in hand, he watched the temperature climb.\n\n\"I'll become a factory too!\"\n\nToo much artistry could hobble you. Time to shed that limitation. Time to evolve. Grid resolved to tear out that deeply rooted perfectionism.\n\n**[Kruger has 18 minutes remaining.]**\n\nThe portable furnace's temperature spiked rapidly. By the time Kruger finished cutting two fabric pieces, Grid's flames had already reached optimal heat. Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship Skill was brutally efficient, and Grid had mastered the bellows long ago.\n\n\"Eighteen minutes. One item!\"\n\nSomething that would turn the tide immediately. What, though? \n\nGrid already knew. His experience had honed his instincts for this work.\n\n\"A weapon to shatter every bone in Kruger's body!\"\n\nCompeting against a legendary tailor. The thought electrified him.\n\nGrid plunged his hand into his inventory and withdrew a crimson bead—a relic from his newbie days. The Red Lightning Summoning Bead, claimed from the frostlight orc chief so long ago.\n\n**[Red Lightning Summoning Bead]**  \n**The power of a frostlight orc shaman dwells in this bead.**  \n**Can summon red lightning from the sky. Temporarily increases the attack power of the weapon struck by this lightning bolt and gives the weapon an electrical attribute.**  \n***It takes one minute to summon the lightning bolt, and the summoner's health will drop by 10% after each summoning.**  \n**Weight: 50**\n\n\"Been a while, old friend.\"\n\nHe'd shelved it as enemies grew stronger. One minute to summon? Ten percent health cost? All for a measly ten percent weapon attack boost, not total attack? The penalties had outweighed the benefits.\n\nBut Grid had been nursing an idea. What if the bead wasn't consumable—what if it became permanent? Integrated into a weapon as crafting material?\n\nAn unrealistic fantasy, back then. The bead wasn't classified as a production material. Grid couldn't have used it for forging.\n\nBut now he had Item Reconstruction.\n\nThe moment he'd acquired that skill, he'd earmarked the Red Lightning Summoning Bead. And now was the perfect time.\n\n'Undead weakness: lightning.'\n\nThe bead detonated on impact. If he could fuse it with the Enlightenment Blade, the weapon would gain devastating anti-undead properties.\n\nMore importantly, Kruger was only defending against the blade's black flames. He'd have zero preparation for a lightning attribute that didn't currently exist.\n\nHitting Kruger with it now?\n\n'Sucker punch.'\n\nGrid grinned as he pulled up the skill window.\n\n**[Legendary Blacksmith's Reconstruction Lv. 1]**  \n**Current experience 63.2%.**  \n**Reinterpret items with 100% understanding into a new form.**  \n**The performance of the modified item will depend on your interpretation, skill, and intentions.**  \n***An item can only be reconstructed once.**  \n***When the skill level increases, the number of reconstructions will increase by one.**\n\nAll requirements met. The Enlightenment Sword was his creation—100% understanding guaranteed. The catch: one reconstruction only.\n\n'Careful.'\n\nHe reconsidered. Was fusing the Red Lightning Summoning Bead worth the permanent modification slot?\n\nYes. Absolutely. The black flames already made it formidable. Adding lightning would only amplify that.\n\n'And the skill will hit level two eventually.'\n\nMore reconstructions would unlock. No reason to hesitate.\n\nGrid separated the Enlightenment Blade from Sword Ghost and hurled both weapon and bead into the furnace.\n\n*Peeeeeong!*\n\nThe explosion rocked the furnace. Flames from the blade. Lightning from the bead. The ground trembled beneath Grid's feet.\n\n*Clack.*\n\n*Claack.*\n\nKruger glanced toward the commotion while cutting his cloth.\n\nIf he'd been alive, that would've triggered alarm—Grid was introducing a variable, after all. But death knights didn't think. After a moment, Kruger's attention returned to his work.\n\nThen—\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nHammer strikes rang across the silent 63rd island.\n\nGrid yanked the Enlightenment Blade and bead from the furnace before they could lose form and hammered with manic speed.\n\n'Modifying Lifael's Spear took about as long as creating something new.'\n\nBut watching Kruger had shown him the truth—he was too slow.\n\nItem Reconstruction was meant to be *active*. Real-time battlefield modifications. That's where its value lived.\n\n'Factory speed. Finish in a flash!'\n\nEighteen minutes evaporated.\n\n*Paaaat!*\n\nThe barrier around Kruger vanished.\n\n**[Kruger has finished making the item!]**\n\nA notification flashed.\n\n*Taack!*\n\nKruger moved instantly. Just as Grid had recovered health and mana while forging, his cooldowns reset, the death knight's health gauge had refilled.\n\n\"Let's see what you made.\"\n\n*Ttang!*\n\nGrid struck the red-blinking blade one final time. The God Hands intercepted Kruger's opening assault as Grid shifted stance.\n\n\"**Link.**\"\n\n*Pajik!*\n\nThe blade flared crimson—the Enlightenment Sword, but transformed. Electrical sparks danced across the metal with each pulse of red light.\n\n*Pit!*\n\n*Pipipipipit!*\n\n\"...!\"\n\n*Kwang!*\n\n*Ku kwa kwa kwa kwa! Ku kwa kwa kwa kwa!*\n\nA maelstrom of crimson light consumed Kruger. The cloth wrappings blocked the flames, absorbed the dark energy, partially filtered the black fire—\n\n*Jjeejeeeong!*\n\nRed lightning struck.\n\n*Duk!*\n\n*Duduk!*\n\nKruger's bones rattled from the electric shock.\n\nThe moment a past legend fell before the present.\n\nWere the former legends weaker because they weren't whole? No. Grid wasn't complete as a legend either. The present generation hadn't matured yet.\n\nSimply put: the new generation surpassed the old."
