  "content": "\"The scorching torment of this accursed sun tests the very limits of my ancient soul.\"\n\n\"Kukukuk! Such is the burden we evil eyes must bear—observed by countless eyes, exhausted by the weight of our own magnificence.\"\n\n\"How I long to rest beneath cooling shadows and feel the caress of the wind's blessing. Huhut.\"\n\nTranslation: they wanted a break.\n\nAfter four days traveling with the evil eyes, Grid had developed an almost supernatural ability to decode their theatrical ravings. Years of enduring Lauel's dramatics had prepared him well.\n\n\"We just stopped an hour ago. Keep moving.\"\n\nThe evil eyes' stamina was abysmal. Every ten kilometers, they'd demand another rest stop, turning what should have been a three-day journey into an endless slog.\n\n'At this rate, we'll never reach their village.'\n\nThe settlement lay somewhere in the Gauss Kingdom's territory—close to the Overgeared Kingdom, which had initially thrilled Grid. But proximity meant nothing when your companions gasped for breath after walking the equivalent of a city block.\n\n'Four days in and we're barely halfway there...'\n\nIf he'd known it would be like this, he would've dragged Sticks along. As Grid mentally cursed his lack of Mass Teleport, Braham's voice echoed in his mind.\n\n'Stop whining and appreciate the opportunity. Few humans ever get to spend this much time with evil eyes. Yes, they're insufferable, but try to see the value in it.'\n\n\"You actually know about the evil eyes?\"\n\n'Of course. Like vampires, they're demonkin who were exiled from Hell. Though the reasons for their banishment were... considerably different.'\n\nGrid couldn't resist. \"Let me guess—they talked too much?\"\n\n'Precisely. The great demons couldn't stand another minute of their constant monologuing. Eventually, they just threw them out.'\n\n\"You're joking.\"\n\n'I wish I were.'\n\nGrid stared at the evil eyes resting beneath a tree, suddenly understanding their tragic history. Braham continued.\n\n'Though in retrospect, it worked out well for humanity. Evil eyes are dangerously powerful. If they'd remained in Hell serving the great demons, we'd all be doomed. Their exile was a blessing in disguise.'\n\n'High praise coming from Braham.'\n\nGrid had suspected the evil eyes were formidable, but hearing Braham confirm it solidified his assessment. Still, they were no threat to him personally.\n\nAs Grid conversed with Braham, the evil eyes watched him from beneath their shady refuge.\n\n\"Truly, this Grid is an extraordinary human. He has achieved communion with his inner self—a dialogue with his own ego. Even among our kind, such mastery is rare.\"\n\n\"I can only admire him. Many possess the capacity to sense their inner consciousness, yet few can truly converse with it.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nWere they comparing him to themselves? Grid's stomach twisted uncomfortably. He couldn't exactly argue—standing there having a conversation with a soul only he could hear probably did look unhinged.\n\n'Damn it.'\n\nHis face burned with embarrassment. What he didn't realize was that his affinity with the evil eyes was skyrocketing. They recognized a kindred spirit—someone who understood their theatrical nature. He had Lauel and Braham to thank for that immunity.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\n'I want to go home...'\n\nMinor was dying inside. Every exchange between Grid and the evil eyes made him physically cringe. His hands curled into fists. Cold sweat dripped down his face. His head pounded.\n\nThe evil eyes weren't just dramatic—they were psychically painful to ordinary people. There was a reason they were classified as demonkin.\n\n***\n\n\"How the hell did I get stuck with this assignment?\"\n\nAmore—level 303 knight of the Gauss Kingdom—stared at the village he'd been ordered to protect. Rice paddies stretched in every direction. The stench of manure hung thick in the air.\n\n'I'm an elite. I killed thirty-four Overgeared soldiers at Borneo. And they send me here?'\n\nDuring the battle for Borneo, he'd been instrumental in picking off defenders on the walls. He was an ace. Yet here he stood, surrounded by farmland.\n\nAs he grumbled, Baron Weston—the local lord—approached with an ingratiating smile.\n\n\"Sir Amore, what an honor to have you here.\"\n\n\"The honor is mine, Baron.\" Despite his irritation, Amore maintained his knightly courtesy. Professionalism was the foundation of his class.\n\nBaron Weston seemed pleased. \"I requested assistance from the Crown due to recent demonkin sightings in the area. I need you to eliminate them.\"\n\n\"Demonkin?\" Amore's attention sharpened. Demonkin weren't ordinary monsters—they were denizens of Hell. Their presence in the mortal world was never a good sign. \"Vampires?\"\n\nVampires were the most commonly encountered demonkin. But Baron Weston shook his head.\n\n\"No. These are... different. Strange creatures with rotund bodies.\"\n\n\"Rotund...?\"\n\nWhat kind of horror was he describing? Amore frowned. \"What damage have they caused?\"\n\nHe expected the usual litany—theft, arson, kidnapping, murder. Demonkin excelled at atrocity.\n\nInstead, Baron Weston said, \"They make people extremely uncomfortable by saying bizarre things.\"\n\n\"...Excuse me?\"\n\n\"They speak nonsense. After listening to them, villagers find their hands and feet curling up. They can't work properly for hours afterward.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, what?\"\n\nThe explanation made no sense. Amore's confusion deepened.\n\n'What kind of demonkin are these?'\n\nHe'd been irritated about the assignment. Now he was just baffled. Still, the quest was S-rank with exceptional rewards—and more importantly, it was a royal order. Refusing wasn't an option.\n\n\"So I just need to eliminate them?\"\n\n\"Exactly. I'm counting on you, Sir Amore.\"\n\nAfter the baron departed, Amore surveyed the village. Understanding the terrain and local patterns would be essential for hunting the demonkin.\n\n'This place is tiny.'\n\nMaybe a thousand residents, and not a single other player. As Amore completed his reconnaissance, he suddenly froze.\n\nA group stood at the village entrance—visible even in the growing darkness.\n\n'Already?'\n\nHe'd only accepted the quest half a day ago, and here they were? Nineteen figures approached the sleeping village. Amore slipped into an alley, watching carefully.\n\n'Rotund...!'\n\nSeventeen of the creatures matched the baron's description perfectly—spherical bodies, oversized eyes, childlike faces that were almost... cute. Two humans accompanied them: an NPC named Minor and another whose face was hidden, either NPC or player.\n\n'These must be the demonkin.'\n\nThey were far less horrifying than he'd imagined.\n\n'Doesn't matter.'\n\nHis mission was elimination. Finding all seventeen targets immediately was incredible luck.\n\n'If I kill them all, the reward will be massive.'\n\nThis was his chance to prove himself—to escape frontier duty and return to real combat.\n\nAmore's hand moved to his sword hilt, ready to strike. At level 303, seventeen of these pudgy creatures should be manageable. And if he rescued those humans from captivity...\n\n'Bonus quest chains, guaranteed.'\n\nHe smiled.\n\nThen one of the demonkin spoke.\n\n\"Behold—this tranquil village bathed in moonlight soothes my weary traveler's heart. The feral instinct sealed within my eye, shrouded in darkness, drinks deeply of this beautiful night.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nAnother chimed in. \"The fog stirs a chill within my ancient soul. I feel my power awakening. Tonight, when my mind is clear and my strength surges, I am truly immeasurable and unimaginable.\"\n\n\"???\"\n\nA third added, \"But beware. The cruel flames rising from my eyes may seal away the sin of your cold gaze.\"\n\n\"????\"\n\nAmore's body seized up. His fingers, wrapped around his sword hilt, went rigid and useless. His feet refused to move.\n\n\"What... what the hell...?\"\n\nThis must be the curse Baron Weston mentioned—the shriveling of hands and feet. Amore understood now. He couldn't bring himself to attack these demonkin anymore, even though they'd seemed so weak moments ago. If he couldn't even resist their words, what chance did he have in combat?\n\n'E-Earplugs. I need earplugs!'\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nAmore blinked. The group had vanished—seventeen demonkin and two humans, gone without a trace.\n\n\"Demons...\"\n\nLiteral ghosts. Terrifying.\n\nHe seriously considered abandoning the quest.\n\n***\n\n[You have entered the Evil Eyes Village!]\n\n[You are the first discoverer of the Evil Eyes Village.]\n\n[For the next 10 days, your chance of discovering hidden quests and quest rewards are increased.]\n\n'Finally!'\n\nGrid's excitement surged at the notification. A first discoverer achievement—just like Kraugel would get. It felt good to be a pioneer for once.\n\n'This place is actually nice.'\n\nDespite standing in a village full of demonkin, Grid felt no fear. His composure impressed Minor, who stood trembling beside him, fighting to keep his legs steady. Grid felt a flash of pride for the kid.\n\n\"Behold—the dwelling place of our sovereign: the Dark Flame White Ice Castle. Huhut.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nPerhaps because the evil eyes themselves were small, the \"castle\" at the center of their charming settlement was barely larger than a manor house. The gate stood maybe 160 centimeters tall—Grid had to duck to enter.\n\nInside, evil eye ministers waited.\n\n\"So this is the human who helped secure the light dragon egg? Impressive, for a mortal.\"\n\n\"Yet does he possess the qualifications to stand before our great king—who commands dark flames and white ice, who perceives the truth of all creation?\"\n\n\"We cannot be too careful. Our king is an absolute being who can claim life and destiny with a mere glance. An unworthy soul who meets his gaze will fall into eternal damnation. You must be tested. Submit.\"\n\n[You have made eye contact with an Evil Eye.]\n\n[You have been afflicted with 'Submissive' status.]\n\n[You resisted.]\n\n[Due to the effect of the 'First King' title, 'Great King's Majesty' has activated.]\n\n[You have counterattacked the status effect.]\n\n\"Kukuk! Magnificent human! We welcome you to our great king's presence.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThey were off in their own world. Rather than cringing, Grid simply walked into the great hall.\n\nIt was time to meet the Evil Eyes King—the one even Braham respected."
