  "content": "Grid stared at the glowing hammer, his fingers trembling. \"Wow. Plus ten.\"\n\nMaximum enhancement. He'd never even considered it a goal. The wealthy heirs across the world couldn't achieve it. What chance did he have?\n\n*How can I get to plus ten?*\n\nHe remembered reading a post from some rich player who'd burned billions of won on enhancement stones. The statistics were brutal: if you were lucky enough to reach +7, you had a 0.01% chance of success for the next level. Failure? 99.9%. \n\nNobody could push past +7 through brute force alone. The success rates only got worse at +8 and +9. Even the ultra-rich gave up. Instead, they aimed for +6 items, then used blessed enhancement stones to gamble for +9. Some tried over a thousand times for a single success.\n\nYet here Grid stood. Not a wealthy heir. Just a debtor with a legendary class.\n\n*The passive skill.* Grid's chest tightened. *'Increase the probability of item enhancement.' It actually works.*\n\n\"I have almost 100% success rate up to plus five,\" he muttered.\n\nMost players found +5 easy enough. But +6 started introducing failure. Some players tasted that frustration early. Grid never did. He always succeeded up to +5. He'd complained every day about his bad luck, but he'd been riding the passive effect this whole time.\n\nHis hand moved to his chest.\n\n*Thump thump thump thump.*\n\nThe moment reality struck him, his heart began hammering against his ribs. Sweat erupted across his skin. His breathing turned ragged. Was this joy? He couldn't even feel it. His mind went blank, too overwhelmed for excitement.\n\nBraham watched in silence. Ultimate enhancement. Pagma had accomplished this feat several times in his life. No matter how Braham felt about the current Grid, he wanted to give the man a chance to savor this moment.\n\nAfter several long seconds, Grid's breathing steadied. \"Hah... Hah...\" His eyes began to shine. \"I did it! I did it!\"\n\nHe jumped forward, fist raised. For once in his miserable life, he'd fought against his cursed luck and won. Of course, the universe would probably balance this good fortune with greater misfortune later.\n\n*That doesn't matter.* Grid clenched his jaw. *I'll just overcome it again.*\n\nHe pulled up the item window.\n\n---\n\n> **[Ultimate Enhanced Mjolnir - Human World Version]**  \n> Rating: Legendary  \n> Durability: 689/689  \n> Attack Power: 1,333~2,363  \n> \n> * Accuracy +50%  \n> * Acceleration increases when thrown  \n> * Each hit inflicts 0.3 seconds of Stiffness  \n> * Destroys durability of struck objects (excluding your own items)  \n> * Deals 3,800 fixed damage to demonkin and undead  \n> * High chance to induce 'Fear' status in hostile targets  \n> * Dramatically increases workmanship speed of blacksmith skills  \n> * Magic Detection (Enhanced) attached  \n> \n> *An unprecedented achievement. The hammer that will shatter legends.*\n\n---\n\nEnhancement was difficult. The overwhelming probability of failure, the risk of losing millions of won, it burdened ordinary people beyond measure. But there was a reason players clung to it despite the odds. Each enhancement level increased an item's stats by 5 to 7%.\n\n\"This is insane.\" Grid studied the numbers. The attack power and option increases were enormous. The minimum damage was 1,333. That exceeded most legendary weapons at +6.\n\n*I've overcome the limitation of blunt weapons.* He nodded slowly. Even if only the minimum attack power triggered, it would inflict massive damage. The major drawback of Mjolnir, that gap between minimum and maximum, had been crushed by the high enhancement value.\n\n*Worth it.* \n\nTwenty-nine days in the smithy. Creating all four Mjolnirs at legendary rating. The pain had driven him to the brink of giving up countless times. But he'd persevered. Repeated production, destruction, production, destruction. All four hammers finally achieved legendary rating. In the process, one of the drake's fangs had shattered. The remaining adamantium had reached its durability limit.\n\nNow one of them sat at +10.\n\nGrid felt genuine happiness. Pure, unfiltered joy.\n\n*I have to work even harder.*\n\nHis motivation blazed like a furnace.\n\n> [The cooldown of the skill 'Summon Sword Demon Iyarugt' has returned.]\n\nGrid's expression shifted. \"Perfect timing.\"\n\nA chance to test the weapon. He grinned wickedly and headed for the training ground.\n\n---\n\n**The Abyss**\n\nIyarugt's soul churned with indignation.\n\n*How can Hell's best swordsman be defeated by a human?* \n\nImpossible. He blamed his sealed strength. He needed to regain his power quickly. But before that, his plan to tame Grid remained intact. If he could use Grid, he'd speed up the resurrection considerably.\n\nYet yesterday...\n\n*He's trying to tame me instead.*\n\nYesterday, no enemies had been present when Iyarugt manifested. Grid had summoned him for a one-on-one duel. \n\n*Disgraceful.* \n\nGrid had prepared weapons in advance specifically to fight him.\n\n*You planned this from the beginning.*\n\nDamn bastard. This weak creature. Once Iyarugt regained his original strength...\n\nHis rage mounted. The more he thought about it, the more furious he became. To fall for a human's trap. Humiliating.\n\n*It won't happen again.*\n\nIyarugt would be prepared for the next summoning.\n\n*I'll win if I stay alert.*\n\nHe paused, reconsidering.\n\n*No. It could still be dangerous.*\n\nThose four golden hammers.\n\n*The divine power is too risky.*\n\nThey were surprisingly powerful weapons. If they grew any stronger, they could threaten even the great demons.\n\n*Right now, I can't endure the power of those weapons.*\n\nHe had to fight and win to tame Grid. He was a demon who followed the will of strength. But that meant actually winning.\n\n*To defeat him, I need to neutralize the hammers.*\n\nThe problem: the hammers were nearly impossible to avoid. The four golden hands seemed to swing randomly, but they covered every angle. Was there any way to prevent Grid from using them? \n\nAn idea formed.\n\n*It will hurt my pride.* \n\nBowing his head, then striking when Grid lowered his guard. The most pragmatic approach.\n\n*Very well. Today I'll have revenge for yesterday, then tame Grid every time I'm summoned. Kukukuk!*\n\nIyarugt savored his excitement.\n\nLight pierced the darkness. The summoning.\n\n*Here we go!*\n\nIyarugt's soul rushed toward the light. He borrowed the sword to form a physical body.\n\n\"Sweet.\" He recited the fixed phrase, then bowed toward Grid. \"I apologize for yesterday. I was impolite to initiate combat without cause.\"\n\nAn apology from Hell's best swordsman. Surely Grid would accept it.\n\n*Now he'll ask for a handshake.*\n\nGrid wouldn't be so impolite as to refuse.\n\n*I'll pretend to shake hands, then kick, then...*\n\nPerfect. Revenge would be his.\n\n\"Kukuk—\" Iyarugt's wicked laugh died in his throat. \"What?\"\n\nFour God Hands materialized behind Grid. Each one gripped a golden hammer from yesterday's beating. Grid stared at him with an emotionless expression.\n\n\"I don't like your attitude when apologizing.\"\n\nIyarugt's fury exploded. \"What? Should I have knelt before you? I am Hell's best swordsman! You're just a human!\"\n\n\"I'm not just a human.\" Grid's voice was flat. \"I'm your master.\"\n\n*Pepepepeng!*\n\nThe God Hands launched forward. They swung the hammers through the air with wild precision.\n\n\"Futile!\" Iyarugt snarled.\n\n*Kwaduduk!*\n\nHe ground his teeth together, rage soaring. The golden hammers swung with ignorant force. Difficult to find an escape route. He shifted to pure defense.\n\n*Kaaang!*\n\n\"What?\" Iyarugt blocked one Mjolnir with his blade. The strength radiating from the hammer was overwhelming. He couldn't hold it back.\n\n*Why is the weapon more powerful than yesterday?*\n\nThe Mjolnir he'd just blocked was the +10 version. The result was catastrophic.\n\n> [The demonic sword Iyarugt couldn't withstand the powerful shock. Durability has dropped by 80.]\n\n> [The impact is immense. You will be rigid for 0.3 seconds!]\n\n> [The impact is large. You will be rigid for 0.1 seconds!]\n\n> [You will be rigid for 0.1 seconds!]\n\nUltimate Enhanced Mjolnir boasted 100% accuracy. Anyone struck would be rigid for 0.3 seconds. The other Mjolnirs inflicted 0.1 seconds of stiffness. If they hit in sequence...\n\nInfinite stiffness.\n\nIyarugt died faster than he had yesterday.\n\n\"This... why...\" His voice cracked.\n\nYesterday, he'd had the excuse of being caught off guard by the separating swords. Not today. He'd been completely, utterly defeated. By weapons!\n\n\"Iyarugt fought only against weapons!\" His resentment erupted.\n\nGrid watched the soul begin to be consumed by fire. \"I won. You can't even defeat my weapons. How could you hope to defeat me?\"\n\n\"Don't be absurd! Only your weapons are strong, not you!\"\n\n\"I made the weapons.\" Grid's tone was matter-of-fact. \"Therefore, I am strong.\"\n\nIyarugt fell silent. The logic was difficult to understand, yet impossible to refute. Grid smiled at him. The complete winner's smile. Full of ease.\n\n\"I'll see you again tomorrow. I hope your killing intent actually reaches me next time.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\"\n\nIyarugt's form dissolved completely. He returned to the demonic sword. Grid felt a joy others couldn't comprehend.\n\n*This is incredible.* \n\nBeating an enemy without lifting a finger. Grid savored the power, then turned his gaze toward the vampire cities.\n\n\"I should set a new record while the experience buff lasts.\"\n\nThe seven-person Overgeared elite party had shortened their clear time to five hours. What if he broke that record alone?\n\nIt was possible.\n\nThe moment Grid's leveling myth would shatter the world had arrived."
