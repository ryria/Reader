Pon leaned heavily on his spear, chest heaving. Even Jishuka's usually perfect posture sagged with fatigue.\n\nThey would fail. The Elfin Stone raid had pushed them to their absolute limits, and there was no way they could handle another boss of that caliber. Every member of the party understood this reality.\n\nExcept for Yura.\n\nShe watched Grid's profile as he surveyed the vampire city's ruins. The set of his jaw, the steadiness of his breathing despite the carnage around them. Something had changed in him during the fight. He moved differently now. *He's broken through another wall.*\n\nThis wasn't blind faith born from whatever complicated feelings she harbored toward him. She had walked the path of legend herself, felt the fundamental shift when the system acknowledged you as something beyond ordinary. She understood what Grid was becoming in a way the others couldn't yet grasp.\n\n\"Didn't struggling with the strong help you?\" Yura stepped closer, tilting her head to catch his gaze.\n\nGrid turned. His expression held none of the usual anxiety that plagued him. No fear of failure, no desperate calculations. Just quiet certainty.\n\n\"Yes.\" He nodded slowly. \"It was a very big help.\"\n\n*Hell Gao.* The name burned in Grid's mind like a brand. That great demon sealed by Sword Saint Muller. The boss he'd only managed to defeat through environmental gimmicks and fire stones, not true strength. The memory of that inadequacy had haunted him, a constant reminder of how far he still had to climb.\n\n*But now...* He clenched his fist, feeling the weight of new power settling into his bones. *I could fight him properly. Maybe even win.*\n\nThe thought sent a thrill through him. Soon he would return to Cork Island. He would face Hell Gao again, and this time there would be no tricks. Just Grid and the demon, power against power.\n\n*I have to become the best.*\n\nThe memory of Jishuka's near-death in Bairan flashed through his mind. The helplessness as his friends bled for his inadequacy. Watching people he cared about suffer because he wasn't strong enough.\n\nThat dirty, suffocating feeling. He never wanted to experience it again.\n\nGrid's jaw tightened with resolve. His features held a maturity that hadn't existed even a week ago. The twenty-eight-year-old who used to panic at every setback was dying. Something harder, more refined, was taking his place.\n\nYura's breath caught. She watched the transformation play across his face, imagining what he might become in two years, five years, ten. When age and experience finally caught up to that legendary class power.\n\nHer heart hammered against her ribs.\n\nGrid's eyes snapped to her, and she flinched.\n\n\"But why is your level so low?\" He squinted at her name in the guild interface. \"The 5th-place ranker is only level 203? Have you been scamming people or something?\"\n\nYura blinked. *And there he is.* The socially incompetent Grid, spitting out thoughts without a filter. She fought down a smile. Better this than some smooth-talking pretty boy who spent all his energy on appearance.\n\n\"Check my class.\" She crossed her arms.\n\n\"Class?\" Grid frowned. \"Aren't you a black magician?\"\n\nHe'd only glanced at her level initially, too distracted by the reunion. Now his eyes tracked down the interface to the class designation. His face went slack.\n\n\"Demon Slayer? What... how...?\" His voice climbed an octave. \"L-Legendary?!\"\n\nThe words burst out of him in a strangled yelp. At the press conference after the 1st National Competition, Lim Cheolho had been explicit. Nine legendary classes existed in Satisfy. Just nine, among two billion players.\n\nAnd now Overgeared had two.\n\n\"You are really welcome!\" Grid's face split into a manic grin.\n\nHe lurched forward, arms spreading for an embrace. Yura tensed. Grid froze mid-step, arms still outstretched like a malfunctioning robot. His eyes darted to the side as his brain caught up to his body. Slowly, mechanically, he lowered his arms.\n\n*Right. Sexual harassment lawsuit. Bad idea.* He coughed into his fist and looked anywhere but at Yura.\n\n\"Anyway. Welcome to the guild,\" he muttered.\n\n***\n\nEighty-four days.\n\nGrid stared at the quest timer as he, Yura, and Huroi departed Reidan. Time enough to secure the remaining pavranium from thirteen more vampire cities. City 13 had been the most difficult by all accounts. Its lord, Elfin Stone, had pushed them to the brink of failure. With Yura's legendary class added to their forces, the remaining cities should fall easier.\n\n*Should.*\n\nGrid had learned not to trust \"should\" in Satisfy.\n\n***\n\nDeep beneath the 13th vampire city, in chambers where sunlight would never reach, the surviving Overgeared members picked through the darkness.\n\n\"The torches are gone.\" Peak Sword shook an empty brand, its oiled wrapping long since consumed.\n\n\"Should have packed more.\" Zednos conjured a small flame in his palm, barely enough to illuminate his own face.\n\nVantner groaned. \"You're a third advancement magician and you can't even manage a basic light spell?\"\n\n\"I only learned wind magic.\" Zednos's flame guttered out as his concentration lapsed.\n\n\"Every mage should know the basics, regardless of specialization.\" Jishuka nocked an arrow by touch alone, her ranger senses compensating for the darkness.\n\n\"I'm pursuing a singular path.\" Zednos's voice carried a stubborn edge. \"Specialization might trigger a hidden class evolution. You never know.\"\n\n\"Or you could just learn Light Sphere like a normal person.\" Peak Sword stumbled over loose rubble. \"Should we call in Minor? The kid could probably sniff out pavranium from a mile away.\"\n\n\"Let's search a bit longer.\"\n\nFour hours crawled by. They eliminated scattered vampire familiars, weak remnants that hadn't fled with the city's destruction. The architecture grew older as they descended, cyclopean stonework replacing the Gothic excess of the upper levels.\n\nThen Vantner's boot struck something hollow.\n\n\"This seems like it.\" He ran his hands over the stone, feeling the geometric precision of worked edges. \"There's a seam here.\"\n\nThe wall crumbled under his enhanced strength, revealing a cave mouth that exhaled stale air. The party exchanged glances and filed inside.\n\n> [The Guardian of the Labyrinth has detected an intruder and woken up from a long sleep.]\n> \n> [The traps have been activated.]\n\n*Papapapaт!*\n\nArrows screamed from concealed ports in the ceiling. Spikes erupted from the floor. Lightning arced between the walls in a web of killing current, its intensity surpassing most player magicians.\n\nIn the past, Grid had nearly died to Braham's traps despite his legendary resilience. But the current Overgeared members had long since surpassed that threshold.\n\n\"Titan.\" Vantner slammed his shield into the ground.\n\n*Kuwaaaaah!*\n\nAn illusory giant materialized around him, translucent and massive. The skill draped its protection over each party member, ghostly armor layering over real. Arrows shattered against invisible barriers. Spikes that should have impaled ankles instead scraped off enhanced defenses.\n\n\"Wind Curtain!\"\n\nZednos swept his arms wide. The Chain Lightning twisted into his vortex, its fury bleeding away into dispersed static.\n\nThey burst through the kill zone with minor injuries. Two figures waited in the chamber beyond.\n\nGolems. Enormous ones.\n\n\"They're huge.\" Vantner tilted his head back to take in their full height. \"Bigger than those ancient weapons that attacked Reinhardt, even.\"\n\n\"These golems...\" Jishuka's eyes narrowed in recognition.\n\n\"They look like the one Grid fought when he found pavranium before,\" Peak Sword finished. \"Just... bigger. Stronger.\"\n\n\"Which means we're definitely in the right place.\" Jishuka drew her bowstring taut.\n\n\"Alright.\" Vantner grinned behind his helmet. \"Let's knock them down.\"\n\nThe Guardians of the Labyrinth stood 150 levels higher than their predecessors. Their combat parameters exceeded even the ancient weapons that had besieged the capital. But the Overgeared members had grown too. Experience refined into instinct. Legendary items stacked with unique skills. The coordination of elites who had bled together.\n\nAgainst all that, simple defensive patterns couldn't save the golems.\n\n\"Defense is solid.\" Pon's spear scraped off hardened stone, leaving only a shallow groove.\n\n\"Target the legs. Topple it.\" Jishuka's arrows struck with surgical precision, finding stress points in the golem's knee joints.\n\n\"Zednos, locate the mana core.\" Peak Sword circled like a predator. \"Mark it, and I'll split it in one draw.\"\n\n*Kururururu!*\n\nTwenty minutes. The guardians possessed immense durability and health pools, but they eventually collapsed in avalanches of shattered stone. The party's faces brightened as minerals scattered across the ground.\n\n*Grid's going to love this.* They could already picture his greedy expression, hands trembling as he catalogued each piece.\n\nThe image was so vivid that the voice in their heads took a moment to register.\n\n> [Now dogs and cows dare touch my things.]\n\nVantner's head snapped up. \"Dog?\"\n\n\"Cow?\" Peak Sword's grip tightened on his sword hilt.\n\n\"He's calling us livestock?\" Jishuka's voice dropped to a dangerous purr.\n\nThey were top-twenty rankers among two billion players. And someone was comparing them to barnyard animals?\n\n\"Who the hell are you to say that?\" Vantner's growl echoed off the chamber walls.\n\n> [I am the great magician Braham.]\n\nSilence. The name hung in the air, weighted with legend and expectation. Braham's soul waited, anticipating the terror that should follow. The groveling. The begging for mercy.\n\n\"A specter from the past.\" Zednos waved dismissively.\n\n\"You installed these traps?\" Jishuka snorted. \"Petty and vindictive. What a charming personality.\"\n\n\"If you're dead, stay dead.\" Peak Sword cleaned his blade with exaggerated care. \"Stop lingering around to harass living people.\"\n\n\"Hand over the pavranium.\" Vantner crossed his arms.\n\n> [You...!]\n\nBraham's rage manifested as pressure, invisible weight crushing down on the party. But they'd faced Malacus, Hell Gao, the Pope himself. A soul without a body barely registered.\n\nBraham had watched these fools through Mumud's Orb when Euphemina stayed in Reidan. He'd seen their casual disrespect, their ignorant confidence. They were perfect reflections of their master.\n\n> [You truly fit together! All of you are just like Pagma's Descendant!]\n\nThat thief. That ungrateful wretch who stole pavranium instead of crafting the Vessel of the Soul. Who even now sent minions to rob Braham's remaining reserves. Unforgivable.\n\n> [I will show you the consequences!]\n\nGrid would suffer when his subordinates died screaming. Braham would make certain of it. He triggered the contingency he'd prepared for Grid's inevitable return.\n\n> [Mumud!]\n\n*Kwajak!*\n\nStone buckled and split. An ornate coffin erupted from the floor, dirt cascading off its engraved surface.\n\n\"Another vampire?\" Vantner readied his shield.\n\n\"What kind of magician summons vampires?\" Peak Sword's confusion was understandable. Wrong genre entirely.\n\nThe coffin lid fell away with a theatrical creak. But the figure that rose from within had no flesh at all.\n\nPure bone, yellowed with age. An empty ribcage that should hold no life. Skeletal fingers clutching an orb that pulsed with sickly light.\n\n\"A skeleton?\" Jishuka frowned. \"Why was a skeleton kept in a coffin?\"\n\nZednos's face drained of color. He stared at the orb, recognition dawning like a death sentence. \"Mumud... that name. I knew it was familiar.\"\n\n\"What?\" The others turned.\n\n\"He was Braham's disciple.\" Zednos took an involuntary step backward. \"That's not a skeleton.\"\n\n\"Then what—\"\n\n\"That's a lich.\"\n\nThe word dropped like a stone into still water. Ripples of understanding, then horror.\n\nA lich. Not some necromancer's cheap summon. A being that transcended death through mastery of magic itself. Infinite mana. Knowledge accumulated over centuries. Power rumored to exceed even the ten great magicians of the continent.\n\n> [Demands are a privilege of the strong.]\n\nBraham's soul flickered with malicious satisfaction.\n\n> [You want my pavranium? You children who don't understand what you face... I will punish you personally.]\n\n*Kiiiiyaaaaaaah!*\n\nThe lich stood. Magic power rolled off it in waves, dense and suffocating. The pressure reminded them of Elfin Stone at full power.\n\n\"Retreat.\" Peak Sword's voice cut through the rising panic. \"We wait for Grid.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" Jishuka was already backpedaling toward the exit. \"No point fighting this exhausted. We regroup and plan.\"\n\nThey'd just survived Elfin Stone. Their resources were depleted, their skills on cooldown. Fighting another boss-tier enemy now would be suicide. Smart players knew when to fold.\n\nThe Overgeared members turned as one toward the cave entrance.\n\n*Step. Step.*\n\nFootsteps echoed from the darkness ahead.\n\n*Grid.* The thought flashed through every mind simultaneously. Their leader always appeared at the perfect moment, like some protagonist blessed with narrative timing. How many times had he saved them at the last second?\n\n\"I finally found it.\" The voice emerged before its owner. \"Lich Mumud.\"\n\nThe party's relief curdled instantly. That voice was familiar, but it wasn't Grid's.\n\n\"Why are there so many guests?\"\n\nA figure materialized from the shadows. Pale green hair swept back from a sharp face. Dead eyes that held all the warmth of a corpse. He studied the Overgeared members with the detached interest of a butcher examining livestock.\n\n\"Look at these third advancement players, running around in a pack.\" His lips curled in contempt. \"Don't any of you know how to play solo?\"\n\nOnly one person could speak with such casual arrogance to the elite Overgeared Guild. One user infamous for his complete disconnection from sanity.\n\nCrazy Person. Mad Dog.\n\n\"Agnus...\" The name left Vantner's mouth like a curse.\n\n***\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms:**\n\nOG: Glossary Link\n\n*Current schedule: 20 chapters a week.*\n\n*Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
