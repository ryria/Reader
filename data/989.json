  "content": "Youngwoo had drunk heavily the night before, but his body barely protested. He'd paced himself carefully—one of the few advantages of self-control.\n\n\"Mother made this for you.\" Jishuka appeared as he woke, offering a bottle of water. She wore casual clothes—*too* casual. Her loose top revealed her collarbone and... other distractions.\n\n\"Th-thanks.\" Youngwoo accepted the bottle, avoiding eye contact.\n\nWaking up to one of the world's most beautiful women should have been a gift. Instead, it felt like a trial by fire. Jishuka watched him drink, a knowing smile playing across her lips. \"Isn't this just like newlyweds? Sharing breakfast together...\"\n\nYoungwoo choked, water spraying from his mouth. He turned toward the window—toward the building Jishuka had finished a few days ago. \"When are you moving in?\"\n\n\"Once the interior work is done. The plaster smell hasn't faded yet, and my furniture from Italy won't arrive for another ten days.\" She leaned closer. \"Are you sad our time together is ending? Should I stay longer?\"\n\n\"No!\" The word came out too quickly. *Please, go soon.*\n\nJishuka's aggressive affection was both thrilling and overwhelming. He'd heard South American women were passionate, but experiencing it every morning was another matter entirely.\n\n\"Your physique improves every year, Grid. You're remarkably disciplined.\" Her fingers traced the definition in his biceps and chest.\n\nYoungwoo reflexively pulled the blanket higher. Jishuka's bright laughter filled the room at his unexpectedly chaste reaction. Her tan skin caught the morning sunlight streaming through the window, and despite himself, Youngwoo found his eyes drawn to the sight.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Sehee appeared in the doorway wearing an apron, her glare sharp enough to cut glass. The disgust in her expression was unmistakable. \"Yura unni is waiting for an answer, and you're *playing around*? You need to give her a clear response before acting like this.\"\n\n\"You're misunderstanding—\"\n\n\"Get dressed and eat breakfast, *playboy*.\"\n\nThe door slammed.\n\nYoungwoo sat in silence, still technically a virgin who'd never even kissed anyone. He rose from bed while Jishuka hummed cheerfully beside him.\n\n***\n\n\"I'm honestly nervous about this.\"\n\nChris had finally made peace with Grid's meteoric rise in the rankings. *Stop clinging to first place. Don't obsess over it.* The decision had brought unexpected relief—hunting no longer felt like obligation. It was fun again. But a new worry had taken root.\n\n\"Rose isn't an easy opponent,\" he said, pacing Lauel's office. \"I think we should avoid provoking her unnecessarily.\"\n\n\"You're not concerned about her individual strength?\" Lauel asked.\n\n\"No. The top rankers in Overgeared could handle her in direct combat. Even if she targeted our non-combatants, we'd be prepared.\" Chris shook his head. \"It's the Yatan Church backing her that worries me.\"\n\n\"The Rebecca Church has been aggressively hunting down Yatan followers since the invasion,\" Lauel countered. \"The Yatan Church doesn't have the capacity to threaten an entire kingdom right now. Rose knows this—that's why she couldn't ask for their cooperation in this incident.\"\n\n\"But she's already summoned a great demon once before.\" Chris stopped pacing. \"What's to stop her from doing it again? If she summons one inside the Overgeared Kingdom out of revenge, the damage would be catastrophic.\"\n\nSummoning great demons was the Yatan Church's primary objective. Another emergence was inevitable—only a matter of time and place.\n\nLauel shook his head. \"She can't summon a great demon within our borders. The ritual requires mass human sacrifice on an enormous scale. Our security is nearly as tight as the empire's—she'd never acquire the necessary victims.\"\n\nSince the kingdom's founding, Overgeared had prioritized security above all else. Guild members patrolled the territories in rotating shifts. Grid's fierce protectiveness toward NPCs ensured no gaps existed in their surveillance. A summoning ritual would be detected immediately.\n\n\"The next great demon will likely appear in a kingdom with weaker security. And besides—demons at Belial's level can't be controlled by Yatan's Servants. Even if Rose performed the summoning, she couldn't deliberately direct the demon against us.\"\n\n\"I see...\" Chris' expression brightened. Anxiety transformed into anticipation, a subtle smile crossing his face.\n\nLauel leaned back in his chair. \"We wait for the summoning. Wherever it happens on the continent, we'll be the first to respond and claim the raid rewards.\"\n\n\"Speaking of Grid—did you watch that video from the food stall?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"His combat evolution is remarkable. Much more refined since the Battlefield event.\"\n\nChris nodded. \"The demon king subjugation was clearly a catalyst. He wasn't just fighting—he was *studying*. The way he scanned those four men's shoulders and feet while talking to the owner, predicted their movements, found gaps in their breathing... then overwhelmed them in seconds. That's not luck. That's experience translating from Satisfy into reality.\"\n\nThey both understood this phenomenon well. Years of accumulated combat experience in Satisfy bled into the real world. Grid was becoming a master in both domains after over a decade of relentless practice.\n\n\"Good news,\" Lauel said, relaxing slightly. Grid having the power to defend himself outside the game was reassuring.\n\n***\n\n**[Your execution day has been decided.]**\n\n**[Four days from now, you will be executed in the capital city of the Glaucian Kingdom.]**\n\n**[Your sins are the murders of seven craftsmen. After execution, your level will be reduced by four and your highest level skill will be reduced by one level.]**\n\n**[After execution, you will be freed from the identity of sinner and liberated from all constraints. However, your affinity won't be restored with the seven kingdoms hostile to you.]**\n\n**[You must remain logged in for at least four hours daily while imprisoned. Failure to meet this condition will increase your punishment.]**\n\nAgnus had spent three days in this damp, fetid dungeon. Four more remained.\n\nOne week of isolation—for a ranker, it was devastating. The execution would cost him months of progress. Yet Agnus blamed no one. Compared to the nightmare his life had been, this was nothing. False accusations? No. This was deserved punishment. He'd harmed many people in his desperate scramble to never be weak again. If he denied responsibility now, even Luna would hate him for it.\n\nLuna. Luina Caroline. His dead lover—his everything. The foundation of whatever conscience he had left.\n\n**[Someone has requested a visit, but the Glaucian Kingdom has rejected it.]**\n\nAll communication was blocked in jail—whispers, mail, everything. No way to know who'd made the request. Even so, his mind went to one person: Euphemina. That strange girl who'd meddled in his business since the Murray Kingdom. She was the only one who might care enough to visit...\n\n\"...No, that's ridiculous. Kukuku.\"\n\nProbably just one of the rankers he'd victimized, come to gloat at his suffering. They'd feel satisfied watching him punished.\n\nAgnus had no allies. It had always been this way. The brief time Luna stood beside him had been precious beyond measure. Now he was alone again—nothing new about that.\n\n**[There are three days left until your execution.]**\n\nOne day passed.\n\n**[There are two days left until your execution.]**\n\nThen another.\n\n**[There is one day left until your execution.]**\n\n**[The morning of your execution has dawned.]**\n\nAgnus completed his daily login requirement locked in that dark, freezing cell. The pain was almost welcome—a way to forget his longing for Luna.\n\n\"Come out.\" The jailers dragged his emaciated body roughly. Chains and handcuffs bound him so tightly he could barely move. A guard shoved him from behind, and his face slammed into dirt. Laughter echoed around him.\n\n\"Kikik.\" Agnus laughed with them. It was grimly amusing—being a criminal felt no different from his weak past. *Weakness is sin. The greatest sin in the world.*\n\n\"Agnus is being escorted!\"\n\nThey locked him in a barred prisoner cart and hauled him toward the execution square. Massive crowds had gathered—top rankers and casual players alike. The execution of one of the world's most infamous rankers was headline news. Countless people had flooded into the Glaucian Kingdom—media reporters, private broadcasters, curious onlookers. Through the thick iron bars, Agnus saw their laughing faces.\n\nHis carefully maintained composure cracked. Tremors wracked his body. The stares of tens of thousands triggered trauma buried deep in his psyche. In this moment, Agnus was weak again—alone among those who laughed and trampled him.\n\n\"Oof...!\" Nausea overwhelmed him. He wanted to run, to *escape*, but the restraints drained his strength and courage.\n\n*'Agnus, remember—you're not alone. I'm there for you. Have courage,'* Luna's voice whispered in his memory.\n\nThrough the panic, he searched the crowd for her. His shaking gaze swept across face after face, desperately seeking her presence. As always, he didn't find her.\n\n*'I'm sorry. I can't forgive myself for becoming dirtied in front of you. I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.'* Her final words haunted him—a testament he couldn't forget no matter how he tried.\n\nThey forced him onto the guillotine platform and shoved him to his knees. His vision blurred with tangled green hair.\n\n*'I love your hair. It's a beautiful green, like the forest. Agnus, do you know what you are to these children? You're their forest. Without you, they would have died alone long ago. I love your kindness. Without forests, neither humanity nor the world can exist—just as I can't exist without you.'*\n\nOne ordinary morning, Luna had told him this while he fed abandoned dogs. Why did he remember that day now? Agnus' eyes turned bloodshot, veins bulging in his neck.\n\n\"I...!\" His voice cracked. He barely managed to speak the truth no one would believe. \"I didn't kill them!\"\n\nIt was a cry meant for Luna—a prayer that she wouldn't be disappointed in him. His desperate shout reached not Luna, who no longer existed in this world, but something else entirely.\n\n**[The 1st Great Demon Baal is speaking with a smile.]**\n\n> *Get rid of your resentment.*\n\n**[Baal wants to give you a chance. The quest you rejected will be regenerated.]**\n\n**[Massacre (1)]**\n\n**[Difficulty: Class quest.**\n\n**1st Great Demon Baal wants human souls. Slaughter humans and give their souls to Baal.**\n\n**★ Quest Acceptance Reward: Freedom from all curses currently afflicting you.**\n\n**Quest Clear Conditions: Kill 1,000 players (0/1000)**\n\n**Quest Clear Reward: 200,000 demonic power. Quest linked to Massacre (2).]**\n\n**[Would you like to accept the quest?]**\n\nBefore answering, Agnus looked at the crowd again. Still laughing. Some reveled in his misfortune. Others mocked his claims of innocence. Many hadn't even been harmed by him—they were just *enjoying the show*. Something snapped in Agnus' mind. Uncontrollable rage surged through him as reason drowned in a dark, suffocating swamp.\n\n\"That's right! He didn't kill anyone!\"\n\nA blonde girl pushed through the crowd, her voice cutting through the noise. \"The Yatan Church framed him! I have a witness—the seven kingdoms should hear the evidence before proceeding with this execution!\"\n\nThe young woman presented a Yatan Church member as proof.\n\nEuphemina.\n\nAgnus' expression, twisted into something demonic moments before, went completely blank."
