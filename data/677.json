  "content": "\"You defeated Alex, just as I expected.\" Sticks beamed with pride. \"Truly remarkable.\"\n\nGrid shared his joy. Together, they'd overcome a monumental challenge—for Sticks especially, who had waited decades for a savior capable of purifying the Behen Archipelago. To him, Grid represented nothing less than salvation itself.\n\nYet even as they celebrated, Grid's elation began to curdle.\n\n\"Sticks...\" Grid's expression darkened. \"I understand now why you were so confident I could clear this place. Death Knight Alex couldn't use any of his original skills.\"\n\nSticks said nothing.\n\nDuring the great demon raid, Yura had demonstrated the full arsenal of the Demon Slayer class—diverse, devastating abilities specifically designed to suppress demonkin. Had Alex retained those powers, he could have shut down Grid's Blackening transformation entirely.\n\nInstead, today's fight had been limited to basic magic power explosions and crude melee strikes, relying solely on the transformative properties of that magic engineering bayonet. Come to think of it, Lantier had been the same. Grid had died too quickly then to notice, but looking back, the legendary assassin had used only stealth—none of the fearsome techniques he must have possessed in life.\n\n\"They've lost almost everything after becoming death knights, haven't they?\"\n\n\"Their base stats and level have plummeted,\" Sticks confirmed quietly. \"And yes, most of their skills are gone. The Alex who pushed you so hard today...\" He paused. \"He's perhaps a hundredth as strong as he was in life.\"\n\nGrid's fist clenched until his knuckles went white. His pride stung worse than any blade wound.\n\n*That's it. That's why Sticks was so sure I could do this. Not because I'm as strong as the legends of old—but because their death knights are pathetically weak.*\n\n\"You're right,\" Sticks continued, watching Grid's trembling frame. \"The legendary death knights here are shadows of what they once were. Weakened by death, and further diminished since Pagma vanished. Honestly? Calling them 'legendary' is almost an insult to the title.\" His voice softened. \"But that's precisely why I believed you could defeat them.\"\n\n\"...Ha.\" Grid could only exhale bitterly.\n\nHis excitement had evaporated. He'd wasted his Immortal passive on an enemy that barely deserved the legendary designation. An opponent he should have beaten *without* needing that trump card.\n\n*I can't keep doing this.*\n\nThe realization struck deep. First he'd relied on powerful items, earning him the nickname \"Overgeared.\" Now he was becoming dependent on immortality itself. \n\n*At this rate, I should be called the Immortal King instead.*\n\nGrid didn't even register that \"Immortal King\" actually sounded cooler than \"Overgeared King\"—a minor tragedy.\n\nHis thoughts drifted to the battle with Agnus. *Without Immortal that day, I would've lost.* And that wasn't the only time. Most of his victories in one-on-one combat stemmed not from superior skill, but from that five-second safety net.\n\nNobody would blame him for it. Immortal was a unique privilege of legendary classes—a tool meant to be used. Yet Grid couldn't shake the gnawing self-criticism.\n\n*This kind of thinking is poison.*\n\nThe real problem lay deeper than tactics. Somewhere in his subconscious, the thought \"I can't die because I'm immortal\" had taken root. The assumption that \"I can win because I have Immortal\" would inevitably become \"I *can't* win without it.\" If he didn't uproot this corrupted mindset now, he'd eventually face disaster.\n\nIt was a surprisingly mature self-assessment. Grid didn't realize how rare such introspection truly was. How many people could identify the rot in their own subconscious and resolve to excise it? Writers rationalized chain-smoking as essential to their craft for decades without quitting. In his quiet struggle toward self-improvement, Grid was already becoming exceptional—though he'd never recognize it himself.\n\n\"However—\"\n\nSticks' voice pulled Grid from his brooding. The sage's expression had shifted from somber to warm.\n\n\"While these death knights are diminished compared to their living selves, they remain specters of legends past. Very few among the current generation could defeat them.\" He met Grid's eyes meaningfully. \"Please don't misunderstand. I believed in you because I trusted your abilities—not because I dismissed the death knights. You are exceptional, Grid. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: take pride in that.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nPraise from a sage. The old Grid would've grinned ear to ear, scratching his head with that goofy smile. But Grid had changed. He wanted to climb higher. Satisfaction was the enemy of growth, and he couldn't afford complacency—not when his ambitions reached so far.\n\n\"I might be exceptional compared to ordinary people,\" Grid said quietly. \"But my opponents are monsters.\"\n\nGreat demons capable of driving humanity to extinction. Agnus, contracted with Baal himself. The continental superpower that was the Saharan Empire. Ares on its borders, building a rival kingdom. Sword Saint Kraugel, in a league of his own. The yangbans of the East Continent...\n\nAnd then there were the Overgeared members—precious companions, yes, but also competitors who'd overtake him the moment he slackened.\n\n*No.* \n\nGrid was determined to stand at the summit. For the first time in his life, he believed himself worthy of it. That confidence—hard-won and precious—was something he'd defend with everything he had.\n\nHe took a deep breath and rose to his feet, jaw set with determination.\n\n\"On the next island, I'll win without relying on Immortal.\"\n\n\"...!\" Sticks' eyes widened in alarm. The Immortal passive required at least a full day to recharge. \"Surely you're not planning to challenge the sixty-third island immediately?\"\n\n*Without your passive?* The old sage practically trembled at Grid's resolve.\n\n\"Am I crazy?\" Grid shot him a look. \"Obviously I'll challenge it tomorrow.\"\n\nHe'd said he wouldn't *rely* on Immortal—not that he'd fight without it.\n\n\"Why would I go in with it on cooldown?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nClassic Grid. Despite his grand declaration and lofty resolve, his practical nature remained intact. His pride could bend when reason demanded it. He had no interest in suffering pointless defeats for the sake of some abstract principle. It wasn't particularly noble to watch, but it was eminently sensible.\n\n*As expected of a king...*\n\nWithout warning, Grid pulled cloth from his inventory and began crafting underwear.\n\n***\n\nThe true joy of any game lay in its rewards. Grid loved the dopamine rush of checking newly crafted items and discovering he'd hit the jackpot. Yet despite defeating Alex, he still hadn't examined his loot.\n\nFear held him back.\n\n*The problem is that Death Knight Alex was too weak.*\n\nWhatever Alex had been in life, his death knight form had been disappointingly frail compared to true legends. Sure, among current players only Grid and Kraugel could have defeated him—he was still a powerful boss. But Sticks' commentary had warped Grid's perspective, making Alex seem like a pushover. \n\nAnd if the enemy was trash, wouldn't the drops be trash too?\n\nSo Grid had crafted four pieces of underwear without checking his rewards, unable to muster the courage to face potential disappointment.\n\nSticks couldn't take it anymore. \"Just look at the gun and gloves already. They're bound to be incredible equipment.\"\n\n\"Wait... one more piece of underwear.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*What is even the point of this?* Sticks couldn't fathom Grid's logic. But any gamer would understand perfectly.\n\n*If this underwear comes out rare-rated, then I'll check the items!*\n\nAll four previous pieces had been normal rating. Grid's underwear production skill was still low-level, sure, but he blamed his terrible luck more than anything else.\n\n*Intermediate skills can produce up to rare rating... If I get a rare one now, that means my luck has turned!*\n\nAnd if his luck was good right now, then checking the items in this moment might yield...\n\n*Higher ratings! Extra options!*\n\nLogically, it was nonsense. Pure superstition, no different from players who believed certain times or locations improved enhancement success rates. But humans clung to superstition, especially when dealing with RNG-based systems.\n\n[You have completed underwear production.]\n\n[Due to Intermediate Underwear Production Method, a rare-rated item has been created! Very low chance for additional options!]\n\n*Ttiring~*\n\n**[Clean Underwear]**\nRating: Rare  \nDurability: None | Defense: 5  \n* Agility +1\n\n*Unremarkable but exceptionally comfortable underwear. Facilitates easy movement.*\n\nWeight: 1\n\n*When rare-rated items are produced, all stats permanently increase by +2 and reputation rises by +30.*\n\nGrid had suffered harsh penalties to his blacksmith benefits after producing too many legendary items—rare and epic crafts no longer boosted his stats. But those penalties only applied to blacksmithing. His tailoring and underwear production skills were still intermediate level, meaning he still received the bonuses.\n\n\"Now!\"\n\nPure satisfaction flooded through him as his stats increased by two points across the board. Convinced his luck had finally turned, Grid shouted:\n\n\"Legendary! Blacksmith's! Appraisal!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nOne disadvantage of Pagma's Descendant was having to vocalize embarrassing skill names. Grid had long since stopped caring. Ever since he'd first bellowed \"Item Combination!\" his shame had died. Now the embarrassment belonged to whoever happened to be nearby—like Sticks, whose face had turned crimson.\n\n[Observing the target item through a legendary blacksmith's eyes.]\n\n[Hidden features will be revealed.]\n\n*Ttiring~*\n\n**[Alex's Quick Gloves (Produced by Pagma)]**\nRating: Legendary  \nDurability: 60/340 | Defense: 130  \n* Normal attack speed increased by **300%**\n\n*Gloves crafted by legendary blacksmith and Baal's Contractor, Pagma. Designed specifically to compensate for Death Knight Alex's greatest weakness—the guardian of the sixty-second island.*\n\nWeight: 66\n\n\"Two times?\"\n\nNo.\n\n\"Not double. *Triple?*\"\n\nGrid's heart hammered against his ribs."
