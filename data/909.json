  "content": "The Behen Archipelago operated on fundamentally different principles than traditional dungeons. Each entrant triggered the generation of their own unique instance—the archipelago's structure remained identical across copies, but progress remained isolated. Two players could theoretically stand in the same location yet exist in completely separate dimensions.\n\n[Code name 214098 has disappeared.]\n\nThe operations team stared at their monitors in silence.\n\nCode name 214098 had been born within the Behen Archipelago's forty-first island—a perfect replica of Grid's class, statistics, titles, equipment, and even his pets. By design, it should have remained trapped within that isolated dimension forever.\n\n[Code name 214098 has been destroyed and Player Grid will be rewarded.]\n\nBut the clone had died while Blackening consumed it, dragged itself to hell, and met its final end in the open world—not within the archipelago's confines.\n\n\"Wait...\" One team member leaned closer to his screen. \"Did we just watch him clear that fight without breaking a sweat?\"\n\nThe entire team had witnessed Grid systematically dismantle his doppelganger. He'd identified its nature, destroyed its armor piece by piece, and achieved victory with calculated precision. This was supposed to be a catastrophically difficult encounter.\n\n\"What happens to the reward?\" another employee asked. Nervous energy rippled through the office. \"He already received compensation when he killed the clone the first time. Will the system grant duplicate rewards?\"\n\n[Player Grid has cleared the 41st island.]\n\n[Player Grid has acquired one skill level point from the mission clear reward.]\n\n[Player Grid has acquired the skill 'Blacksmith's Eyes.']\n\n\"How is this even possible?\" The lead technician pulled up diagnostic screens. \"Did Morpheus classify code name 214098's location as still being within the Behen Archipelago? That's the only explanation for why it's granting island completion rewards.\"\n\n\"But Grid already received those rewards.\" Another employee's fingers flew across his keyboard, checking logs. \"This has to be a system error.\"\n\nA ripple of concern spread through the room. The moment an entity designed to exist solely within an instance dungeon breached into the open world, the entire system's stability had been compromised. Morpheus's reputation for infallibility was at stake.\n\n\"No.\" Chairman Lim Cheolho's voice cut through the growing panic as he entered the operations center. \"Morpheus is applying the 'user motivation' clause. This is intentional correction, not error.\"\n\nEvery head turned toward him.\n\nLim Cheolho approached the central display, where Grid's battered form filled the screen. \"Satisfy exists to fulfill dreams that reality renders impossible. Within this world, effort *must* yield proportional reward. It's the fundamental principle that separates us from the arbitrary cruelty of real life.\"\n\nHe gestured at the cascade of system messages still scrolling past Grid's vision. \"Every monster defeated grants appropriate compensation—that's the social contract. Grid succeeded in destroying an entity that possessed his own power, an entity with finite reward capacity. Logic demands he receives those rewards. The clone's death triggered the completion condition, regardless of where that death occurred.\"\n\nThe chairman's gaze softened as he studied the young man on screen—bloodied, exhausted, but standing. \"Remarkable. Even accounting for accidents and unintended consequences, his accomplishments rival those of the Hero King. Several times over, he's inadvertently saved humanity itself.\"\n\n*A hero falls from the heavens...*\n\nLim Cheolho allowed himself a slight smile. The East Continent awaited, with all its dangers. The yangbans of the Hwan Kingdom matured at rates that made even Grid's explosive growth seem pedestrian. Those immortal aristocrats had subjugated multiple kingdoms, reducing their royal families to puppets. They would test Grid in ways that Western Continent threats never could. They would force him to drain bitter cups to the dregs.\n\nYet Cheolho felt no concern. Grid's fundamental nature differentiated him from every other powerhouse in Satisfy's history. He grew stronger daily without sacrificing his humanity. The temptation that accompanied overwhelming power—the corruption that claimed so many—found no purchase in someone who treasured his family and companions above personal ambition.\n\n*You're more than you appear to be.* Did Grid understand his own significance?\n\nTeam Leader Yoon Nahee studied Lim Cheolho's expression—the almost paternal pride—with undisguised curiosity.\n\n[The compensation for Player Grid has been deemed insufficient. The compensation's contents are changed from Blacksmith's Eyes to 'Code Name 214098' Eyes.]\n\n\"What?!\" The unified exclamation echoed through the operations center.\n\nEven Chairman Lim Cheolho's composure cracked. The eyes of code name 214098—which meant Grid's clone's eyes—\n\n[The player needs to be given an intuitive sense of the skill. Changing the name 'Code Name 214098' Eyes to Eyes of Pagma-Baal's Contractor Version.]\n\nBaal's gift. The First Great Demon, whose artificial intelligence represented Satisfy's most sophisticated programming, had sent the clone to the surface purely for entertainment. In doing so, he'd granted it a power once bestowed upon Pagma himself—Pagma's Eyes, the legendary blacksmithing vision that transcended normal Item Appraisal.\n\n\"You predicted this.\" Yoon Nahee's words weren't quite a question.\n\n\"Claiming foresight would be insufferably arrogant.\" Lim Cheolho shook his head. \"Satisfy's complexity exceeds prediction. I can only respond to what emerges.\"\n\nYoon Nahee's brow furrowed. \"But is this acceptable? Pagma's Eyes ranks among the world's most powerful skills. Giving it to Grid at this stage—\"\n\n\"What exactly concerns you?\"\n\n\"The player gap.\" She pulled up comparative statistics. \"Kraugel completed the Seven Malignant Saints quest. He obtained Qualification of a Blood King and absorbed great demon power. Those achievements narrowed the distance between him and Grid considerably. But now Grid receives Pagma's Eyes, and the gap explodes again.\" Her fingers tapped through additional profiles. \"Agnus remains stuck on the Seven Malignant Saints quest with no apparent path forward. Haster, who should rival Grid, will fall decisively behind after this acquisition. We're creating a situation where no one can challenge him.\"\n\n\"The gap will close naturally.\" Kim Gun, the operations team's second-in-command, offered his perspective. \"Grid's growth curve is approaching its apex, while other top players haven't reached the intermediate stage. Time favors them.\"\n\nEventually Grid would plateau, and the pack would catch up. The logic seemed sound.\n\nYoon Nahee's expression remained skeptical. \"On what basis do you assume Grid's growth is near completion? Because he's cleared most class quests? Because he's collected the majority of Pagma's legacy items?\" She shook her head. \"As long as Grid continues creating new and more powerful equipment, his growth curve has no ceiling.\"\n\nEven if Kim Gun's theory held merit—\n\n\"The immediate problem is the Fourth National Competition. If Grid enters without peer opposition, at least three events become forgone conclusions. Viewer engagement will crater.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Kim Gun's face fell. \"Right.\"\n\n\"We can't restore balance through NPC intervention.\" Yoon Nahee's frustration leaked through. \"Games, novels, films—every narrative requires conflict. Overwhelmingly powerful protagonists must face setbacks for dramatic tension. But Grid is a *player.* We can't suppress someone who earned their strength through legitimate effort. The backlash would destroy us.\"\n\nSilence settled over the operations center as the team grappled with the impossible puzzle.\n\n\"The next National Competition.\" Lim Cheolho's voice cut through the tension. \"We'll introduce a new event—'Demon King Subjugation.' What if we invite Grid to serve as the adversary?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, what?\"\n\nThe suggestion was so unexpected that Yoon Nahee actually blinked.\n\nLim Cheolho's expression brightened with genuine enthusiasm. \"Piaro, Mercedes, Asmophel, the true blood vampire Noll... Grid commands subordinates worthy of demon generals, does he not?\"\n\n\"I... don't follow.\"\n\n\"We create a mission called 'Defeat the Demon King's Four Heavenly Kings.' On the National Competition server, Grid becomes the demon king. His subordinates serve as the four heavenly kings. Players must defeat them.\" The chairman's smile widened. \"And here's the crucial detail—we conceal their identities completely. The audience and participants shouldn't realize who they're fighting until the reveal. A surprise event.\"\n\n\"That's... creative,\" Yoon Nahee admitted slowly. \"But you're only considering the management perspective. Grid is a *player.* Why would he accept a role that earns him zero medals? The incentive structure doesn't work.\"\n\n\"Who says he can't win medals?\" Lim Cheolho's grin turned distinctly mischievous. \"Every victory by the demon king or his four heavenly kings awards Grid a medal.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Yoon Nahee found herself without counterargument.\n\nNeither she nor Kim Gun could refute the proposal. Not from fear of termination—the idea genuinely possessed merit. The competition's success hinged on compelling drama, and concealing Grid's identity added a delicious layer of mystery.\n\n\"If we alter the names and visual effects of Grid's signature skills, maintaining his anonymity becomes trivial. Well?\" The chairman looked expectantly between them. \"Doesn't it solve our problem elegantly?\"\n\nYoon Nahee and Kim Gun exchanged glances. Neither could deny the logic.\n\nGrid had indeed transcended normal player status—calling him a demon king among humans wasn't mere hyperbole. Of course, that distinction only applied within the player base.\n\n*Since the other Four Miracles besides Kraugel won't participate in the competition, this actually creates perfect balance.*\n\nLim Cheolho's smile reached his eyes. The Satisfy National Competition was about to evolve from players participating *in* the event to players *becoming* the event itself.\n\n***\n\n\"WAAAAAAAAH!\"\n\n\"God Grid! God Grid! God Grid!\"\n\nThe roar of the crowd echoed through Murray Kingdom's war-torn streets. Citizens and soldiers alike pressed forward, desperate to glimpse the man who'd single-handedly crushed an opponent that had terrorized high rankers. Grid stood amid the rubble, and his eyes—\n\nHis eyes had changed.\n\nOnce black as obsidian, his irises now contained depths of luminous blue, like staring into an ocean trench where light bent strange and beautiful.\n\n\"Ah... ahhh...!\"\n\n*Thud.* While Murray Kingdom's forces celebrated, Earl Lauel collapsed to his knees. Strength simply drained from his legs the moment he registered Grid's new gaze—those eyes that belonged in animation, not reality.\n\n\"I'm... so envious...\" His voice cracked.\n\nGrid ignored the weeping strategist and focused on the notification window hovering before him.\n\n> **[Eyes of Pagma-Baal's Contractor Version Lv. 1]**\n> \n> You can check and copy the stats, options and production method just by looking at the target item.\n> \n> However, in order to copy the item, you must use an item that you have created yourself. In addition, the difference in rating of the target item and the item used as the material must be within one grade. The item used as the material can't be recovered.\n> \n> * Skills that belong to the target item might not be copied.\n> \n> * The duration of the duplication is one day. The copied item that has reached the end of this duration will be permanently destroyed.\n> \n> **Skill Resource Consumption:** One item.\n> \n> **Skill Cooldown Time:** 1 hour.\n> \n> * Pagma's Eyes, which were able to check the information of the target item just by looking at it, evolved as soon as Pagma contracted with 1st Great Demon Baal.\n> \n> Under the contract, Baal could intervene with Pagma's soul and give Pagma more power. This power was later transmitted to Pagma's Descendant.\n\nGrid stood motionless, processing the implications.\n\nHe'd entered this fight hoping to secure pavranium from the God Hands his clone wielded. The God Hands hadn't dropped. The pavranium remained beyond reach.\n\nInstead, he'd received something infinitely more valuable.\n\n*Ba-dump. Ba-dump.*\n\nHis heart hammered against his ribs as the skill's versatility crystallized in his mind. The possibilities sprawled before him like an unexplored continent.\n\n\"Eyes... I want eyes too...\" Lauel huddled in the corner like a child denied dessert, tears streaming down his face."
