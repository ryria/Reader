  "content": "*Does he go through this hell every single time?*\n\nPanmir watched Grid hammer the glowing bead, his thoughts churning. Most blacksmiths—himself included—simply gathered materials and clicked the Production Button. Even that monotonous process wore on them. Sitting still for hours while the system worked was tedious enough.\n\nAnd it only took a few hours at most. Panmir rarely spent more than three days on anything, even when crafting ego items that required precise conditions.\n\nGrid had been at this for *six days straight.*\n\nSix days of designing, calculating, adjusting for variables, and repeating the same motions thousands of times. The skill was one thing—anyone could learn that. But the sheer mental fortitude required? That was something else entirely.\n\n*If I'd gotten the Legendary Blacksmith class instead... could I have done what he's done?*\n\nThe answer came immediately.\n\n*Not a chance.*\n\nShame twisted in Panmir's gut. He'd envied Grid once. Hell, he knew plenty of blacksmiths who still did—players who assumed the legendary class made everything easy. If they could see this...\n\nThere'd be nothing left to envy.\n\n***\n\n**TTANG!**\n\nThe hammer fell for the ten-thousandth time.\n\n>**[The White Tiger's Breath has been strengthened!]**\n\n\"Yes!\" Grid's shout cracked with exhaustion and triumph.\n\nPanmir jerked upright from where he'd been dozing. Kraugel's head snapped around, relief flooding his expression after a week of standing guard. On the anvil, the White Tiger's Breath had transformed completely—a perfect transparent sphere that seemed to pulse with inner light.\n\n><span class=\"item-epic\">**[Strengthened White Tiger's Breath]**\nThe White Tiger's Breath, hardened through countless impacts.\n* Increases earth resistance by 40% even when carried in inventory\n* Can be infused into items to grant the white tiger's powerful aura\n* Can only be attached to items with strong earth attributes\n**Weight:** 2</span>\n\n\"Finally!\" Grid wiped sweat from his forehead. \"Now I can make the actual sword.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nKraugel blinked. The *sword*. Right. After watching Grid pound that bead for a week, he'd completely forgotten what they were making in the first place.\n\nBeside him, Euphemina and Panmir exchanged glances. All three shared the same thought: *How much harder is he about to work?*\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" Kraugel bowed his head.\n\nGrid froze, confused. \"What? Why are you apologizing?\"\n\n\"I didn't realize... I never imagined making items put you through this much suffering. Asking you to craft this sword—I've placed an enormous burden on you.\"\n\n\"No, that's not—\"\n\n\"You suffered like this when you made my orb too,\" Euphemina cut in, her voice soft with admiration. \"Grid, you're incredible. To sacrifice so much for the sake of creating the best items... everyone should learn from your example.\"\n\n\"Wait, no—\"\n\n\"You should be featured on National Geographic,\" Panmir added earnestly. \"They need to make a documentary showing how much more effort and dedication you pour into this than any real-world craftsman.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" Euphemina nodded vigorously. \"Everyone should know Grid is the hardest worker in the world!\"\n\n\"Grid, so many people would respect you if they knew.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe world's hardest worker. Worthy of respect. Three of the world's top players in their respective fields were praising his incredible work ethic with completely straight faces.\n\nGrid felt absolutely miserable.\n\n*Is it really just me who has to live like this?*\n\nHow many people suffered in a *game*? Games were supposed to be fun. Satisfying. Pleasurable. He was definitely a special case—and not in a good way.\n\nSighing, Grid pulled out Muksabal's design. \"Let's get started.\"\n\n***\n\nKraugel, Euphemina, and Panmir stood side by side, barely breathing as they watched.\n\nGrid's concentration never wavered. Every movement was precise, deliberate, brilliant in its efficiency.\n\n**Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!**\n\nUnder the hammer, hell's finest mineral transformed. The bloodstone turned transparent red—beautiful as stained glass yet harder than any known metal.\n\n**Hwaruruk!** Fire roared. The blade's shape began to emerge from the flames.\n\n**Chiiiik!** Steam hissed as Grid quenched the metal in water.\n\n**Ttang! Ttang!**\n\nAgain. And again. Dozens of repetitions, each one building on the last.\n\n\"Ohhh!\" \n\n\"Incredible...\"\n\nMore blacksmiths had crowded into the smithy when word spread that Grid was finishing. Now they gasped in unison.\n\nA transparent red sword with a crown-shaped knuckle guard rested on the anvil. Nothing about it was flashy or ostentatious, yet it radiated quiet elegance—like an heirloom passed down through generations of royalty.\n\n*Perfect.* Grid's heart thundered. The blade's thickness and width incorporated both his own knowledge and Kraugel's instincts as a Sword Saint. Every proportion was flawless.\n\n>**[You are witnessing a famous sword of the era!]**\n>**[You will gain an additional bonus if you acquire this sword!]**\n\n**Thump.**\n\nKraugel's pulse quickened. He'd seen that notification once before—when he first encountered Grid's Enlightenment Sword at the Third National Competition. In that moment, the truth crystallized:\n\nMeeting Grid had been the greatest stroke of luck in his life.\n\n*I'll repay this debt a hundred times over.*\n\nSomehow, Grid seemed to sense his determination. Confidence surged through him.\n\n\"This is it!\" Grid's voice rang with excitement as he reached for the strengthened White Tiger's Breath. \"The final step!\"\n\n**FLASH!**\n\nBrilliant white light exploded through the smithy—warm and blinding in equal measure.\n\n\"**AHHHHH!**\"\n\nWhen the light faded, two completed swords lay on the anvil. The transparent red blade had become white as fresh snow, gleaming like captured starlight.\n\n><span class=\"item-myth\">**[World Crushing Sword of the Noble White Tiger]**\n**Rating:** Myth  \n**Durability:** 2,170/2,170  \n**Attack Power:** 3,150  \n**Defense:** 724\n\n* Physical attack power +20%\n* Defense +10%\n* Magic resistance +10%\n* Maximum health +20%\n* Earth attribute damage +30%\n* Dark attribute damage +15%\n* Additional damage to sacred beings +20%\n* Chance to increase sword weight when attacking. Physical attack power that ignores defense increases by 113%, but sword recovery speed is delayed by one second.\n* Normal chance to trigger **'Pillar'** when attacked. Creates a giant stone pillar with a 5-meter blast radius. Damage dealt is 50% of weapon's attack power.\n* Normal chance to block attacks. Successful blocks trigger **'Thorns'**—sharp stone thorns that damage all targets in range and inflict **'Reduced Recovery.'** Damage dealt is 30% of weapon's attack power.\n★ Low chance to inflict **'Partial Petrification'** when attacking. Ignores petrification resistance. Restores a small amount of health when attacking petrified targets.\n* Generates the skill **'White Tiger's Attitude'**\n* Generates the skill **'White Tiger's Cry'**\n\n*A sword destined to become myth beyond legend. Its wielder will achieve countless victories and become the protagonist of hymns sung by future generations.*\n\n*Crafted through Grid's Seeing the Gods' Techniques, Mumud's magic, and a Sword Saint's knowledge. The White Tiger's Breath has been pushed to its absolute limits, unlocking the hidden functions of 'petrification' and 'recovery.'*\n\n*To enemies, a symbol of terror. To its master, a symbol of protection.*\n\n**Conditions of Use:** Top three rankers in each class capable of wielding swords  \n**Weight:** 6,800</span>\n\n><span class=\"skill\">**[White Tiger's Attitude Lv. 1]**  \nAssumes the White Tiger's defensive stance.  \nAttack power and movement speed -80%  \nDefense +198%  \n**Skill Mana Cost:** 17 per second  \n**Cooldown Time:** 30 minutes</span>\n\n><span class=\"skill\">**[White Tiger's Cry Lv. 1]**  \nCreates an earthquake within a 5-meter radius.  \nAll targets suffer **'Loss of Balance'** status and -13% to defense, evasion, and accuracy. Forcibly cancels any active spells or skills.  \n**Mana Cost:** 1,500  \n**Cooldown Time:** 10 minutes</span>\n\n*It's perfect.*\n\nThe attack power was lower than his Enlightenment Sword, true. And when the black flames and red lightning activated, the Enlightenment Sword's destructive potential was unmatched.\n\nBut for sustainability and balance? The White Tiger Sword was superior in every way. Far more versatile.\n\nAnd White Tiger's Attitude... Grid's mind raced through the possibilities.\n\n*An eighty percent reduction to attack power.* With his already overwhelming offensive stats, he could still crush most opponents even at twenty percent. But who could break through defense that had *tripled*?\n\n*You'd need to be duke-level or higher.*\n\nThe skill was absurdly powerful for anyone with exceptional base stats. For someone like Grid, it was borderline fraudulent.\n\n>**[You have produced three myth-rated items! Something special will occur!]**\n\nGrid grinned at the notification and turned to Kraugel, holding out a second sword—a normal-rated, growth-type White Tiger Sword."
