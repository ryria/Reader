  "content": "# Chapter 186\n\n**Breaking News:** Thousands of users continue searching for the path to Hell, hoping to obtain a memphis—the demonic beast now famous as Grid's pet, Noe. Recent reports confirm that the supposed entrance in the Astra Mountains was a hoax, spread by user bandits to lure victims. Authorities warn travelers to avoid the region.\n\n**Urgent Update:** A map to the legendary Siren Kingdom has surfaced on the black market. Adventurers from across the continent are mobilizing. Speculation runs rampant about who discovered the hidden nation first...\n\nYoungwoo kept the radio on during his drive. Not from interest, exactly. *Information is power.* He'd learned that lesson the hard way.\n\n\"First discoverer of the Siren Kingdom.\" He gripped the steering wheel tighter. \"Titles, money, reputation. They'll get it all.\"\n\n*Whoever they are, I hate them.*\n\nYoungwoo took a long breath, forcing his shoulders to relax. The last thing he needed was another stress-induced hair loss incident.\n\n*Stay calm. Just stay calm.*\n\nHe pulled his 13 Series into the driveway. Two weeks ago, this street had been chaos—reporters, fans, gawkers. The neighbors had locked that down fast. Now his family could breathe again.\n\n\"I'm home.\"\n\n\"Welcome back.\" His mother met him at the door, and Youngwoo blinked. She looked different. Younger. The lines of worry that had etched themselves around her eyes over the past few years had smoothed away. These days, she walked through the neighborhood with her head high. *Youngwoo's mother.* That title opened doors.\n\nShe ushered him toward the kitchen. \"How was the filming? Wash up first, then eat. I roasted croaker.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nEverything had changed. Six months ago, basic tasks like washing his hands or sitting down for a meal felt like climbing mountains. Now he jogged with Sehee every morning.\n\n\"Brother, did you really only sleep four hours?\" Sehee emerged from her room, textbooks still in hand. She kept her expression neutral, but Youngwoo caught the concern underneath. His sister worried—about his health, about the tax situation, about whether he'd burn out before he turned thirty.\n\nYoungwoo scooped rice into his mouth. \"I'll get more sleep from now on. Taking a break from broadcasting for a while. Let's keep up the morning jogs, starting tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I thought you hated exercise.\"\n\n\"I do. But I need to take care of myself.\"\n\n\"Smart thinking.\" Their father set down his chopsticks. \"Health comes before money.\"\n\nThe old man had always been strict, pushing Youngwoo to grow up faster, be better. These days, though, his tone had softened into something approaching respect.\n\n\"You've already succeeded, Youngwoo. At twenty-eight, you've built tremendous wealth and earned worldwide recognition. You paid off my debts. That's enough. Don't sacrifice your health chasing more.\"\n\nEnough.\n\n*Ten billion won* in assets. Global fame. Most athletes never saw this kind of money in their twenties. Youngwoo's father had simple ambitions, simple needs. He assumed his son felt the same way.\n\nBut Youngwoo wasn't satisfied. Not even close.\n\n*Sorry, Dad. More money is always better.*\n\nHe remembered last year with perfect clarity. No beef. Ever. Just radish soup and cheap pork. The soup too watery, the meat too dry. For years, Youngwoo had convinced himself that beef just didn't taste good in soup. That maybe his family had some weird rule against it.\n\nThen this year happened. Brisket boiled into rich, sweet broth. Premium pork that melted on the tongue. Short ribs that dissolved into umami heaven.\n\n*There was no rule. We were just broke.*\n\nThe difference between having money and having nothing revealed itself in exactly these small ways.\n\n*I'm making more, Father. Whether you like it or not.*\n\nHis father had spent decades believing in frugality over ambition. Youngwoo wouldn't say it out loud, but he was different. Greedier. He'd tasted wealth now. He wasn't going back to poverty, wasn't returning to that life of watery soup and empty pockets.\n\n*Huroi and Lauel are right. Time to take their advice.*\n\nDinner with his father had crystallized something. Youngwoo could see the path now, sharp and clear.\n\n*Become a lord.*\n\nTen days ago, Bairan Village had been elevated to city status. Grid's performance at the National Competition—alongside Jishuka, Pon, and Regas—had drawn thousands of new residents. Monthly tax revenue now hit 500,000 gold. Roughly 600 million won.\n\nEvery. Single. Month.\n\nOne territory, developed properly, could generate that kind of passive income. The temptation was irresistible.\n\n*I need my own estate.*\n\nRight now, Youngwoo was merely Irene's husband—Lady of Winston. But being a consort and being a lord carried vastly different weight. As Irene's spouse, he could influence policy. He couldn't directly manage the taxes, couldn't truly control the territory's future. Youngwoo wanted ownership. True power.\n\n\"Brother?\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\nSehee stood in the hallway, one hand on her doorframe. She opened her mouth, closed it. Whatever she wanted to say, it died unspoken.\n\n\"...Good night.\"\n\n\"Night.\"\n\nShe retreated to her room. Youngwoo noticed the hesitation, filed it away for later. His mind was already racing ahead to Satisfy, to plans and possibilities.\n\nHe climbed into his capsule.\n\n\"Finally.\"\n\nBut first, a ritual.\n\n*Click.*\n\nYoungwoo pulled up his browser and navigated to Grid's Fan Cafe. One of 1.36 million members. Anonymous, just another face in the crowd. He did this every single day.\n\n**[Post Title: Grid-nim Looks So Cool!]**\n\n*The more I see him, the more handsome he gets! ^^ ~ There were rumors about him being bald, but that's obviously fake news ^^ㅎㅎ*\n\n\"Perfect.\"\n\nHe'd worn a partial hairpiece during the worst of his hair loss. Some trolls online claimed he looked strange on camera, started spreading baldness theories. This post would help counter the narrative.\n\nNext, he joined Noe's fan club.\n\n*Five hundred thousand more members than mine.*\n\nYoungwoo's eye twitched.\n\n*A cat is more popular than me. A cat.*\n\nHis pride stung every time he checked those numbers. Time for the second ritual.\n\n**[Post Title: Noe Is Ugly ㅋ]**\n\n*Standing next to Grid just makes Noe look worse. That cat is way too arrogant.*\n\n\"There. Much better.\"\n\nYoungwoo smiled at his own petty slander. Satisfied, he initiated the login sequence.\n\n***\n\n\"Dear husband~\"\n\nWinston Castle materialized around him. A small figure launched into Grid's arms the instant he opened his eyes. The familiar warmth, the familiar scent. Grid's smile came easily now.\n\n\"Have you been waiting long, Irene?\"\n\nGrid's personality shifted like changing masks. Shin Youngwoo or Grid. Blacksmith or swordsman. He'd been living this fractured existence for so long that the transitions happened without conscious thought. The acting had become nature.\n\n\"Am I really that good?\" Grid's tone softened, gentled. He gazed down at her with warm eyes.\n\n\"There's no one better in this world.\"\n\n\"Irene...\"\n\n\"Dear husband...\"\n\nThey'd been intimate eight times now. Grid's stamina and dexterity translated into very specific advantages, which naturally earned devotion.\n\n\"I want every day to be like yesterday.\"\n\n\"Haha...\" Grid's laugh came out awkward. He changed the subject. \"Where are my knights?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. Everyone seems busy today.\"\n\nGrid commanded three knights total. Jude, an NPC. Huroi and Lauel, users. The first dual-class user and the strongest of the Ten Rookies had both sworn fealty. The system required minimum monthly payments of 500 gold each, but the investment paid for itself.\n\nThe master-servant bond opened powerful options.\n\n\"Summon Knights.\"\n\n> [Which knight would you like to summon?]\n\n\"Huroi and Lauel.\"\n\n> [The summoning command has been sent. The response is pending.]\n\n> [The targets have accepted the summons.]\n\n> [The knights Huroi and Lauel have been summoned.]\n\nDistance meant nothing. Once a knight accepted the call, they appeared at their master's side regardless of location. Some areas blocked the skill, and the silence debuff could interfere, but Grid's resistance to silence made him effectively immune. He could summon his knights anywhere, anytime.\n\n\"You called, my Lord.\"\n\nHuroi's loyalty had evolved beyond role-play. He'd fully embraced the persona, speaking like a character from a historical drama.\n\n\"You logged in late today.\"\n\nLauel maintained similar devotion, though his style differed. Less flowery language, more pragmatic respect. He bowed after the summoning completed. Grid studied his two subordinates with satisfaction.\n\n\"Rise. Good to see you both.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nIrene's expression flickered with something unreadable. She mumbled an excuse about urgent business and slipped out. The office door clicked shut, leaving three men alone.\n\nLauel broke the silence first. \"You could have just sent a whisper. Why waste the summoning? The cooldown is thirty-six hours. What if you need us during an emergency?\"\n\nGrid was unique to Lauel—the only person capable of producing the items Lauel needed. Still, Grid waved off the concern.\n\n\"It's not that serious.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Complete carelessness.* The National Competition victories had inflated Grid's confidence to dangerous levels. Eventually, that arrogance would bite back.\n\n*But I'll protect him until then,* Lauel thought. His mind wandered to the weapon Grid would eventually craft for him.\n\n\"So why did you summon us?\"\n\nHuroi had been three hours away by drake, in the middle of a monster-hunting sub-quest. He wanted to believe this interruption mattered.\n\nGrid met their eyes.\n\n\"I'm going to become a lord.\"\n\n*Finally.*\n\nOne month in reality. Three months in Satisfy. Since the National Competition ended, Grid had focused on production—crafting items for the Tzedakah Guild, accumulating wealth and skill levels. Playing the role of guild blacksmith. Grid seemed content with this arrangement, overjoyed each time he unlocked a new production method.\n\nBut Huroi and Lauel saw it as tragic waste.\n\nThis unique existence, this legendary class user, satisfied with being a blacksmith for a small guild. No larger ambitions. No grand vision.\n\nThey'd spent weeks trying to persuade him. *Break free from the Tzedakah Guild. Expand into the wider world.*\n\nGrid had agonized over the decision for days.\n\n\"I'm withdrawing from the Tzedakah Guild. I'll create my own force, build something unique. Based on your advice.\"\n\nThe announcement sent electricity through both men.\n\n*Lord will become the first user...*\n\n*...to achieve kingship.*\n\nTheir thoughts aligned perfectly. With Grid's power, couldn't they dream of continental conquest? Not Zibal, but Grid would become the first emperor. They had no doubts.\n\nRight now, Grid only aspired to lordship. A simple, modest goal. But Huroi and Lauel envisioned something higher. To reach that peak, they'd need resources.\n\n\"After establishing your new guild, invite the Tzedakah Guild.\"\n\nTalent was essential. The Tzedakah Guild possessed some of the strongest rankers on the continent—a force that had to be absorbed.\n\nLauel explained, \"The Tzedakah Guild is addicted to your items by now. They won't want to lose access. Several members, including Jishuka, have personal stakes in maintaining ties with you. They'll join. If you ask, they'll become your subordinates.\"\n\nLauel spoke with absolute certainty. He'd only followed Grid for a month, but already he couldn't imagine functioning without Grid's equipment. *I'm a slave to items.*\n\n***\n\n\"It's been a long time.\"\n\nA blonde woman drew stares as she entered Winston. Her username floated above her head.\n\n**Euphemina.**\n\nFirst epic class.
