  "content": "# Chapter 416\n\nStrength was absolute.\n\nThis was one of the undeniable truths of Satisfy. No strategy, no cunning, no number of players could overcome a sufficiently overwhelming gap in raw power.\n\nBoss raids illustrated the principle perfectly. A monster with millions of health points would eventually crumble under sustained assault from dozens of players dealing tens of thousands of damage. But flip the equation and give that boss the power to annihilate players in a single strike? The truth shattered. Numbers became irrelevant.\n\nGrid possessed that power. Thirty-seven players from the allied teams stood between him and victory.\n\nHe could kill them all.\n\n***\n\nThe scoreboard told a grim story for the allied nations. Despite Yura and Peak Sword's best efforts, South Korea's defense was crumbling under the weight of superior numbers. Every Korean player except those two had been eliminated.\n\nThe commentators prepared their eulogies. Viewers around the world leaned forward, anticipating Korea's inevitable collapse.\n\nGrid appeared on the battlefield.\n\n\"The protagonist arrives,\" someone muttered.\n\nHe'd just finished dismantling Bondre and Bubat. His timing was, as always, immaculate. The commentators opened their mouths to deliver the expected praise, the spectators ready to erupt in cheers.\n\nThen they saw what he was wearing.\n\n『 Grid's outfit is... unique. 』\n\n『 That's one way to describe it. 』\n\nBlack armor. Black cloak. Golden leggings. Golden helmet. Red gauntlets.\n\nEach piece, viewed in isolation, was beautifully crafted. The designs were intricate, the colors vibrant. But together? The combination assaulted the eyes. Black on black. Gold on gold. The red gauntlets clashed with everything. He looked like a clown performing in a variety show punishment segment.\n\n\"Does he own a mirror?\" someone in the crowd asked.\n\n\"My eight-year-old niece has better color coordination,\" another replied.\n\n\"I'd rather fight naked than wear that.\"\n\nLaughter rippled through the allied teams. The tension bled from their shoulders. Grid had already burned through most of his skills and mana fighting Bondre and Bubat. Thirty-seven against one? They could do this. The math was simple.\n\nThe math was wrong.\n\nGrid tore through them like a thresher through wheat. The allied players were mostly second advancement users. Their attacks sparked harmlessly off his armor. His counterattacks shattered their guards and pulverized their bodies.\n\nFor every blow they landed, Grid returned ten. The slaughter was methodical. Brutal. Efficient.\n\n*This is what happens when you rely on numbers over strength,* Grid thought, his blade finding another throat.\n\nThe allied teams had expected a battle. What they got was an execution.\n\n\"I said I'd demonstrate the strongest defense if the damage patch limited my offense,\" Grid announced to no one in particular.\n\nHe was lying. His defense was impenetrable. His offense was equally devastating. This was the nightmare scenario for every player who'd ever envied top-tier equipment. This was the dream made manifest for every player who'd ever fantasized about being truly overgeared.\n\n『 Incredible! Simply incredible! 』\n\nThe commentator's voice cracked with excitement.\n\n『 At this point, Grid could probably handle two third advancement classes simultaneously. 』\n\n『 The allied teams are annihilated! Every single one! 』\n\n***\n\nZibal sat on the ground, still recovering from the vicious beating Pon had delivered. His eyes were bloodshot as he stared at the scoreboard.\n\n**1st. South Korea: 83 points.**  \n**2nd. United States: 68 points.**  \n**3rd. Russia: 47 points.**  \n**4th. Canada: 36 points.**\n\nHis jaw clenched hard enough that his teeth ground together.\n\n*Useless. Every single one of them.*\n\nThe allied teams had failed to stop South Korea. Failed to even slow them down. Now Korea could focus entirely on target processing. The gap would only widen.\n\nLauel approached, reading the situation with his usual clinical precision.\n\n\"I was hoping their interference would buy us time to catch up,\" Lauel said. \"Now that Korea can concentrate on scoring, we'll be fighting just to keep second place.\"\n\n\"What if we attack them directly?\" Zibal's voice was rough.\n\n\"We could try. Korea's exhausted, and everyone on our team is strong.\" Lauel paused, his smile sharpening. \"Except for you.\"\n\nThe emphasis was deliberate. Zibal's scowl deepened.\n\n\"But I can't estimate how long it would take to bring Grid down,\" Lauel continued. \"His defense is at least **3,100**, maybe higher. He seems to have some passive that grants extreme physical damage resistance.\"\n\nZibal's frown deepened. Third advancement tankers averaged **2,500** defense. Grid, a blacksmith, exceeded **3,000** without any defensive class passives.\n\n*Goddamn items.*\n\nZibal's own equipment came from Panmir, the world's top-ranked blacksmith. It was the only reason Pon's Rail Spear hadn't killed him outright. But compared to Grid's arsenal, it felt inadequate. Shameful.\n\n\"Attacking Korea means giving Russia and Canada an opening,\" Lauel said. He was handling targets while observing the Russian team's position on the lower mountain. \"Better to secure second place than gamble for first and end up with nothing.\"\n\nLauel's gaze drifted to the Russian team. Six players, no Kraugel, yet they were maintaining impressive efficiency while simultaneously fending off Italy's harassment.\n\n*Those four third advancement rankers are better than their reputations suggested. Is Kraugel's presence raising their morale even in absence?*\n\n> [System Notice: Sofia has been logged out! Team Hungary eliminated!]\n\n\"Monster,\" Lauel whispered.\n\nKraugel had crossed forests and mountains to assassinate high-value ranged targets. His kill count defied logic. The precision, the speed, the damage output. It was inhuman.\n\n*Could even Grid survive that assault?*\n\nThe thought troubled Lauel. Then another realization struck him.\n\n*Wait.*\n\nKraugel was the most active player on the battlefield. The most kills, the most interference. Was he aiming for the gold medal? Lauel had underestimated Russia's ambition.\n\n*Which means his next target would be...*\n\nYura. South Korea's highest-scoring remaining player.\n\n*The clash between Grid and Kraugel. Here. Now. In the opening event.*\n\nBefore he was Lauel of Overgeared, before he was Lauel representing the United States, he was a player of Satisfy. The prospect of witnessing that confrontation ignited something primal in him.\n\nHe wasn't alone. Hundreds of millions of viewers held the same hope.\n\n***\n\nThe lowest of Tira's three mountains hosted a different kind of battle.\n\nChina and Japan faced each other, both teams considering themselves Asia's true representatives. Target processing had become secondary to mutual sabotage. National pride superseded points.\n\nThree players remained detached from the nationalistic fervor.\n\nDamian watched Grid's performance on his display, eyes shining with admiration.\n\n\"Truly magnificent,\" the pope murmured.\n\nKatz yawned without bothering to cover his mouth.\n\n\"How boring,\" the Blood Warrior drawled.\n\nHao, the draconian, stared toward where Kraugel was hunting.\n\n\"The sky above the sky...\" His voice was barely audible.\n\nYoshimura, once considered a top Japanese ranker, looked between his teammates uncertainly.\n\n\"So... what's our play here?\"\n\nKatz stepped forward, a predatory smile crossing his face.\n\n\"Might as well kill these uncivilized pigs. Better than standing idle.\"\n\nThe Chinese rankers' faces flushed crimson.\n\n\"Uncivilized? You arrogant little shit!\"\n\n\"I'll rip your throat out!\"\n\n\"Die!\"\n\nThe Chinese team surged forward as one, hot-blooded and furious. Katz's provocation had worked perfectly.\n\nHe laughed and drew his blade. The Blood Warrior's true power emerged. Each strike siphoned enemy health. Blood pooled and then erupted in wide-area attacks. The Chinese players realized their mistake within seconds.\n\nHao finally moved, recognizing Katz's genuine strength.\n\nThe conflict escalated. Tensions between the Chinese mainland and Japanese islands exploded into violence on Tira's slopes.\n\nDamian's voice cut through the chaos.\n\n\"Korea will win anyway.\"\n\nEvery player froze for half a heartbeat.\n\nThe theory that Damian was secretly Korean gained more traction.\n\n***\n\nTarma tracked Kraugel through the terrain with practiced stealth.\n\n*Ten billion won on his head.*\n\nThe dark gamer belonged to Blood Carnival, a group that engaged in every profitable crime Satisfy offered. He'd joined Greece's national team for one purpose. Assassinate Kraugel. He'd entered every event the number one ranker participated in. He'd strike at Kraugel's neck repeatedly. The gold medal was irrelevant.\n\n*Kill him three times in PvP and I'll earn bonuses. Kill other famous rankers for additional payouts. I'll make hundreds of millions of won and migrate to America.*\n\nMansions. Beautiful women. Luxury. The future was bright.\n\nA flash of gold interrupted his fantasy.\n\nOne of Grid's <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">God Hands</span> hovered nearby, wielding a sword and methodically destroying targets. It seemed oblivious to its surroundings.\n\n*Annoying.*\n\nTarma worried the floating hand would draw Kraugel's attention and compromise his position. He struck it with his dagger.\n\nThe metallic clang was louder than expected. The hand didn't budge.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe'd hit it hard enough to send it flying. Instead, it had absorbed the impact completely.\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nTarma struck again. And again. And again.\n\nThe other <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">God Hands</span> stopped their target processing. As one, they turned toward Tarma. Recognition protocols activated.\n\nHostile entity detected.\n\n\"Shit.\"\n\nThey moved with purpose now, converging on his position. Autonomous movement was impressive enough. Autonomous decision-making was something else entirely.\n\n*No wonder Grid's items are famous,* Tarma thought, genuinely impressed despite his situation.\n\nA voice interrupted his assessment.\n\n\"What are you doing, attacking someone else's property?\"\n\nTarma spun.\n\nGrid stood behind him, arms crossed.\n\nThe assassin snorted.\n\n\"Grid? You're the one who has to worry. I'm here for Kraugel's head.\"\n\n---\n\n**[TL Note: Current release schedule is 20 chapters per week. Check the Patreon for early access to unedited chapters.]**"
