  "content": "# Chapter: A Meal, A Discovery, and an Envoy\n\nHao broke into a cold sweat as they stopped in front of the restaurant. A crimson signboard hung above the entrance, two golden dragons embossed on either side of the establishment's name: *Yongsungkak*.\n\n*He wasn't joking.*\n\nThe atmosphere was unmistakably Chinese—from the décor to the scent of oil and spices wafting through the doorway. Hao stared at the signboard in disbelief.\n\n*A Chinese person comes to South Korea and gets taken to a Chinese restaurant?*\n\nHad this been anyone else, Hao would have questioned their sanity. But this was Shin Youngwoo. Grid, the Overgeared King. The first among two billion users to claim a throne.\n\n*He must have some deeper reason for bringing me here.*\n\n\"My recommendation's the stone bowl jjampong.\" Youngwoo handed him the menu with the casual air of someone who came here often. \"Fair warning though—it's usually too spicy for foreigners. You might want to go with the jajangmyeon instead.\"\n\nYoungwoo normally ordered delivery from this place, but the stone bowl dishes were always too hot to transport properly. Having Hao as an excuse to dine in was perfect—he could finally enjoy his jjampong the way it was meant to be eaten. No grand strategy. Just an opportunity to satisfy a craving.\n\n\"I'm from Sichuan.\" Hao's tone carried a note of pride. \"Jjampong is seafood soup with chili oil and red pepper powder, correct? I can handle spicy food.\"\n\nThe people of Sichuan took their spice tolerance seriously—arguably more so than Koreans themselves. Reassured, Youngwoo nodded and placed their order.\n\n\"I'll have jajangmyeon.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Toon, you're getting jajang?\"\n\n\"...Yes.\"\n\nTwo jjampong, one jajangmyeon. The restaurant threw in sweet and sour pork as a complimentary side.\n\nWhen the golden-fried pieces arrived first, Hao took a single bite and immediately dismissed it.\n\n*Just as I expected. Cheap imitation.* The sauce was too acidic, the meat lacking proper texture. *No chewiness at all.*\n\nHao considered himself a connoisseur. He sampled fifty different dishes weekly. This Korean take on sweet and sour pork fell woefully short of his refined palate.\n\n\"Service!\" The employee set down a plate of fried dumplings with a smile.\n\nHao had already abandoned his chopsticks. After the disappointing pork, he had no interest in more subpar food. Better to wait for the jjampong Youngwoo had recommended.\n\nYoungwoo, meanwhile, continued attacking the sweet and sour pork with single-minded focus. Toon reached for the dumplings.\n\nThe moment Toon bit into one, the dumpling split apart with a crisp crack.\n\n*What—*\n\nThe aroma hit Hao like a physical force. Peppery heat bloomed through the air, cutting through the restaurant's ambient smells and seizing his attention. His appetite stirred involuntarily.\n\n*Wait... could they actually be good?*\n\nCuriosity won. Hao picked up his chopsticks and tried one.\n\nHis eyes widened.\n\n*It's just vegetables and meat. Basic ingredients. So why—* The rich pepper flavor rolled across his tongue, each note perfectly balanced, building rather than overwhelming. *Why is this so good?*\n\nBefore he realized it, he was reaching for another. Then another. His chopsticks moved with increasing speed, snatching dumplings faster than Toon could claim them.\n\nYoungwoo observed this performance with something approaching pity.\n\n*Poor guy. His usual diet must be terrible if he's this excited about frozen dumplings.*\n\nYongsungkak, like most neighborhood Chinese restaurants, used factory-made frozen dumplings. Cheap, mass-produced, requiring nothing more than a quick bath in hot oil. Yet Hao devoured them like they were haute cuisine.\n\nFinally, the main event arrived. The stone bowl jjampong simmered like molten lava, waves of heat rising from its crimson surface.\n\n\"Fair warning—this is genuinely spicy.\" Youngwoo gestured at the bowl with his chopsticks. \"Much hotter than the Sichuan-style jjampong you'd find at most Chinese restaurants.\"\n\nStandard jjampong was already spicy. Stone bowl jjampong took it to another level entirely.\n\nHao waved off the concern. \"I'm from Sichuan. Korean food doesn't intimidate me.\"\n\nHe'd show them what a proper Sichuan palate could handle. Chopsticks ready, he plunged into the dish, capturing noodles along with a tangle of seafood and vegetables.\n\n*SPICY!*\n\nHis face flushed crimson.\n\nWhat Hao didn't know—couldn't have known—was that the red powder liberally coating this particular jjampong wasn't traditional red pepper. The chef had loaded it with pure capsaicin extract, several magnitudes more intense than the Sichuan peppercorns he was accustomed to. His tongue burned. His eyes watered.\n\nYet his chopsticks never stopped moving.\n\n*I can't—I shouldn't—*\n\nBut every bite exploded with such depth of flavor, such perfectly orchestrated complexity, that stopping felt impossible. Each mouthful opened new dimensions of taste.\n\n*This isn't Chinese food. Not the way I know it.* None of the regional cuisines he'd sampled throughout his life tasted anything like this. *It's Korean-style. Like the dumplings. Everything here is so... robust. The chef's intuition is extraordinary.*\n\nSimple chicken broth and seafood shouldn't produce this richness. The Korean Chinese chefs clearly possessed secrets, techniques to amplify flavors to their absolute peak.\n\nHao, who'd spent years sampling only the finest Chinese cuisine, had become completely addicted to the MSG-laden offerings of a modest South Korean neighborhood restaurant.\n\n---\n\nSatisfy was more than a game. The name itself embodied the S.A. Group's vision—the first company to achieve perfect virtual reality. They never intended for it to remain trapped in the narrow confines of the word \"game.\" Many users had embraced it as a genuine second reality.\n\nAgnus numbered among them. For him, no distinction existed between Satisfy and the real world. More than that—he *needed* Satisfy to be real.\n\n*Satisfy's technology combined with the Baal's Contractor abilities... they'll be able to bring her back. They have to.*\n\n\"Keke... still too difficult?\"\n\nThe 62nd island of the Behen Archipelago. Here lurked something that transcended even the legendary Lantier from the previous island. Despair threatened to crush Agnus as he stared at yet another failure screen.\n\nDespite channeling every scrap of power his contract with the 1st Great Demon Baal provided, he couldn't break through.\n\n*Clack... clack clack.*\n\nMumud the lich gazed upward, hollow eye sockets somehow conveying longing. As though yearning for freedom beyond his undead existence.\n\nAgnus drove his boot into the fallen lich's ribcage, then turned to address the cowering fairy.\n\n\"Next time will be different.\" His voice carried absolute conviction. \"I'll conquer the entire Behen Archipelago and claim Pagma's legacy. All of it.\"\n\n\"H-hik! U-understood! Please, just spare me!\"\n\nAgnus' golden eyes burned with nothing but rage.\n\nBini, convinced she was moments from death, begged for mercy. Agnus laughed at the pathetic display and left the archipelago behind.\n\nHe couldn't imagine anyone conquering it before him.\n\n---\n\n> **[Underwear Production Method Lv. 1]**  \n> You can create underwear from various cloth and leather materials.  \n> Certain probability of producing Rare-rated underwear.  \n> Low probability of producing Rare-rated underwear with options.  \n>   \n> *When Rare-rated underwear is produced: All stats permanently +2, Continental reputation +30.*\n\n> **[Intermediate Tailoring Technique Lv. 8]**  \n> You can craft equipment items from various fabrics and leather materials.  \n> Rare probability of producing Rare~Epic rated items.  \n> Very rare probability of producing Unique-rated items.  \n>   \n> *When Rare-rated items are produced: All stats permanently +2, Continental reputation +30.*  \n> *When Epic-rated items are produced: All stats permanently +4, Continental reputation +80.*  \n> *When Unique-rated items are produced: All stats permanently +12, Continental reputation +300.*\n\n\"Holy—\"\n\nGrid stared at the notifications, heart racing.\n\nYears had passed since he'd become Pagma's Descendant. His blacksmithing skill had grown to such heights that he no longer received the stat-synergy bonuses from creating high-rated items—the game considered him too advanced to benefit from those incremental gains.\n\nBut tailoring was different. His newly acquired tailoring skill sat at intermediate level. The penalty didn't apply. Every high-rated item would grant full stat bonuses.\n\nAnd more than that—\n\n\"A production button!\"\n\nThree new options had appeared in his interface: underwear production, cloth items production, leather items production. Each carried a 120-minute cooldown. One click, one automatic creation. Every two hours, he could generate items without lifting a finger.\n\n\"I can't believe such a convenient feature exists...!\"\n\nTrue, it didn't extend to blacksmithing. But Grid could hardly complain. This would accelerate his skill progression beyond anything he'd imagined.\n\n\"This is incredible. An actual production button?\"\n\nCreating items with a single click? He'd never even considered such luxury.\n\n*Wait... the S.A. Group isn't usually this generous. Unless—* His stomach dropped. *Was this a bug?*\n\nGrid remained blissfully unaware that this \"revolutionary\" feature had been available to every other production-class user for the past three years. Perhaps his ignorance was mercy.\n\n---\n\n> **[Production of Cloth Armor has been completed.]**\n\n> **[Production of Yeti's Underwear has been completed.]**\n\n\"Normal rating. Again.\"\n\nGrid traveled the road from Frontier to Reinhardt, clicking the production button religiously every two hours. Compared to blacksmithing—which demanded his complete attention through every stage of creation—tailoring felt almost criminally easy.\n\nThe problem? Every single item came out Normal-rated.\n\n*Damn it... of course it wouldn't be that simple.*\n\nExpecting to produce high-quality items every two hours without effort or risk had been foolish. He reached the obvious conclusion: the production system would never yield anything above Normal rating.\n\n*Which means I'll have to level tailoring the hard way...*\n\nThe production button was effectively useless for serious progression. He'd need to craft items manually if he wanted results.\n\nHis mood had soured considerably by the time he reached Reinhardt—and promptly received the worst possible news from Lauel.\n\n\"An envoy from the Saharan Empire has arrived.\"\n\n\"What? The Empire?\" Grid's eyebrows shot up. \"They've been ignoring us until now. Why send someone?\"\n\n\"I believe they're here to demand tribute.\"\n\n\"Are you insane? Why would we pay tribute to the Empire?\"\n\nThe Overgeared Kingdom had barely achieved stable footing. Only three months post-founding, tax revenues had *just* climbed out of the deficit. Tribute payments at this stage could cripple them.\n\n\"Greedy bastards.\"\n\nStill cursing under his breath, Grid made his way to the audience chamber.\n\nThe envoy waiting for him was a woman. Beautiful, composed, with perfect posture that spoke of military discipline. Her nameplate floated above her head in glittering gold script: **Mercedes**.\n\n*A Named NPC?*\n\nWas the Empire trying to intimidate them with big names right from the start?\n\nMercedes offered a brief, precise bow.\n\n\"I have come before the Overgeared King Grid to convey the will of the Great Emperor.\"\n\n> **[Mercedes' deep eyes have looked at you.]**\n\n> **[Some of your stats and skills are forcibly revealed to Mercedes.]**\n\n> **[You cannot resist.]**\n\n> **[Mercedes' sharp sword energy threatens you. The overwhelming pressure constricts your mind and body. All speeds -30%, skill casting speed -20%.]**\n\n> **[You have resisted.]**\n\n> **[Status reflection has failed.]**\n\nAn absolute existence—one of the legendary figures scattered across this world—had finally appeared before Grid."
