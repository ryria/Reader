Rabbit's administrative reports came first, followed by updates from the Overgeared Guild. An hour crawled past. His eyes burned.\n\n*I'm so tired.*\n\nFive weeks of constant questing had hollowed him out. The lack of real sleep gnawed at him worse than any monster.\n\n\"Grid, are you departing for the Vatican?\"\n\nDamian caught him just outside the meeting room. The paladin's face was taut with barely suppressed urgency.\n\nGrid held up a hand. \"I need to rest first. I'll contact you later, so head there ahead of me.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nDamian's jaw worked. He wanted to drag Grid to the Vatican immediately. The thought of Isabel suffering at this very moment made his chest tighten. But he forced himself to step back. He'd already waited months. What were another day or two?\n\nHe bowed as Grid's avatar dissolved into logout particles.\n\nGrid went straight to bed.\n\n***\n\nTen months of Satisfy time had passed since the National Competition.\n\nYura had dedicated every waking hour to a single quest.\n\n> **[Path of Penance]**\n>\n> **Difficulty Level:** SS\n>\n> Meet the First Servant unharmed.\n>\n> **Quest Clear Rewards:** ???\n\nNo clues. No hints. Just that single, maddening objective.\n\nDuring the quest, Yura had faced endless trials. Frustration had clawed at her more times than she could count. But she refused to quit. *You don't reach 5th in the unified rankings by giving up.* Her tenacity went beyond normal human stubbornness.\n\n*I finally found it.*\n\nDirt and dried blood covered her armor, but her beauty remained undimmed. White skin like porcelain. Ebony hair that caught what little light existed in this place. She looked like something out of a painting as she crossed the cave threshold.\n\nHer boots echoed against stone as she approached the altar.\n\nA pure white flame danced atop it.\n\n\"Lovely child, you have reached this place with your weak human body.\"\n\nThe voice was impossibly sweet. Beautiful in a way that made Yura's skin prickle. Her eyes narrowed behind her lashes.\n\n*My guess was right.*\n\nEverything about Yatan's First Servant had been shrouded in mystery. Now she understood why. The white flame before her wasn't human at all. It was something far worse.\n\nA demon's soul.\n\n\"You are entitled to receive my power, Amoract's power.\"\n\nThe demon of conflict. One of the 33 great demons. Yatan's First Servant.\n\n*Demon. Demonic views. A religion founded by demons.*\n\nThe pieces had been there all along. The Yatan Church's true aim was bringing the 33 great demons to earth. Yatan's servants included the demonkin Balak and others like him. Legend claimed the 33 great demons were creatures of God Yatan himself.\n\nIt all pointed to one conclusion. The Yatan Church was no human institution. It was humanity's enemy.\n\n\"Child, I will give you infinite power.\"\n\nAmoract's voice dripped with promise.\n\n\"I will help you break away from that weak human body.\"\n\nSystem windows materialized in front of Yura.\n\n> **[The quest 'Path of Penance (SS)' has been cleared.]**\n>\n> **[If you accept Amoract's magic power, you will be changed from human to half-demonkin. Demonkin can evolve into demons.]**\n>\n> **[Will you accept Amoract's magic power?]**\n\n*A choice?*\n\nThe quest was giving her an option to refuse the reward. Unprecedented. Quest rewards were supposed to be automatic, something you accepted or lost by failing. The fact that she could choose meant something.\n\nYura's mind raced. Years of experience and accumulated knowledge clicked into place. Her high intelligence stat wasn't just for show.\n\nShe found her answer.\n\n\"I'll refuse.\"\n\nThe white flame convulsed. Shock radiated from Amoract's soul.\n\n\"Child, why? Why are you refusing my power?\"\n\nYura said nothing.\n\n\"Child, do you intend to betray God Yatan?\"\n\nShe'd committed many wrongs since becoming a black magician. Joining the Yatan Church had required it. The path of evil always demanded conflict, always required harming others.\n\nDid she feel guilty? *A little uncomfortable, but nothing I couldn't handle.* Satisfy was a game. Different from reality. She knew the line between good and evil. She wasn't evil in real life. She'd simply played her role as a user who chose the dark path. The result had been becoming Yatan's Servant.\n\nBut now irritation flared hot in her chest. Was guilt finally catching up? No. There was another reason.\n\n\"Yes, I intend to betray you.\" She met the flame with clear, unflinching eyes. \"If I accept your strength and remain God Yatan's Servant forever, I'll eventually become the enemy of someone important to me.\"\n\n\"Man? Who are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Grid.\" Yura's gaze seemed to pierce through to Amoract's very core. \"The Yatan Servants' Slaughterer.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nNews had reached her recently. Grid had killed Dark Bus. Three Yatan Servants total. The Yatan Church had marked Grid as an enemy long ago. *I don't want to support them anymore.* But leaving meant losing everything she'd built.\n\nNow the situation had changed. Why else would an SS-grade quest give her a choice? *Hidden reward.* The answer was obvious.\n\n\"I'm quitting as Yatan's Servant.\" She straightened her shoulders. \"In fact, I never liked Yatan from the beginning.\"\n\n*I just chose black magician because it seemed interesting.* If she'd known it meant eternal servitude to Yatan, she would have picked something else.\n\n\"Disgraceful girl!\"\n\nAmoract's gentle voice twisted into something monstrous. The sheer pressure of the demon's rage felt like it could crush her. But Yura held her ground. She knew Amoract couldn't manifest on earth. Not yet.\n\nSystem notifications cascaded.\n\n> **[You have refused Amoract's magic power.]**\n>\n> **[You have been deprived of your position as Yatan's Servant.]**\n>\n> **[You are expelled from the Yatan Church.]**\n>\n> **[You have lost your black magic power.]**\n>\n> **[The Yatan Church will be forever hostile to you.]**\n>\n> **[The legendary class, Demon Slayer, has been obtained.]**\n>\n> **[Your level has dropped.]**\n>\n> **[You are now level 1.]**\n\n\"Oh my.\"\n\n*Legendary class, yes. Expected that.* The level drop to one, though. That she hadn't seen coming.\n\nThe skill list for her new class appeared before her wide eyes.\n\nOn this day, Yura's name vanished from the ranker list. The forums exploded with speculation within the hour.\n\n***\n\n4:30 AM. Youngwoo woke after thirteen hours of sleep. He stumbled out of his room with vacant eyes, only to find his parents awake.\n\n\"Son! Why is it so hard to see you when we live in the same house?\"\n\nHis mother's voice was half-scolding, half-affectionate. His father nodded beside her.\n\n\"It's been ten days.\"\n\n*That long?* Youngwoo's parents ran their farm and vegetable store. They left early, came home late. Youngwoo spent most of his time in the capsule. The last twelve days especially, he'd barely logged out. *No wonder we keep missing each other.*\n\n\"I heard your story on the news a few days ago.\" His mother fussed with her apron. \"I know you're busy doing important things, but don't overdo it.\"\n\n\"Take care of your health.\" His father's gruff voice softened. \"You haven't been exercising recently. If you get sick, we won't be the only ones who feel sad.\"\n\n*Important things. For the nation.*\n\nYoungwoo still hadn't adjusted to being treated like a hero. The gap between now and when people mocked him as a game-obsessed loser felt impossibly wide.\n\n*But I succeeded. I actually made it in my field.*\n\nPride warmed his chest. Especially seeing how proud his parents were. He was mid-stretch, listening to them, when something clicked.\n\n\"Wait. I appeared on the news?\"\n\n\"Yes, something about seven or eight guilds invading your city?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You and your colleagues repelled them without any damage?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Some unbelievably great earl helped you? Asura? Ashur?\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"The experts on TV praise our son every day. Ohoho.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nConfusion fogged Youngwoo's brain. Nothing his parents said made sense.\n\n*An alliance of seven guilds tried to invade Reidan. Earl Ashur defeated them?*\n\nWhy hadn't he heard about this?\n\n*That Lauel.*\n\nThe 'little thing' Lauel mentioned. *This is what he meant by 'little'?*\n\nYoungwoo laughed despite himself. He could guess why the Overgeared Guild hadn't reported it. *No damage, so not important.* They hadn't wanted to disturb his quest. Then when he'd returned, he'd been too exhausted to stay online long enough for a full briefing.\n\n*They were looking out for me.*\n\nIn the past, Shin Youngwoo had been a poison pill. Selfish. Alone by choice and circumstance. He'd respected no one. Cared for no one.\n\nNot anymore. After success came the luxury of caring for others. And in return, they cared for him. Respected him. *Friends. I actually have friends now.*\n\nThese were truly happy days.\n\n\"It's been a while, hasn't it?\"\n\nBreakfast with his parents finished, Sehee emerged from the bathroom in a cloud of steam. Had she gotten prettier in the short time since he'd last seen her?\n\n\"You've grown.\" Youngwoo looked her over from head to toe.\n\nSehee's cheeks colored. \"Where are you looking, pervert?\"\n\n\"Pervert?\"\n\n*How is observing my sister's growth perverted?* Sehee threw a white sweatshirt at his bewildered face.\n\n\"Now that you have time to relax, shouldn't you go exercise?\"\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\nThe last twelve days, he'd barely moved except for light stretches and push-ups. *Frustrating.* He was pleased Sehee offered to run with him.\n\nThey went out into the pre-dawn air. Youngwoo ran with uncharacteristic enthusiasm, letting the clean morning air fill his lungs. His body loosened. His spirit lifted.\n\nWhen they returned home, a man was waiting.\n\n\"First time we've met in reality.\"\n\nPeak Sword stood at their doorstep. Not Peak Mine anymore. Peak Sword.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**\n\n**OG: Glossary Link.**\n\n**Current schedule: 20 chapters a week.**\n\n**Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and to help achieve the goals for extra chapters.
