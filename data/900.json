  "content": "Exhaustion. That was the real problem.\n\nAgnus' body could barely manage reflexive movements anymore. His trembling pupils steadied as his expression twisted—tears threatening at the corners of his eyes. When he looked up, his gaze had sharpened into something dangerous.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nHe recognized the woman hauling him upright. Euphemina. One of the Overgeared Kingdom's meritorious retainers, instrumental in Valhalla's founding. By all accounts, someone Grid trusted implicitly. And wasn't she after Mumud? So why the hell was she helping *him*?\n\n\"Oof—!\" \n\nEuphemina's strength stat was pathetic—barely above a magician's. One of the reasons she avoided duplicating physical attack skills. Supporting a grown man heavier than herself proved nearly impossible. After a moment of struggle, she gave up and slumped beside him against the wall, fishing out a handkerchief.\n\n\"Why are you looking at me like that?\" She dabbed at her own face. \"What, you want to wipe your sweat too?\"\n\n\"Get lost.\" The growl earned him the nickname Mad Dog for good reason.\n\nEuphemina flinched, tucking the handkerchief away. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Are you stupid? I already told you—I'm helping you.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nThe quest window burned in his memory. *Mumud's Desire for Liberation*—failure condition: death by Euphemina's hand. She could complete her quest right now by putting him down. Yet here she was, propping him up instead of finishing the job.\n\n\"Why aren't you killing me?\"\n\n\"Well...\" She tilted her head. \"That won't be easy. The moment I deal a fatal blow, you'll just activate Lich Transformation and recover instantly, won't you?\"\n\n\"You could neutralize that window. I've seen you duplicate skills that could manage it.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Tell me honestly—what are you planning?\"\n\nAgnus had learned the hard way. His only ally was dead. Everyone else over the years had been enemies. Naturally, he couldn't trust anyone close to Grid.\n\nEuphemina widened her eyes in exaggerated innocence. \"Don't you have any friends? Why do you keep doubting people's goodwill? Just accept the help.\"\n\n\"Would you? If you were me?\"\n\n\"Of course. A beautiful, pure-hearted woman offers you aid, and you question her motives?\" She placed a hand on her chest. \"You should be grateful. Shouldn't everyone be kind to someone as lovely as me?\"\n\n\"You're a kid.\"\n\n\"Why are you calling a *grown woman* a kid?\"\n\nDespite being in her early twenties, Euphemina stood only 150 centimeters tall with features that could pass for middle school. A sore spot she was particularly sensitive about.\n\n\"Grown woman...?\" Agnus looked her up and down. No matter the angle, she was a kid.\n\nHer face flushed crimson. \"I-I didn't mean big in *that* way! I'm still developing, but I'm an adult! Not a kid!\"\n\n\"...\" How had he ended up having *this* conversation with one of Grid's closest allies? The absurdity of it cut through his exhaustion. His stamina had recovered enough. Agnus pushed himself upright. \"Get lost. I'll spare you this once.\"\n\nThe words came out patronizing rather than grateful.\n\n\"Are you deaf?\" Euphemina's tone shifted. \"I told you—I'll help you craft it. The Stone of Life.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"If you free Mumud—\"\n\nThe explosion swallowed her words and her body. The blast tore through ten houses surrounding the narrow alley. When the smoke cleared, Euphemina's small frame had vanished without a trace.\n\n\"...Found you.\"\n\nJuden, capital of the Murray Kingdom. Agnus had been identified as the murderer of accessory maker Catherine. He'd already cut through several city guards. He should have fled immediately. He'd taken too long.\n\n\"Capture him!\" \n\nThe magicians who'd bombarded Euphemina's position redirected their attention. Knights swarmed from all sides while hundreds of soldiers formed ranks behind them. High-level troops, well-coordinated. More than any single player could handle alone.\n\nOf course, Agnus wasn't normal.\n\n\"Kikikik... Numbers mean nothing to me.\"\n\nHis foot stamped down. The ground trembled. Skeleton soldiers clawed free from the earth.\n\n\"Eh? Ughh!\"\n\n\"Stop them!\"\n\nThe advancing soldiers paled at the sight of armed skeletons. Without the knights and magicians supporting them, the casualties would have been catastrophic.\n\n\"Evil necromancer!\" One knight's shout carried over the chaos.\n\nFrom their perspective, Agnus had invaded their capital, murdered civilians and guards alike. The knight's voice shook with righteous fury. As Agnus converted fallen soldiers into undead, the younger knights found themselves unable to advance. Surrounded by skeleton soldiers, he seemed impregnable.\n\nIn reality, he was crumbling.\n\n\"Kik! Kikikik!\"\n\nThe successive pursuits had pushed his resources to the breaking point. Stamina and mana depleted. Critical spells on cooldown. When the magicians focused fire on his summons, the skeleton soldiers disintegrated rapidly. As their numbers dwindled, Murray Kingdom's forces pressed in with spears and swords.\n\n\"...Kik!\"\n\nPain and fear stabbed through his frontal lobe. The agonizing memories of reality dissolved, replaced by twisted pleasure. Agnus' smile widened even as spears pierced his flesh. He'd been nervous, weakened by the prospect of reuniting with his lost love. Now his true nature as a mad dog reasserted itself.\n\n\"Keeok!\"\n\n\"T-This monster... Kuaaack!\"\n\n\"Kahahahat! Ha—?\"\n\nHe trusted in Lich Transformation. But as Agnus tore through enemy ranks, his body suddenly crumpled. The blade that descended from above punched through his shoulder and chest in one brutal thrust.\n\n> **[You have suffered 27,900 damage.]**\n>\n> **[You have fallen into the 'Internal Injury' state.]**\n>\n> **[This is a physical phenomenon. Resisting the status has failed.]**\n>\n> **[All resource recovery speeds are reduced by 30%. Accompanied by the 'Bleeding (Large)' status, this causes your health to drop continuously.]**\n\n\"Kuock?\"\n\nThe blow shattered his madness. Agnus gasped at the terrible pain, immediately thinking of Grid. An attack powerful enough to make him believe the Overgeared King had pursued him across kingdoms.\n\nBut it wasn't Grid.\n\nThe middle-aged man who landed and wrenched his sword free wore faded red armor.\n\n\"Time to repay the Murray Kingdom's grace.\"\n\n\"Ohh...!\"\n\n\"Sir Singuled!\"\n\nThe terrified knights and soldiers erupted in cheers. The battlefield transformed into a festival ground, with Agnus cast as the clown.\n\n*Who?* The wounded mad dog studied this unwelcome guest.\n\n\"There you are.\"\n\n\"Finally found you.\"\n\nTwo more soldiers pushed through to center stage. Both wore standard issue armor—nothing distinguished them from common troops.\n\n\"You are...?\" Former Red Knight Singuled tensed.\n\nOne soldier removed his helmet. \"A soldier... No. The traitor who betrayed you and dragged you into ruin.\"\n\nThe golden nameplate 'Asmophel' materialized above the noble-featured man's head.\n\nSinguled's face contorted into something demonic. \"You...! Asmopheeeeell!\"\n\n\"...???\" Agnus stared in utter confusion.\n\n*What is this?*\n\nHidden among the enemy forces since the explosion, Euphemina watched in equal bewilderment as Asmophel appeared.\n\n\"You haven't completed the Seven Malignant Saints quest yet.\" The unidentified soldier beside Asmophel approached Agnus, removing his own helmet to reveal the name 'Haster'. \"At this rate, the strongest players are Grid and Kraugel.\"\n\nThe unexpected developments left everyone present thoroughly confused. Had Grid witnessed this situation, he would have ordered fried chicken and settled in to watch the chaos unfold.\n\n***\n\n*[...This is the phenomenon of Brain Learning.

This trend concerns experts across all fields—those who've spent decades honing their craft now face a crisis of motivation and purpose, while mentally unprepared youth suddenly wield abilities developed in mere months without the discipline to control them...]*\n\n\"I'm hungry.\"\n\nYoungwoo switched on the TV as he climbed out of the capsule, then shook his head. His stomach gnawed at him while the news reporters' voices flowed through one ear and out the other.\n\n*[NASA has identified an asteroid weighing 56 billion kilograms. The massive object, 300 meters in diameter, currently orbits the sun at 80,000 kilometers per hour. Impact with Earth would generate devastation several times greater than an atomic bomb.]*\n\n*[Collision is estimated to occur in five years. It makes no sense. NASA's technology should have detected this asteroid's approach years ago. If their data is accurate, the asteroid simply appeared one day—a physical impossibility...]*\n\n*[...NASA maintains there's only a 1 in 4,500 chance of Earth impact, and they're well-prepared to address the situation.]*\n\nThe composed voices of experts attempting to soothe agitated hosts tangled together in meaningless noise.\n\n\"Turn off the TV.\"\n\nYoungwoo killed the feed and headed for the kitchen. Sunlight streamed through large windows, illuminating equipment that would satisfy any five-star restaurant chef. He stood before the stove, waiting for water to boil in a pot. Then pulled out a packet of ramen.\n\nThe power of a high-end induction cooker.\n\n\"Haah...\" The water roiled almost instantly. Youngwoo sighed as he dropped in the noodle block. \"My clone...\"\n\nEuphemina hadn't responded to his whispers. He'd logged out to take a break, but tension coiled in his gut again. He'd wanted to bring backup for this confrontation—an enemy where luck alone might not be enough. But what if Yura or Euphemina died because of him? Could he shoulder that responsibility? The penalties they'd suffer?\n\n\"I should go alone.\" \n\nHe prodded his empty stomach, wondering if Euphemina's silence was divine intervention. Youngwoo cleared his mind while finishing the ramen, then returned to the capsule.\n\n\"This is my burden in the end. I'll handle it myself.\"\n\nHis eyes hardened as he logged in.\n\n> **[Welcome to Satisfy.]**\n\nYoungwoo became Overgeared King Grid.\n\n> **[The presence in Hell, who has captured your location, has arrived on the Surface.]**\n\nThe system notification materialized.\n\n\"...?\"\n\nGoosebumps rippled across Grid's skin."
