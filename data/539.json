  "content": "**Wave**, the most basic technique of **Pagma's Swordsmanship**, dealt the lowest damage of all the sword dances. At level 6, it inflicted only 230% of his attack power—barely double his base damage. For a legendary-rated skill, the numbers were pathetically weak. It had *some* utility as an area-of-effect technique, but even that advantage had faded after the introduction of third advancement class abilities.\n\nStill, the skill retained one unique strength: every target struck by the energy wave suffered a movement speed debuff. In other words, **Wave** functioned as area-of-effect crowd control. Naturally, such utility came at the cost of raw damage output.\n\nAt least, that was true for ordinary players.\n\n\"**Wave**.\"\n\nWhite light blazed along the length of **Failure**—the telltale glow of a +9 enhanced weapon. A crushing wave of energy erupted from the blue greatsword and slammed into the armored needles pursuing the Red Phoenix members.\n\n*Ku-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa! Ku-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!*\n\nThe explosion rattled the dungeon walls. Black ichor sprayed from the monsters' carapaces as chunks of stone rained from the ceiling, unable to withstand the shockwave.\n\n> You have dealt 15,310 damage to the target.\n> The target's speed has decreased by 63%.\n\n> You have dealt 16,004 damage to the target.\n> The target's…\n\n> You have dealt…\n\n\"Y-You…?\"\n\nSua stared at Grid, her expression caught between awe and disbelief. *A blacksmith using swordsmanship? And at this level of mastery?*\n\n\"What… what *are* you?\"\n\nGrid tightened his arm around her waist, pulling her closer to shield her from the spray of corrosive blood. The armored needles' ichor dissolved anything it touched—stone, metal, flesh. Even with Grid's enhanced reflexes, dodging every drop was impossible.\n\n*Damn it. I need backup.*\n\n\"**God Hands**!\"\n\n*Pa-pa-pa-pat!*\n\nFour golden hands materialized instantly, responding to Grid's summons. They moved with inhuman precision, intercepting sprays of blood before they could reach Grid or Sua.\n\n*Chiiiiik!*\n\nThe **God Hands** hissed and steamed where the acidic ichor struck them, but they held firm. Sua's eyes widened further.\n\n*They're undamaged despite direct contact with the blood? And they move independently?*\n\nThe people of the East Continent possessed broad cultural knowledge. The royal treasure vaults contained countless artifacts that defied common sense—constructs that moved with their own will, weapons imbued with ancient power. In Sua's eyes, the **God Hands** appeared to be divine relics, proof that Grid was a cultivator who had somehow mastered both smithing and the sword arts. Mysterious. Overwhelming.\n\nMeanwhile, Grid was simply relieved.\n\n*Thank god she's wearing armor.*\n\nHe'd hesitated before wrapping his arm around her. His absurdly high **Dexterity** stat had caused… *complications* in the past. Fortunately, Sua's thick plate mail served as insulation against his unconsciously sensitive touch. She hadn't noticed anything inappropriate.\n\n\"Fall back,\" Grid commanded, releasing Sua once the armored needles had been fully debuffed. \"Get your people out of range.\"\n\nThe Red Phoenix members caught Sua and began retreating.\n\n\"What *is* his true identity?\"\n\n\"A blacksmith wielding sword techniques like that…\"\n\n\"Didn't he restore the Red Phoenix Bow using white phosphorus wood? Could he be a Daoist immortal in disguise?\"\n\n*They don't know Pagma's name?*\n\nWhite had mentioned the existence of a legendary blacksmith on the East Continent. Moreover, Pagma himself was rumored to have originated from these lands. Grid had assumed the name would carry weight here.\n\nApparently not.\n\n*Well, not everyone would know about a legendary blacksmith, I suppose.*\n\nPagma's activities had been concentrated on the West Continent. It made sense his reputation here would be limited.\n\n*Which means my achievements here might actually surpass his legacy.*\n\nHis pulse quickened at the thought. A frontier where no one had yet left their mark. The opportunity to carve out entirely new accomplishments. Grid's lips twisted into a greedy smile as he turned back toward Sua and her team.\n\n\"You're being reckless for a squad that's supposedly been clearing this dungeon for years. Is this normal for you, or are you just having an off day?\"\n\nGrid's tone dripped with disappointment. To nearly wipe in their *first* engagement after entering the dungeon—it was absurd. Pathetic, even. The armored needles were strong, certainly, but the Red Phoenix group's performance fell far below his expectations.\n\n\"That's…\"\n\nThe sarcasm cut deep, undermining their pride as Pangea's elite defenders. Yet none of the Red Phoenix members protested. They couldn't. They *weren't qualified* to protest. They understood Grid's point too well.\n\n\"…\"\n\nAfter a tense silence, Sua spoke up.\n\n\"Normally, armored needles operate alone. We've been exploring this dungeon for years, and this is the first time we've encountered *five* at once.\"\n\nRed Phoenix operated in eight-person teams specifically because eight people were required to safely hunt a *single* armored needle. The most they'd ever faced simultaneously was three. Encountering five was a statistical anomaly. Under the circumstances, the team deserved credit for not immediately panicking.\n\nBut the results spoke for themselves. Without Grid's intervention, they'd all be dead.\n\n\"I'm not trying to make excuses. We failed to prepare for a worst-case scenario, and that's on us. And…\" Sua bowed deeply. \"Thank you.\"\n\nGrid didn't respond. His attention had snapped back to the battle—the **God Hands** were losing ground against the armored needles!\n\n*Already?*\n\nCounting the fused specimen, there were six armored needles total. Grid had expected the **God Hands'** infinite stiffness combo to lock them down for at least twenty seconds. Instead, the monsters had broken free in less than ten.\n\n*They're overpowering Mjolnir's crowd control with raw stats?*\n\nGrid had felt it when the gatekeeper Ung struck him—these dungeon bosses operated on an entirely different power scale. The evidence lay before him: his lead **God Hand**, equipped with the Ultimate Enhanced **Mjolnir** and dealing maximum damage output, now stood immobilized by silver thread. The remaining three **God Hands** frantically dodged additional strands.\n\n*No holding back.*\n\nGrid categorized the armored needles as proper boss monsters and summoned his remaining forces.\n\n\"**Noe**!\"\n\n\"*Nyang!*\"\n\nA comical sound effect accompanied the appearance of a black cat.\n\n\"The best demonic beast of Hell has arrived! *Nyang!*\"\n\n\"**Randy**!\"\n\n\"I shall assist.\"\n\nA perfect duplicate of Grid materialized beside the original.\n\nA talking cat. Two identical warriors.\n\nThe Red Phoenix members gawked.\n\n*'A sacred creature!'*\n\n*'Cloning techniques!'*\n\n*'He's definitely a Daoist cultivator!'*\n\nTheir assumptions were perfectly natural. Grid was simply too abnormal. Not that he cared what they thought—he was already issuing orders.\n\n\"Noe, drain the stats from the fused armored needle. Randy, use ranged skills to support me. Create openings for the **God Hands** to strike.\"\n\n\"I understand! *Nyang!*\"\n\n\"Acknowledged.\"\n\nWatching the armored needles shatter his infinite stiffness combo confirmed Grid's suspicions. The Red Phoenix members weren't weak—they were elite by any standard. The problem was that the armored needles were simply *that* strong. This would be a contest of pure offensive power. No room for restraint.\n\n\"**Linked Kill Wave**.\"\n\nThe armored needles possessed the typical weaknesses of undead monsters: minimal intelligence and no tactical coordination. As they surged down the relatively narrow passage, they interfered with each other's movements, clustering together. In this confined space, avoiding **Linked Kill Wave** was impossible.\n\n*Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwang!*\n\n**Linked Kill Wave** dealt exponentially more damage than **Wave**—eight energy blades, each containing 1,500% of his attack power. The armored needles caught in the onslaught were instantly shredded, their health bars plummeting below half.\n\nGrid's momentum surged. He calmly prepared to finish them off as they rushed forward.\n\n*If possible, let's conserve the teleportation talisman for this fight.*\n\nWhich meant *not getting hit*. Dodging six boss monsters without taking a single blow was an absurd goal. But Grid was dead serious.\n\n\"**Transcend**.\"\n\nIn an instant, the transformation completed. Grid's hair swept upward as if caught in an updraft, exposing his sharp eyes and pointed ears. He retreated two steps and slashed twice.\n\nTwo energy blades shot forth.\n\n*Pe-peng!*\n\n*Pe-pe-peng!*\n\n\"*Kyaaak!*\"\n\n**Transcend's** fraudulent power had proven itself countless times before. It converted all basic attacks into ranged strikes dealing double damage. And if combat buffs were layered on top of that foundation? The result was bombardment that nothing could endure.\n\n\"**Blacksmith's Rage**.\"\n\n> Blacksmith's Rage activated.\n> Attack power increased by 25%.\n> Attack speed increased by 40% for 35 seconds.\n\n\"*Kyaaaak!*\"\n\nThe armored needles shrieked in fury, enraged at being torn apart by what should have been prey. They accelerated toward Grid.\n\n*Pe-pe-pe-peng!*\n\n*Pe-pe-pe-pe-ok!*\n\nEmpowered by **Blacksmith's Rage**, Grid unleashed three or four slashes per second while backpedaling. The armored needles' advance faltered. The lead specimen's health bar flickered on the verge of depletion. Grid grinned.\n\n\"Hahaha! Too slow! Way too slow!\"\n\n\"…\"\n\nSua and the Red Phoenix members could only watch in stunned silence. The nightmarish creatures that had claimed so many lives over the years—the dreaded armored needles—were being treated like training dummies.\n\n\"How can anyone be this stro— Ah!\"\n\nThe entire Red Phoenix group flinched in unison.\n\n*Pu-ook!*\n\nSeveral strands of silver thread erupted from the ground *behind* Grid. One of the armored needles had secretly threaded the attack through the dungeon floor.\n\n\"Behind you!\"\n\nSua's warning came too late. Grid was focused on the enemies in front of him, his attention split between offense and positioning. He wouldn't be able to react in time—\n\n\"Ah…!\"\n\nJust as despair gripped Sua and her team—\n\n\"Come forth! **Overgeared Skeletons**!\"\n\n*Pa-hat!*\n\nTwo skeletal warriors burst from the ground directly in the path of the emerging threads, intercepting them before they could reach Grid.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nSummoning skeletons wasn't particularly rare on the East Continent. Using them as disposable shields, however—that was uncommon. Grid immediately re-summoned replacement skeletons without missing a beat.\n\n*Good thing the East Continent has such high ambient mana density.*\n\nThe environment synergized perfectly with the **Ring of Absurdity**.\n\n*Clack! Clack-clack-clack-clack!*\n\n*Peok! Pa-sak!*\n\nNoe, Randy, and the **God Hands** maintained offensive pressure while the **Overgeared Skeletons** intercepted silver threads. Then a notification window appeared.\n\n> Overgeared Skeleton (1) and Overgeared Skeleton (2) are gradually adapting to the silver thread's properties."
