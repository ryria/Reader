Within moments, overwhelming heat flooded the smithy.\n\n*His Majesty's begun!*\n\nEvery blacksmith's attention locked onto Grid. Since Khan's death, only one man could command flames with such absolute mastery, bending heat and temperature to his will.\n\n*In his final years...*\n\n*Khan wielded fire just as brilliantly...*\n\nTears pricked at the craftsmen's eyes as memories surfaced unbidden.\n\n\"Kraugel.\" Grid seized a hammer and anvil, turning to face his guest. \"Three options.\"\n\nHe laid them out methodically. \"First—if you have a specific item in mind, provide the production method. I'll learn the design and craft it for you. You already know what that means, right? Anything I forge performs better than the blueprint promises.\"\n\nFrom Grid's perspective, it was a windfall—free designs, no strings attached.\n\n\"Second—leave the design entirely to me. I'll work from my existing production methods.\"\n\n\"That sounds incredible.\"\n\n\"Naturally. You'd be receiving something forged by a legendary blacksmith.\"\n\n\"Then I'll obviously—\"\n\nKraugel leaned toward the second option. Who wouldn't? He'd witnessed the devastating power of Grid's own blade. But Grid raised a hand, cutting him off.\n\n\"Wait. Hear me out.\"\n\nGrid's thoughts drifted to Khan. How many times had the old master guided him through unfamiliar territory when creating new items? Khan's insight had been invaluable—which materials to select, what properties to emphasize, how to balance conflicting attributes. The greatest blacksmith Grid had ever known had shared his wisdom freely, asking nothing in return.\n\nNow Grid wanted Kraugel to fill that void. He wanted Kraugel's knowledge, his expertise. Together, they could forge something truly transcendent—the strongest sword imaginable.\n\n\"Kraugel.\" Grid held his gaze. \"What's your ideal sword?\"\n\n\"...Excuse me?\"\n\n\"Tell me. I'll make your vision real with my hands.\"\n\n\"...That's the third option?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n*Thump.*\n\nKraugel's heart hammered against his ribs. His Swordsmanship Creation skill flashed through his mind—a unique ability to devise new techniques. If he possessed that, then surely Grid wielded something similar for items.\n\nHe clenched his fists to steady his trembling hands.\n\n\"My name will be written into the Overgeared King's history...\" Kraugel spoke carefully. \"Future generations will know I was part of your legend. You're certain that's acceptable?\"\n\nIt was a calculated question. Kraugel understood how the powerful operated. The higher someone climbed, the more jealously they guarded their achievements. They wanted no one else stealing even a fraction of their glory.\n\nGrid's response came without hesitation. \"Acceptable? Is that really a question? It's not acceptable—it's an honor.\"\n\nHe remembered watching Kraugel master Piaro's technique during the Belial Raid. That had been Kraugel's tribute to the legendary swordsman. This was Grid's tribute in return.\n\n\"The greatest blacksmith and the greatest swordsman, forging the ultimate blade together.\" Grid smiled. \"Won't that become its own legend?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Let's create it together. The strongest sword. The finest legend.\"\n\nGrid thought of the legends he knew. Undefeated King Madra fought for his kingdom his entire life, only to be beheaded by his own son. Pagma betrayed a friend in a desperate bid to save the world, contracting with a great demon. Braham recognized the world's cruelty and scorned his own kind, only to be betrayed by that same friend when his vampire nature was revealed.\n\nEvery legend Grid knew ended in tragedy and condemnation. He refused to follow that path. And Kraugel felt the same.\n\n\"...The honor is mine.\" Kraugel's voice was firm.\n\n\"Good. Then let's begin.\" Grid activated his skill. \"Legendary Blacksmith's Creation.\"\n\n[Legendary Blacksmith's Creation]\n\n*A skill that allows the creation of three equipment production methods each time Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship levels up.*\n\n*Available creations: 9/24*\n\n*Note: Items created through this skill automatically bear the creator's name.*\n\n*Vwoom—*\n\nA pristine, empty blueprint materialized before them.\n\n\"The ideal sword, informed by a Sword Saint's knowledge...\" Grid studied the blank canvas. \"What are your thoughts?\"\n\n\"It varies by individual, but generally speaking—a heavy sword.\" Kraugel's tone became professorial. \"Optimal balance of width, length, and weight. Maximum versatility. When accounting for all variables, it's the most universally practical choice.\"\n\n\"Really? I'd have guessed a longsword. My Enlightenment Blade is a longsword that channels black flames.\"\n\n\"Have you trained extensively with heavy swords?\"\n\n\"Not particularly. I've always favored greatswords or longswords...\"\n\n\"...Well, as I said—ideals differ between individuals. Perhaps it's arrogant to even discuss a single ideal form. A knife excels at cutting fruit. A machete dominates in dense jungle. Purpose dictates design.\"\n\nThe experience and insight of a Sword Saint merged with the techniques and understanding of a legendary blacksmith.\n\n\"But for combat versatility, a heavy sword reigns supreme?\" Grid pressed. \"Any other distinguishing features?\"\n\n\"None come to mind.\"\n\n\"Would you consider adding functionality through a distinct shape? Like Failure's shark-fin design?\"\n\n\"If there's no specific requirement, the traditional form is best. Even weight distribution matters more than shifting the center of gravity to either side.\"\n\n\"Exactly. That's why sword cross-sections are typically diamond-shaped.\"\n\n\"Cross-section?\"\n\n\"The profile you'd see if you sliced the blade horizontally. Perfect diamonds ensure ideal balance. Though personally, I favor hexagonal or octagonal profiles.\"\n\n\"I'm not familiar with those technicalities.\"\n\n\"That's because you don't know me well enough.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"I'm a legendary blacksmith. Even if I add elaborate decorations to the blade, I can maintain perfect balance through sheer skill alone. So tell me what you're envisioning. What properties do you want?\"\n\n\"This is fascinating...\"\n\n*Buzz buzz.*\n\nThe gathered blacksmiths began murmuring among themselves. The sight of their king earnestly consulting this black-haired stranger intrigued and confused them in equal measure.\n\n\"Who is that man?\"\n\nThe four master craftsmen from Pangea—White among them—were most shocked. They recognized Kraugel as Pangea's \"Little Hero,\" renowned as a formidable warrior. Not a blacksmith. Yet Grid treated his opinions as gospel.\n\n*Why?*\n\nCould this man truly fill Khan's irreplaceable void? The question hung unspoken in every blacksmith's mind.\n\n\"He is a saint of the sword.\" Panmir's voice cut through the whispers.\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"The first Sword Saint since Muller.\"\n\n\"...!!\"\n\nThe youngest blacksmith's revelation sent shockwaves through the forge. The artisans stared at this unassuming figure with newfound awe, speechless.\n\nPanmir continued, \"Won't those two forge the greatest sword in history?\"\n\nNo one could dispute it. Imagination ran wild—what miraculous weapon would emerge from the combined knowledge, experience, and technique of a legendary blacksmith and a Sword Saint?\n\n\"Although...\" White frowned, a thought occurring to him. \"Panmir, have you finished gathering today's firewood quota?\"\n\n\"...I'll go now. But I'm coming right back to watch His Majesty work.\"\n\nPanmir's shoulders slumped. Despite being the first-ranked blacksmith in all the land, he remained the youngest—and thus lowest—member of the smithy hierarchy.\n\n---\n\nThree hours passed in intense deliberation. Finally, Grid and Kraugel finalized the sword's design. Only the materials remained.\n\n\"The Blue Dragon's Breath and White Tiger's Breath...\" Grid examined the sacred items Kraugel had brought. \"You'll use the Blue Dragon's Breath for the sword, correct? Then I'll need minerals compatible with the lightning attribute.\"\n\n\"No.\" Kraugel shook his head. \"I want the White Tiger's Breath.\"\n\n\"What?\" Grid blinked. \"But the White Tiger represents the earth attribute.\"\n\nEarth properties emphasized defense—higher durability, greater resilience. Lightning properties focused on speed and attack power. For weapons, the choice seemed obvious.\n\n\"Why use a White Tiger's Breath for your weapon? That's better suited for armor. Shouldn't you save it for defensive gear instead?\"\n\n\"This adamantium I've collected will become my armor. I'll incorporate the Blue Dragon's Breath into boots for enhanced movement speed.\"\n\n\"Even so—won't a White Tiger weapon lack offensive punch? Weapons should prioritize attack power, shouldn't they? Look at the blueprint. The sword's form already provides defensive bonuses. You want to stack even more defense?\"\n\n\"Speed translates to power, yes. But so does mass. Consider Chris's 1,000 Ton Sword.\"\n\n\"...Ah.\" Grid's worldview shifted. \"Earth-attribute minerals are inherently denser and heavier... You want to leverage that mass to amplify attack power?\"\n\n\"Precisely. Used correctly, the White Tiger's Breath can create the ultimate sword—combining devastating offense with impenetrable defense.\"\n\n\"That's actually brilliant.\"\n\nGrid thought of earth magic—stone-crushing spells packed tremendous destructive force despite their defensive reputation.\n\n\"An earth-property weapon...\"\n\nExcitement crept across Grid's face. Kraugel's logic was sound. The experimental results could be extraordinary.\n\n*And naming it will be simple.*\n\nA sword embodying earth's attributes. A sword forged from stone. The answer was obvious.\n\n\"Perfect. Let's complete the Stone Sword.\"\n\n*Stone Sword?*\n\nA chill ran down Kraugel's spine.\n\nOvergeared Guild. Overgeared Kingdom. Overgeared King. Grid's naming sense was catastrophically awful.\n\n\"Hold on, Grid—\"\n\n\"The material base will be stone. For mass production, we'll use bloodstone for enhanced versions.\"\n\nGrid was already planning ahead. Stone swords for Overgeared Knights. Bloodstone variants for himself and core guild members. From the moment he'd invited Kraugel to collaborate, his goal had been elevating the kingdom's overall military strength. Imagine an entire army wielding swords designed by a Sword Saint. The tactical advantage would be overwhelming.\n\n\"The item's name—\"\n\n\"Wait, Grid—\"\n\n\"Stone Sword.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nKraugel couldn't fathom Grid's atrocious naming conventions. At least one silver lining existed: items Grid produced typically gained additional modifiers. The weapon Kraugel would ultimately wield likely wouldn't be called simply \"Stone Sword.\" Especially with the White Tiger's Breath incorporated.\n\nBut Kraugel didn't know that yet. For now, only profound despair filled his heart."
