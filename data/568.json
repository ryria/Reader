  "content": "Could a single guild topple a kingdom? The Overgeared Guild's assault on Reinhardt had the entire world watching with bated breath. Viewers clutched their seats as armies clashed and magic lit up the sky. Here were players—ordinary adventurers—acting as the true protagonists of Satisfy's grand stage. In living rooms across the globe, people leaned toward their screens, imagining themselves commanding such power, leading such forces. Someday, they whispered to themselves. *Someday, that could be us.*\n\nThe Overgeared members' audacious move sent ripples through the game's political landscape. Competing guilds watched with growing anxiety while the broader player base buzzed with excitement and wonder.\n\n『The conditions for establishing a kingdom were revealed by the S.A. Group in their official content guide,』the commentators explained, pulling up the requirements on-screen.『First: Control at least three major cities. Second: Maintain a population of at least 100,000. Third: Secure sixty million gold for the founding ceremony.』\n\n『The Overgeared Guild currently holds two major cities—Reidan and Winston. If they succeed in conquering Reinhardt today, they'll fulfill most of the requirements for kingdom establishment.』\n\n『But wait—isn't Winston the territory of Marquis Steim?』\n\n『Technically, it belongs to Irene, the Marquis's daughter. She's also Grid's wife. If Grid can maximize his affinity with Irene, Winston could transfer to his direct control.』\n\n『We might finally witness the first player-established kingdom!』\n\n『Don't get ahead of yourself. Maximizing affinity with an NPC isn't some simple checkbox. Players rarely push relationships past ninety points. And Grid and Irene are married—they're living together. Daily friction, minor disagreements, small resentments that accumulate over time... all of that erodes affinity. Marriage is a different beast from courtship.』\n\n『Even if Grid's relationship with Irene falters, it's not necessarily a setback. The moment Reinhardt falls, the Eternal Kingdom will descend into chaos. When the kingdom fractures into dozens of competing factions, Overgeared will have plenty of opportunities to claim another major city from the rubble.』\n\nA player-controlled kingdom. The concept alone sparked heated debate. Surely it would surpass the existing feudal monarchies—a ruler with modern, progressive ideals instead of the backwards aristocracy that dominated the continent's politics. A player king would understand what adventurers needed, would develop their nation along lines that benefited the broader community.\n\n『The founding of the Overgeared Kingdom is just the beginning,』analysts projected.『Right now, NPC forces dominate the continent, but that's changing. Player organizations will gradually claim more territory, more influence. Eventually, the entire continent could be under player control.』\n\n『I can already envision it—players ruling nations, countless new heroes emerging from the chaos and opportunity. Wars, alliances, betrayals on a scale we've never seen.』\n\n『Perhaps the next legendary hero is watching this broadcast right now, learning, preparing for their moment.』\n\nCommentators from every nation spoke with near-certainty about Overgeared's imminent victory. Their forces included a great magician and the Pope himself. Reinhardt lay vulnerable before them. The kingdom seemed within their grasp.\n\nThen everything changed.\n\nKing Aslan made his terrible sacrifice—9,999 virgins offered to the abyss. Reality tore open above Reinhardt's streets.\n\nThe Great Demon emerged in apocalyptic glory. Six three-headed hellhounds pulled a chariot of black iron, and seated upon it was a goddess of destruction. Flames wreathed her form from crown to heel. The **32nd Great Demon**—Belial. She surveyed the battlefield with eyes like molten amber, and when she smiled, it was the smile of a predator regarding prey.\n\n\"So many humans gathered in one place...\" Her voice rolled across Reinhardt like distant thunder. \"How... *exciting.*\"\n\n\"...!\"\n\nThose who met Belial's gaze stumbled backward, their bodies moving before conscious thought. The commentators' voices cracked with shock.\n\n『A-A Great Demon! An actual Great Demon!』\n\n『This changes everything! The founding of the Overgeared Kingdom—it's finished before it even began!』\n\nSatisfy's boss encounters fell into three tiers of difficulty. Field bosses roamed the wilderness. Dungeon bosses guarded ancient halls. Named bosses represented the pinnacle of challenge. And among named bosses, the Great Demons stood as apex threats—sources of primordial evil that required coordinated efforts from the game's strongest players to even survive against, let alone defeat.\n\n-*I thought the Great Demon raids weren't scheduled for at least another two years...*\n\n-*Who the hell can even attempt a Great Demon raid right now? We're not ready for this!*\n\n-*The difficulty scaling on these things is insane. This is endgame content.*\n\n-*Are you kidding me? My character's logged out in Reinhardt and the server won't let me back in.*\n\n-*You'd die the instant you spawned anyway lol*\n\nSatisfy's narrative emerged organically from player actions. Billions of adventurers making choices, pursuing goals, triggering consequences—their combined efforts wove the tapestry of the game's evolving story. The summoning of a Great Demon was no different. Countless player decisions, accumulated over time, had created the conditions for this catastrophe.\n\nBut who had played the pivotal role? As the world wondered, the answer revealed herself.\n\n\"I am honored to stand before the great ruler of Hell.\"\n\nRose. The **1st ranked black magician**. While the Overgeared forces stood frozen before Belial's terrible presence, Rose dropped to her knees in reverence.\n\n\"I am Rose, a servant of Yatan. I offer my humble strength to enrich your existence in this mortal realm. Grant me permission to serve.\"\n\n-*That bitch. Of course it's her.*\n\n-*Damn Yatan Church. Always causing problems.*\n\n-*I'm so tired of these cultists. One of them kidnapped me in a leveling zone and tried to sacrifice me for some ritual.*\n\n-*This is going to be a nightmare. Great Demons and Yatan Church working together? We won't be able to farm anywhere safely.*\n\n-*Why so negative? This is amazing content! The game needs events like this to stay interesting.*\n\n-*Agreed. Think of all the new quests and rewards from fighting the demon invasion.*\n\n-*What's the point of rewards if the content's literally impossible to clear?*\n\nAs viewers debated in chat rooms worldwide, Belial regarded Rose with something approaching approval.\n\n\"Bold. I like bold.\" The Great Demon's smile widened. \"You have earned your survival.\"\n\n\"Thank you! I'm—I'm so happy!\" Rose's face flushed with ecstatic relief, her eyes gleaming with fanatic devotion.\n\n\"Can you please explain what the hell is happening right now?\" Ibellin's shout cut through the moment.\n\nThe young swordsman's fury was palpable. The Overgeared members had scattered themselves across the battlefield by design, creating opportunities for strategic strikes. The appearance of a Great Demon had shattered those plans instantly. Every careful calculation, rendered meaningless.\n\nRose turned to him with undisguised contempt. \"I simply fulfilled my role. I'm sorry if that inconvenienced the Overgeared Guild, but...\" She shrugged elegantly. \"Someone must suffer for others to prosper. Not everyone can stand equal. That's just how the world works, isn't it?\"\n\nHer expression and tone dripped with malice.\n\n\"So you've chosen to make yourself an enemy of Overgeared?\" Ibellin's hand moved to his weapon, killing intent radiating from his stance.\n\n\"**Free Farming Peak Style, Pounding Mortar.**\"\n\n\"...?\" Rose's head snapped around, confusion breaking through her smugness.\n\n*What?* A battlefield soaked in blood and screams—and some lunatic was talking about *farming techniques*? Even with a Great Demon of fear and destruction standing mere meters away?\n\n*Pounding Mortar?* Rose tried to process the absurdity. *That's a rice-processing method. Why would someone—*\n\nHer thoughts cut off. Her face went white.\n\nRose's instincts screamed warning. The ground beneath her feet seemed to darken, shadows spreading impossibly fast. She looked up—and her breath caught in her throat.\n\nSomething colossal was blotting out the sky itself. An immense mortar, the kind used to grind grain... except this one stretched over a hundred meters in diameter, a mountain of stone descending toward the earth.\n\n\"W-What is that thing?!\"\n\nA mortar was supposed to be a tool you could hold. A household implement. This—this was a siege weapon sculpted by a mad god.\n\n**KUWAAAAAAAAAANG!**\n\nThe sound split the air like a squadron of fighter jets breaking the sound barrier. The entire city of Reinhardt shook from the sonic impact.\n\n\"H-Hik...!\" Rose's voice came out as a whimper.\n\nDeath rushed toward her. The super-sized mortar plummeted like divine judgment.\n\n\"**Diamond Shield!**\" Rose thrust her staff skyward.\n\nUnderstanding could come later. First, she had to *survive.* The highest-tier defensive magic erupted around her—the spell that overcame the black magician's inherent weakness to physical attacks. Her new staff, received as reward for summoning Belial, amplified her power beyond normal limits.\n\nBut—\n\n**KUUUUUUONG!**\n\nThe mortar was simply too massive. Too heavy. Too far beyond what any defensive spell could withstand.\n\n\"...!\"\n\nRose couldn't even scream. The gigantic mortar obliterated her mind and body simultaneously, crushing her under weight measured in thousands of tons. Fear and agony lasted only a fraction of a second—a mercy, perhaps, for such a terrible death.\n\n> **[Defense is meaningless.]**\n> **[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]**\n> **[The durability of <span class=\"legendary\">Guruk's Magic Robe</span> has decreased by 230.

Exercise extreme caution.]**\n> **[You have died.]**\n> **[Experience lost: 32.8%]**\n> **[<span class=\"epic\">Superior Mana Potion (1,000 Pack)</span> has been dropped.]**\n\n*Damn it! DAMN IT! DAMN IT ALL!* Rose raged silently at the notification windows.\n\nBut the dead have no voice. She could only observe the battlefield in monochrome, a ghost bearing witness to the chaos she'd helped create.\n\n> **[You have rejected resurrection.]**\n> **[Auto-resurrection activates in 20 seconds.]**\n\n*Wait—what?*\n\nWhat in the nine hells was that technique? Rose's fury turned to bewilderment as she scanned the battlefield from her death-state perspective. The Overgeared members and soldiers stood unharmed—the mortar had somehow avoided striking them despite its massive area of effect. \n\nAnd more impossibly—\n\nBelial coughed blood. The **Great Demon of flames** was *injured*.\n\n\"A human... a mere *human* hurt me?\" Belial's voice shook with disbelief.\n\nOne of the demon's arms had been completely destroyed by the mortar's impact. If she hadn't attempted to dodge, the damage would have been catastrophic. Blindsided by a mortal's technique! Her chariot of black iron lay in twisted ruins.\n\n*Yiiip... yip...* The six three-headed hellhounds that pulled her chariot whimpered as they died, their regeneration unable to keep pace with their injuries.\n\n\"You *dare*...? YOU DARE?!\" \n\nBelial's furious gaze fixed on a middle-aged man standing calmly among the Overgeared forces. He held a hand plow in one hand and a sickle in the other—farmer's tools, worn and simple. He smiled at his companions, at Lauel and the others, with the peaceful expression of a man at perfect peace with his choice.\n\n\"I'll buy you time. All of you—retreat.\"\n\nThe Overgeared members understood instantly. \n\nPiaro was prepared to die."
