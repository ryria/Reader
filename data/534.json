  "content": "\"Yes!\"\n\nThe moment the Red Phoenix Bow materialized in his hands, Grid's composure shattered completely. Pride be damned—pure, unfiltered joy surged through him.\n\n\"Ha! Yes! Jackpot!\" He pumped his fist in the air, grinning like an idiot.\n\n\"...?\"\n\nWhite blinked in confusion. For eight solid hours, he'd watched this mysterious blacksmith work with focused, almost reverent intensity. The dignified craftsman who'd commanded the furnace with such precision now bounced on his heels like an overexcited puppy.\n\n*Did he hit his head on the anvil when I wasn't looking?*\n\nThe truth was simpler—and more authentic. This *was* Grid. The focused artisan and the jubilant fool were two sides of the same coin. And right now, that coin had landed on legendary.\n\n> **[A <span class=\"legendary\">legendary</span> rated item was produced, so all stats have permanently risen by +10 and reputation throughout the continent has risen by +500.]**\n>\n> **[There is a beneficial effect from producing the highest quality. The **Good Luck** stat has increased by 5.]**\n\nHis second legendary item, following the white phosphorus axe. Grid stared at the notification window, then at his stat screen where **Good Luck** now read **31**. His eyes actually stung.\n\n*I did it. I actually overcame my cursed luck.*\n\nThe road to this moment had been brutal. Idan's cooking buffs had felt like a dice roll every meal. God's Command, his so-called \"passive,\" activated about as reliably as a broken clock. But then the golden walnuts had fallen into his lap—literally free—and now this. Balance restored. The universe evening its accounts.\n\n*Is this what the good luck stat actually does?*\n\nThere was no other explanation that made sense.\n\nHis moment of triumph was interrupted by another notification.\n\n> **[The completed item's rating is too high. Item Upgrade isn't applicable.]**\n\nGrid's smile faltered.\n\nItem Upgrade—the skill he'd unlocked upon forging his twentieth legendary creation—was powerful insurance. Within five minutes of completion, he could elevate any item he'd crafted by one full rating tier. He had twenty-four uses stockpiled, gaining three more each time his Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship leveled up.\n\nBut it had limits.\n\n*If only I could use it on older items,* he thought wistfully. The God Hands would become absolutely monstrous as legendary-tier weapons. His attack power would skyrocket overnight.\n\nHe briefly entertained the notion of melting them down and reforging them from scratch. With his current skill, there was a decent chance they'd emerge as legendary... and if not, Item Upgrade would seal the deal.\n\nBut no. Too risky.\n\n*They're growth-type items. Better to let them evolve naturally.*\n\nBesides, those twenty-four uses might be precious down the line.\n\nThe real disappointment, though?\n\n*I can't push a legendary item to myth rating.*\n\nHe'd hoped—foolishly, perhaps—that Item Upgrade might elevate the Red Phoenix Bow beyond legendary. But the skill capped at legendary, and he couldn't tell if that was the skill's limitation or the bow's.\n\n*Maybe the Four Guardians' battle gear isn't quite on par with the Rebecca Church's divine artifacts after all.*\n\n\"WAAAAAAAAH!\"\n\nThe crowd's roar yanked him from his musings. The host was announcing the competition's end, and the Red Phoenix Bow's full specifications materialized before Grid's eyes.\n\n---\n\n> **[Red Phoenix Bow (Reproduction)]**\n>\n> **Rating:** <span class=\"legendary\">Legendary</span>\n>\n> **Durability:** 901/901 | **Attack Power:** 2,360\n>\n> * **60% increase in firing speed.**\n> * **Accuracy will increase by 20%.**\n> * **Contains penetrative damage that ignores the defense of the target's armor.**\n> * **Every time an arrow is shot or every time the bow is raised, flames will be generated. The flames will deal a fixed 4,000 damage to the enemy and cause a 'Burned' state.**\n> * **The skill 'Fly Up!' will be generated.**\n>\n> *The Red Phoenix Bow interpreted by the legendary blacksmith Grid, whose techniques are blossoming.*\n>\n> *It is made of the sturdy white phosphorus tree, but the addition of the minotaur horn and tendons has added elasticity. It can shoot further, stronger, and faster, and also has a strong fire power. It has the ideal shape of a bow, so the performance is far superior to the original Red Phoenix Bow.*\n>\n> *However, the disadvantage is that it is very difficult to use. In addition, because the power of the Red Phoenix guardian is excluded, the overall ability is lower than the original Red Phoenix Bow.*\n>\n> * *This is a bow worthy of the power of the Red Phoenix guardian.*\n>\n> **Conditions of Use:** Master level Advanced Bow Mastery\n>\n> **Weight:** 1,200\n\n---\n\nGrid sucked in a sharp breath.\n\nRanged weapons—bows, crossbows, even greatswords—typically suffered from damage variance. Unlike the stable, predictable strikes of a one-handed blade, they dealt damage in wild ranges. You could land a devastating critical one moment and a pathetic glancing blow the next.\n\nFor someone with Grid's historically abysmal luck, that randomness was a nightmare. Most players celebrated the \"high ceiling\" of big weapons. Grid lived in constant fear of their low floor.\n\nBut this? \n\nFixed damage. **2,360**, every single shot. No variance, no dice rolls. Just raw, consistent power—and it was *higher* than most one-handed weapons.\n\nOn top of that, the bow boasted enhanced firing speed and accuracy, plus an automatic **4,000 fire damage** proc with every attack. It was everything Grid envisioned in a perfect weapon.\n\n*And it's better than the original.*\n\nThe description was clear: *this is a bow worthy of the power of the Red Phoenix guardian.* If the Red Phoenix's energy were infused into *Grid's* reproduction, it would surpass the original by a massive margin.\n\n*So the original Four Guardians' battle gear really is on par with divine artifacts,* Grid realized. This reproduction was legendary without the guardian's blessing. Add that divine spark, and it might evolve into myth-tier.\n\n*But how do I get the Red Phoenix's energy?*\n\nThe question hovered in his mind for all of two seconds before he dismissed it with a grin.\n\n*I'll figure it out later.*\n\n\"Red Phoenix...! Red Phoenix... Bow!\"\n\nA figure vaulted onto the stage—Han Seokbong, Lord of Pangea himself. He swept past the offerings from Blue Flames, Black Anvil, and Red Tongs without so much as a glance, making a beeline straight for Grid.\n\n\"You are... no, *who* are you?\" Han Seokbong's eyes shone with fervent admiration.\n\nThe quest completion notification flashed in Grid's peripheral vision. Victory secured. He chose his words carefully, weighing how to maximize affinity with both the lord and White.\n\n\"Just a blacksmith passing through,\" Grid said humbly. \"I was visiting Pangea and found myself impressed by White's skill. I decided to lend a hand for a short while.\"\n\nThe effect was immediate.\n\n\"Ohh...! White's excellence has drawn such a distinguished artisan to Pangea!\" Han Seokbong beamed.\n\n\"Grid!\" White's voice cracked with emotion.\n\nBut before the celebration could fully bloom—\n\n\"I can't accept this!\" \n\nEnoch, master of the Blue Flames smithy and last year's champion, jabbed an accusatory finger toward the stage. His face flushed crimson. \"Strictly speaking, this man is *not* a member of the White Hammer smithy! By the rules, this competition should be declared void!\"\n\nGrid and White both tensed, but Han Seokbong cut through the protest like a blade.\n\n\"My sole desire was the restoration of the Red Phoenix Bow—and it has been achieved!\" The lord's voice rang with authority. \"Furthermore, this result was only possible through White's skill and virtue. There is no denying it. The White Hammer smithy has won!\"\n\nEnoch's jaw clamped shut. Grid and White exhaled in unison.\n\n> **[The quest 'Win the Smithy Competition!' has been completed.]**\n>\n> **[The affinity with White, the master of the White Hammer smithy, has reached the maximum! White will never cause you any trouble!]**\n>\n> **[In the future, all items at the White Hammer smithy are available for purchase at cost price!]**\n>\n> **[If you sell items at the White Hammer smithy, you can sell them at 20% higher than the market price!]**\n>\n> **[All facilities in the White Hammer smithy will be freely available!]**\n>\n> **[Due to the effect of the Blacksmith's Affection skill, White's blacksmithing skill level has risen by 3!]**\n>\n> **[White's blacksmithing skill has reached advanced level 8.]**\n>\n> **[The affinity with Pangea's lord, Han Seokbong, has increased by 80! Unless you make a big mistake, Han Seokbong will infinitely favor you!]**\n>\n> **[You have gained access to Pangea Castle's dungeon!]**\n>\n> **[Your level has risen.]**\n>\n> **[Follow Han Seokbong. You can get a reward.]**\n\nHan Seokbong turned back to Grid, expression solemn. \"May I ask the name of this distinguished artisan?\"\n\nGrid understood the weight of the moment. If the Red Phoenix Bow had remained lost, both Han Seokbong and the Cho Kingdom would have faced dire consequences. The lord regarded him as a savior—a relationship worth cultivating.\n\n\"Grid,\" he replied simply.\n\n\"Grid...\" Han Seokbong repeated the name like a prayer, committing it to memory. After a long pause, he gestured toward the palace. \"Well then, let us proceed to my castle. There is much to discuss. Ah—\" He extended his hand. \"Please, hand over the Red Phoenix Bow.\"\n\n*\"What?\"*\n\nGrid's brain short-circuited. Every muscle in his body locked up as a single, primal urge clawed its way up his throat.\n\n*Are you KIDDING me?*"
