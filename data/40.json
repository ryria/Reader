Euphemina had already finished forging her blade and moved on to crafting the hilt. I hadn't even completed the outline of my blade. \n\nThe hammer rose and fell. Metal rang against metal.\n\nKhan gripped the tongs, pinching the glowing iron steady. With his support, I could focus entirely on the strikes. Each blow had to count. Every angle mattered.\n\n> **[The Legendary Blacksmith's Patience skill has been activated. Concentration, stamina, and defense will rise to the extremes for one hour.]**\n\nThe notification appeared as I entered a deeper rhythm. Something shifted. My hammer strikes gained weight, precision sharpening with each impact. The metal sang a clearer note under my hands.\n\n*Kaaang!*\n\nThe roar of the crowd faded to nothing. Winston's Central Square, packed with thousands, ceased to exist. Even Khan's presence at my side blurred into the background. Silence wrapped around me like a shroud. \n\nNothing remained but the iron.\n\n*Ttaang. Ttang.*\n\nThe hammer became an extension of my arm. No resistance. No separation. It moved with my intent, a part of my body shaped into tool and purpose.\n\n*Ttaaang!*\n\nThe metal cried out, taking form beneath my strikes. The blade's edge emerged, clean and true.\n\n> **[The Legendary Blacksmith's Breath has increased the effectiveness of your production items.]**\n\nMy focus shattered.\n\n\"Erina! Erina! Erina!\"\n\n\"Khan, keep fighting!\"\n\n\"I believe in Grid!\"\n\nSound crashed over me. The crowd's cheering, birds chirping along the fence, the clock tower's second hand ticking, Euphemina's hammer ringing from across the stage. All of it rushed back at once.\n\nI blinked against the sudden assault of sensation.\n\n*I wanted to stay there longer.*\n\nRegret settled in my chest. Since creating the Special Jaffa Arrows, I hadn't experienced that depth of immersion. A few more minutes in that state of perfect focus, and I could have created something even greater.\n\nKhan's voice broke through my thoughts, trembling with emotion. \"I never thought iron could be so beautiful...\"\n\nI looked down at the blade. Flawless. Every line sharp and deliberate, more beautiful than any artwork I'd seen. My blacksmith's eye recognized it instantly.\n\n*This is better than the Special Jaffa Arrows.*\n\n\"Amazing! Incredible!\" Khan's excitement nearly overwhelmed him. \"To think I helped create this! I was born to be a blacksmith just for this moment!\"\n\nI kept my expression neutral. The blade was finished, but one mistake in the remaining steps would ruin everything.\n\n\"Inventory.\"\n\nI pulled out a minotaur horn. Ten gold well spent before the match. The horn would become both sheath and hilt. A sheath could serve as a defensive tool if the situation demanded it, so proper weight and rigidity mattered. The hilt needed to be softer, reducing fatigue during extended use.\n\nMinotaur horn was perfect. Robust like iron, yet surprisingly yielding, with a texture similar to brass. Durable enough for protection, soft enough for comfort.\n\nI worked quickly, designing the sheath based on the blade's dimensions, shaping the hilt to fit an adult male's hand. Pure function over form. The horn's natural patterns provided artistry without additional effort.\n\nA tremendous roar erupted from the crowd.\n\nEuphemina had finished first.\n\nThe host examined her dagger, his voice carrying across the square. \"This is truly exceptional! To create this in under three hours... I can only marvel at such craftsmanship! Now!\"\n\n\"What did she make?\"\n\n\"Don't keep it to yourself! Show us!\"\n\nThe crowd's curiosity reached a fever pitch. The host let it build before gesturing dramatically toward the display board at the back of the stage.\n\n\"Behold!\"\n\nThe image of Euphemina's dagger materialized on the board. Sharp, balanced, deadly. The blade promised exceptional attack power. The handle featured intricate brass casting with elaborate engravings, transforming the weapon into art.\n\n\"Incredible!\"\n\n\"It's as beautiful as she is! I've never seen a dagger like that!\"\n\n\"Forget aesthetics. Look at that edge. I need that weapon.\"\n\nThe crowd's enthusiasm spread like wildfire. Men and women alike praised Euphemina's work. The dagger's details appeared beneath the image:\n\n> <span class=\"rarity-epic\">Dagger of Bewitchment</span>\n> \n> **Rating:** Epic  \n> **Durability:** 60/60  \n> **Attack Power:** 122~127  \n> **Attack Speed:** +8%\n> \n> * Certain probability of bewitching the enemy\n> * Durability consumed rapidly when blocking attacks\n> \n> *A dagger forged with delicate skill and superior aesthetics by an excellent blacksmith. Its lethal beauty can steal hearts. The razor-sharp blade boasts high attack power, though it lacks robustness.*\n> \n> **User Restriction:** Level 100+, 200+ Agility, 30+ Strength, Intermediate Dagger Mastery\n\nLow durability, but exceptional otherwise. The attack power far exceeded standard daggers. The bewitchment option alone made it deadly. Three seconds of an opponent rendered non-resistant could decide a fight. A perfect assassin's weapon.\n\nUsers in the crowd began calling out their verdict.\n\n\"It's over! Erina definitely won!\"\n\nEven Winston's residents sounded defeated.\n\n\"That woman is a master blacksmith. Grid has Khan's endorsement, but how can he possibly create something better?\"\n\nRabbit and the other Mero Company officials wore smug expressions. Victory seemed assured.\n\nI didn't waver. Neither did Khan.\n\nKhan chuckled. \"Impressive skill for someone so young. Let them celebrate.\" He watched me combine the sheath and hilt with the blade. \"It won't last. Isn't that right?\"\n\nI tested the weight, checking the balance one final time. Perfect.\n\n\"Of course.\" I nodded. \"I represent the ugly people of the world. I never stop.\"\n\nKhan's brow furrowed. \"Represent the ugly people? What nonsense is that? You're fighting for the smithy!\"\n\nHeat crept up my neck. \"Right. Sorry. I forgot.\" I lifted the completed dagger. \"Now, shall we go save the smithy?\"\n\nThe weapon's information scrolled across my vision. My pulse quickened. I turned to present it to the host.\n\nThe host barely glanced at my dagger before addressing the crowd. \"This team took far longer than Erina, despite having two people working together. The outcome is obvious!\"\n\n\"Exactly! Two men against one woman, and they still lost! Shameful!\"\n\nLaughter rippled through the stands.\n\nI met the host's eyes. \"Look at my work first. Carefully. I'd hate for anyone to collapse from shock.\"\n\nArmed soldiers swarmed the stage. Swords and spears glinted in the sunlight as they surrounded me.\n\nOne of them seized my dagger.\n\n\"What the hell?\"\n\nA heavily armored knight stepped forward, his voice carrying authority. \"We have information that you're associated with a criminal named Huroi, arrested eight days ago for attempting to harm Winston. You'll be questioned regarding this matter.\"\n\n\"Huroi?\" \n\n*The guy from the 'For the Residents of Winston' quest? He was arrested? He failed?*\n\nMy jaw clenched. *That useless bastard. Wait... why am I being dragged into this?*\n\nI tried to pull away from the soldiers. \"What are you talking about? I don't know anyone by that name! Let me go!\"\n\nThe knight drew his sword in one smooth motion, the blade stopping inches from my throat. \"I suggest you don't resist.\"\n\nThe steel was cold and very real. I raised my hands slowly.\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nMurder wasn't off the table for this bastard. Unarmed, surrounded, with a blade at my neck, I had no choice. The soldiers grabbed my arms and hauled me off the stage.\n\nKhan's voice rose above the confusion. \"What is this? Why are you arresting an innocent man?\"\n\nThe knights and soldiers ignored him completely.\n\nKhan broke away, rushing toward the section where the Mero Company officials sat. He pointed at the middle-aged man in expensive robes.\n\n\"Valmont! You coward! You knew you'd lose, so you're ending it this way instead! You're not afraid of what Winston's residents will think?\"\n\nValmont's expression remained placid, as though listening to a dog bark in the distance.\n\nThe soldiers dragged me toward the castle.\n\n***\n\n*This is impossible!*\n\nRabbit had spent twenty years as a merchant. In that time, he'd handled countless excellent products. His eye for quality was unmatched.\n\nThe moment he saw Grid's dagger, his blood ran cold.\n\n*That's no ordinary item. Erina's dagger doesn't even compare. We lost. I didn't expect him to possess this level of skill.*\n\nValmont sat beside him, his voice tight with barely controlled anger. \"We lost.\"\n\nHe'd recognized it too, the instant Grid's dagger appeared. Valmont's eye for spectacular items matched Rabbit's own.\n\nRabbit bowed his head. \"I apologize. I should have been more vigilant.\"\n\nValmont's fury cooled to something calculated. \"It's not your fault. You hired a skilled blacksmith. The opponent simply proved stronger than anticipated.\" He paused, studying the stage. \"Different from his appearance.\"\n\nWhen Valmont first laid eyes on Grid, he'd dismissed him as a lowly blacksmith. The man looked like trash. Easy to underestimate. But the results were undeniable. Grid was exceptional.\n\n\"He disguised himself as incompetent to make his opponents lower their guard. Clever. Very clever.\" Valmont's lips curved into something predatory. \"This competition needs to be handled properly. I won't accept this result.\"\n\nThe smithy was his. A merchant didn't surrender profit because of a game.\n\nRabbit leaned closer, concern creasing his features. \"But we announced this publicly. If we don't honor the outcome, the backlash from the residents will be severe.\"\n\nValmont's voice rose. \"Don't speak nonsense. I will never surrender that smithy!\"\n\nRabbit fell silent. Valmont's confidence in such a dire situation meant only one thing.\n\n*He already has a plan.*\n\nValmont's wicked smile confirmed it. \"The crowd doesn't know the result yet. Unlike us, they lack the discerning eye to recognize a masterpiece. Without seeing the item's details, they can't know Grid's dagger far surpasses Erina's work.\" He turned his head slightly. \"Sir Philipson!\"\n\nPhilipson was a knight serving Baron Lowe, Winston's lord. His presence here as Valmont's escort revealed everything about the merchant's current power in the city.\n\nValmont's order came without hesitation. \"Arrest him immediately. Charge him as an accomplice of Huroi, who was recently captured. Confiscate the dagger he created. Under no circumstances can that weapon's information be disclosed to the public.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nPhilipson's soldiers invaded the stage. They moved with practiced efficiency, seizing the dagger and dragging Grid away before anyone could react.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary Link:** [Previous translation notes omitted for clarity]\n\n**Current Schedule:** 20 chapters per week"
