  "content": "**Chapter [X]: The Weight of Reconciliation**\n\nBasara's first act as Empress was to confess the Empire's sins. Only through acknowledgment could they forge a new path. \n\nShe could have hidden behind excuses—*that was the old empire, not mine. Those crimes were committed by rulers long dead.* Such justifications would be convenient. Easy. But if she shirked responsibility for the atrocities of her predecessors, who would heal the victims' wounds? Who would ease the suffering that had scarred entire bloodlines? How could she speak of unity with those her nation had broken?\n\nFor the sake of the continent's future, Basara accepted the full burden of the past.\n\n\"It can't be...\"\n\nThe Sword Knights stood frozen, eyes wide with disbelief. Among the figures clad in weathered red armor stood three living legends: a woman whose face bore three diagonal scars, a short man missing his left ear, and an elderly warrior with mismatched eyes.\n\nAmelda. Kentrick. Dante.\n\nThe single-digit knights who had led the Empire's golden age alongside Piaro. Heroes who inspired every warrior in the realm.\n\n\"Thank you... Thank you, Goddess of Light...\"\n\nOne by one, the knights dropped to their knees. Trembling hands clasped in prayer. Empress Basara's revelation had vindicated them—Piaro and the Red Knights were never traitors. They had always been heroes.\n\n\"Sir Amelda! Sir Kentrick! Sir Dante!\" The knights' voices rang out in unison. \"It is an honor to see you again!\"\n\nTears streamed down weathered faces. These heroes had been branded traitors, hunted by the nation they'd sworn to protect, forced to watch their families slaughtered. The Sword Knights could barely fathom the rage, the grief, the bottomless hatred that must have consumed them through the long years of exile. Yet even knowing this, they wept—not just for the injustice, but in gratitude that these warriors had survived. They prayed that somehow, impossibly, these wounded souls might find even a fragment of peace.\n\nAmelda's laughter was sharp, almost manic. \"What the hell? Is this actually real? We're just... cleared? Just like that?\"\n\nKentrick's voice was hollow. \"The same people who hunted us like animals a few years ago are now bowing in our honor.\"\n\nDante said nothing.\n\nNone of them welcomed this vindication. If anything, it felt like a cruel joke. What good were restored names when everything they'd loved was ash? Their families were dead. Their comrades, gone. All that remained was the bitter fuel of vengeance. Watching these knights kneel stirred nothing but the urge to draw steel and carve retribution from Imperial flesh.\n\n\"Calm yourself.\" Mercedes's hand caught Amelda's wrist before it could reach her sword. The First Knight's eyes swept the scene, pieces clicking into place.\n\n*Empress Basara apologized to every nation the Empire had wronged. The treasury is empty. Conservative nobles abandoned her for Dulandal. And Dulandal, seeking leverage for his bid at the throne, sicced Kyle on the elves to use them as bargaining chips.*\n\nMercedes had spent years in the Imperial court. She knew Basara's idealism and Dulandal's ruthless pragmatism. The political calculus was transparent.\n\n*We're going to fight.*\n\nHer liege—Grid—had shed blood protecting these elves. As his knight, that made their defense her sacred duty.\n\nMercedes studied Kyle. Among the Five Pillars, he'd been Emperor Juander's favorite. Considered the weakest of the five, perhaps, but his potential was undeniable.\n\n*He'll be far stronger than before. I'll need to be careful.*\n\nTechnically, the Empire and Overgeared Kingdom were allies. But their alliance was with Empress Basara, not Prince Dulandal. Fighting his agents wouldn't constitute a diplomatic incident. As Mercedes finished her calculations—\n\n\"Drop that condescending tone.\" Kyle's voice cut through the tension. He'd been watching as carefully as Mercedes, reading the same currents. \"You still see me as a child when *you've* spent a decade rotting away.\"\n\nHis expression was stone as he faced Asmophel, electricity crackling around his frame.\n\nAsmophel smiled sadly. \"I've never looked down on you. I was simply... proud. You've grown into a fine warrior.\"\n\n\"Hehe, he's right!\" Amelda chimed in. \"Little Kyle was such a shrimp compared to everyone else. Now look at you, all grown up! But wait—\" She tilted her head mockingly. \"Weren't you the model student? Always so polite and respectful? What's with this attitude? Did you finally hit puberty?\"\n\n\"*That's* treating me like a child.\" Kyle's jaw tightened. \"You haven't changed at all, Amelda. Aren't you embarrassed, using baby talk at your age? Or did you take one too many head injuries while playing fugitive?\"\n\n\"What?! I'm in my thirties! My *thirties!* I'm not some grandmother!\"\n\n\"Kuk...! Kukukuk!\" Kyle's laughter erupted suddenly—at himself, at his own nervousness. \n\nHe'd been dwelling on the past. Asmophel, the former deputy commander. Amelda, the Fifth Knight. Kentrick, the Seventh. Dante, the Ninth. Years ago, they'd stood at the Emperor's side like untouchable gods while Kyle couldn't even meet their eyes.\n\nBut that was fifteen years ago. Asmophel had been poisoned and enchanted, broken by manipulation. The other three had spent over a decade running, hunted, starved, mentally and physically exhausted. It would be stranger if they *hadn't* lost their edge.\n\nAnd even if they'd somehow regained their prime—even surpassed it—so what? Kyle had also grown. He'd worked himself to the bone to become a Pillar, transcending the rank of Red Knight entirely. And recently, he'd been chosen by the War God himself.\n\nKyle had stepped into the realm of transcendence. Among the uninvited guests, only the Legendary Knight Mercedes warranted caution. And even she hadn't fully matured into her legend yet. There was no reason to be tense.\n\n\"Asmophel.\" Kyle's laughter faded into a cold smile. \"You know, I always thought you were terrible. Calling me 'Electric Eel.' Betraying Piaro out of pathetic jealousy. But I never realized you could be so *shameless.* Bringing your old comrades here—the ones branded traitors, who lost their families *because of you.* I wouldn't have the gall to face them again, no matter how sorry I was.\"\n\nKyle had hated Asmophel once. Back when he'd been new to the palace, terrified and awkward, flinching at every glance. He'd wave his hands nervously whenever someone looked at him, sparks flying from his fingertips. That's when they'd started calling him Electric Eel. Kyle remembered every mocking laugh. He'd wanted revenge for years.\n\nSo now, instead of killing the man blocking his path, he chose to twist the knife.\n\nAsmophel's response wasn't what he expected. No anger. No shame. Just that same bitter smile.\n\n\"I sought them out to take responsibility for my sins. I was obligated to face them. As for how I treated you back then—\"\n\nLightning struck.\n\nAsmophel's eyes sharpened as he leaped aside, the bolt cratering the spot where he'd stood a heartbeat before.\n\n\"Sour.\" Kyle lowered his hand, electricity dancing between his fingers. \"Now choose. Leave, or die by my hand.\"\n\nThe answer came without hesitation. \"This land is under King Grid's protection. I will neither leave nor die.\"\n\n\"Then try to survive.\"\n\nKyle released the floodgates. Electric current erupted in a massive wave—the same large-scale magic that had paralyzed the elves. Electricity was his innate attribute, the power he'd feared as a child. Not anymore. Through Juander's guidance, his own relentless training, and War God Zeratul's blessing, he'd achieved perfect mastery.\n\n**[Physical defense is impossible.]**\n\n**[You have suffered 15,900 damage.]**\n\n**[Paralyzed for 5 seconds.]**\n\n\"Ugh...!\"\n\nThe current ravaged everyone Kyle identified as an enemy—Mercedes, Asmophel, Amelda, Kentrick, Dante, Resh, and all the elves. Resh convulsed as electricity punched through his raised shield. His trembling gaze found Mercedes.\n\nShe stood untouched. Sword energy whirled around her group, deflecting the electric assault.\n\n\"Using such weak attacks against us?\" Kentrick's fury was ice-cold. \"He really does see us as obsolete.\"\n\nAmelda's cheeks puffed out indignantly. \"Right?! After everything we've survived!\"\n\nDante spoke for the first time, his voice quiet steel. \"Don't mock the adversity we've endured.\"\n\nResh's eyes widened in shock.\n\nThe three knights blurred forward, weapons raised. Amelda—the genius who appeared once in a century—moved with impossible speed and precision, her twin swords stabbing for vital points. Kyle's currents intercepted the blades. Kentrick rushed in from the side, his massive broadsword arcing down. Kyle kicked a stone into the blade's path, deflecting the strike. Dante's mace crashed into Kyle's chest in the same instant.\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nResh and every Sword Knight present lost their breath. The exchange between Kyle and the single-digit knights blurred past human perception. The *crack* of impacts echoed continuously as Kyle retreated, electricity flowing like liquid around him, while the three knights pressed forward in perfect coordination.\n\n*He's monstrously strong,* Amelda thought.\n\n*But he relies entirely on his innate attribute,* Kentrick observed.\n\n*He can't match our decades of life-or-death experience,* Dante concluded.\n\nKyle manipulated the currents like additional limbs, weaving attacks and defenses without any formal martial arts or swordsmanship. Powerful, yes—but predictable. They just needed to cut through the electricity itself.\n\nThree blades wreathed in sword energy carved through the air, shredding Kyle's electric assault like tissue. For a heartbeat, Kyle stood exposed. The knights' weapons thrust forward from three angles, trajectories perfectly synchronized to leave no escape—\n\n\"Bah.\"\n\nKyle bent backward with impossible flexibility, his upper body nearly parallel to the ground. All three strikes cut through empty air. Then Kyle's fist rocketed upward like a released spring, electricity concentrating around his knuckles as it drove into Dante's chest.\n\n*Pop.*\n\nDante coughed blood, his momentum shattered. He fell.\n\n\"Not bad...!\" Amelda's swords flashed toward Kyle's thighs. Currents swirled, launching his small frame into the air. Kentrick's broadsword pursued through the opening—\n\nKyle caught the blade between his palms and stopped it dead.\n\nThe three knights' expressions hardened. Kyle hadn't just developed his attribute. His physical technique was masterful. Of course—he was a follower of the War God.\n\n\"Such a monster...\"\n\nMore skilled than the Imperial Dukes. His talent was so overwhelming it could only be described as \"strongest on the continent.\"\n\n*Nothing has changed.*\n\nResh felt despair crystallize in his chest. The Sword Knights would massacre the elves as planned.\n\n\"Bloom.\"\n\nAsmophel's clear voice rang through the forest. A massive flower bud of transparent crimson sword energy materialized above Kyle's body.\n\nKyle's face went white. Blood poured from his nose and ears.\n\n\"I won't kill you,\" Asmophel stated calmly. His sword moved again. Exquisite flowers of sword energy blossomed across Kyle's body, petals painted in his blood as crimson soaked into the forest floor."
