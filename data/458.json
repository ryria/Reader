A 250 increase in stamina held tremendous value. <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Tiramet's Belt</span> was now a coveted item for everyone, regardless of class. If he could raise it to legendary, he could even summon Tiramet. A powerful monster that even Grid found hard to raid.\n\nHis jaw tightened. *But...*\n\nOne thing gnawed at him. The 'Tiramet's Power' attached to the Rune of Darkness hadn't triggered.\n\n> **[Tiramet's Power]**\n> If your health drops below 10%, 30% health will be restored in an instant.\n> **Cooldown Time:** 12 hours.\n\nGrid had counted on this recovery skill. He'd always thought of it as solid insurance, something that could overturn an unfavorable battlefield in an instant. But it never activated in the critical moments. Not once. The same thing happened when he met Lantier in the Behen Archipelago.\n\nHis fists clenched. It felt like dealing with an insurance company that sucked down huge monthly payments and vanished the moment you filed a claim. A scam. The old Grid would've suspected a bug or manipulation. But Grid had changed. There was a reason for everything.\n\n*When I met Lantier, the immortal passive activated.* His brow furrowed. *The immortal passive triggers when I'm about to die. That must be why Tiramet's Power doesn't work.*\n\nIn other words, Tiramet's Power failed to restore his health because he was already technically dead. To benefit from it, his health needed to fall below 10% without triggering the immortal passive. A narrow window.\n\nGrid exhaled slowly. \"Comet Group.\"\n\nHe turned to face the camera directly, injecting the product placement with perfect timing. The model of broadcasting promotion. Damian logged out to thunderous applause and cheers, then approached Grid with a wide smile.\n\n\"I have learned well, Grid. You are my eternal idol.\"\n\nGrid shook his head. \"Don't exaggerate. The difference between our skills is paper-thin.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nDamian knew the truth. Grid hadn't used all his power. If Grid had deployed Pagma's Swordsmanship, Restraint, the match would've ended much faster. But Grid held back.\n\n*It's to maintain my pride.* Damian's chest swelled with emotion. *If a pope is defeated too easily, my reputation will plummet.*\n\nDamian interpreted it freely, thrilled by Grid's consideration. In reality, Grid simply wanted to farm more item experience. Besides, high rankers possessed high levels, stats, and recovery ability. Their accessories increased resistance to status conditions. Damian shook off most debuffs in one to three seconds. Restraint wasn't absolute against such opponents.\n\n\"I want the pope's term to end quickly so I can serve you.\"\n\nDamian's plan was simple: free Rebecca's Daughters during his term, then relocate to Reidan with Isabel. But Grid had other ideas.\n\n\"No. If you really want to follow me, you shouldn't retire.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Maybe I'll never retire from being pope?* Damian's expression grew troubled.\n\n***\n\n『 The fourth round is finally here. The end of the long National Competition is approaching. 』\n\n『 Viewers, please stay on this channel until the last minute. 』\n\nThe broadcasters begged in vain. More viewers worldwide had already migrated to OGC's channel, fascinated by Peak Sword's biased yet precise commentary.\n\n\"Why don't you become a commentator?\"\n\nThe question came from the OGC director himself. He leaned forward excitedly, eyes gleaming after witnessing the viewer count surge past 100 million.\n\n\"I'll accept occasional invitations, but I'm a Satisfy player first.\" Peak Sword straightened in his seat.\n\n\"Haha, indeed. You are one of the heroes who represent South Korea.\"\n\n\"...What hero?\"\n\nPeak Sword's face fell. The dejection was natural. Ranked 15th on the unified rankings and one of South Korea's strongest, yet he'd earned the nickname 'Useless Peak Sword.' The frustration burned. He couldn't win a medal.\n\n*Let's go into mining like Grid suggested.* Peak Sword seriously considered the career change as the fourth round began.\n\nThe matches proceeded rapidly. Kraugel claimed the first match. The US representative Skull took the second. Canada's Dean secured the third.\n\n『 Despite PvP damage being reduced by 50%, the matches end instantly. 』\n\n『 High rankers possess overwhelming attack power. Their health, however, has limits. Skills that apply fixed damage or ignore defense render the defense system ineffective. Most matches end quickly because the skill gap is clear. 』\n\n『 The fourth match is starting. 』\n\n『 The Grid versus Pon match everyone expected. 』\n\n『 Peak Sword, who do you think will win? 』\n\nThe viewers anticipated Peak Sword's answer easily.\n\n*Naturally, God Grid will win.*\n\n*His victory is assured.*\n\n*Will he win in three seconds?*\n\nPeak Sword had heavily favored Grid over Damian earlier. He'd practically coined the buzzword 'God Grid.' But his answer surprised everyone.\n\n『 Pon is very strong. The attack speed of Rail Spear and Mach Spear will challenge even God Grid. If God Grid takes a direct hit from either skill, victory becomes uncertain. 』\n\n『 Hoh... An unexpected answer. Does this mean God Grid will lose? 』\n\nPeak Sword shook his head.\n\n『 No, why would God Grid lose? It will be difficult, but God Grid will win. Do you know God Grid? 』\n\n『 Ah, yes... 』\n\nRight on script. People recognized Peak Sword as someone who would predict Grid's victory even against Kraugel. The fourth match began as the commentators spoke. Whatever the result, it promised excitement. The commentators and viewers brimmed with intense anticipation.\n\nThe match ended shockingly fast. Grid deployed his four God Hands to immediately restrain the legs of Pon's white horse. The mount tilted. Pon's stats plummeted with the loss of his steed, and Grid's power overwhelmed him. A battle tactic that precisely exploited a spear knight's weakness. They needed to be mounted to access their full power.\n\n\"Shit... I could've fought better with a pegasus or soul horse.\" Pon grimaced.\n\nOrdinary horses lacked combat ability. The limitation was brutal. Grid extended a hand to help Pon up.\n\n\"If you buy the <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Diamond Class Capsule</span> from the Comet Group, you receive an egg that hatches random pets daily. Maybe a pegasus will hatch. Ha. Ha. Ha.\"\n\n\"What? Something like that exists? I should buy the <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Diamond Class Capsule</span> from the Comet Group immediately!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nPon fell for textbook capitalism. He maximized Grid's product placement, amplifying the Comet Group's appeal. The corporation received this very positively. Few people in the world remained unaware of the Comet Group now. In South Korea, another conglomerate approached birth alongside the S.A. Group.\n\n***\n\n*Am I actually incredibly strong?*\n\nDean of Canada held a third advancement class. He qualified as a high ranker. He'd worked alongside Chris and Vantner during the National Competition, pushing Canada to fourth in the rankings. But reaching the PvP semi-finals? An unexpected result for Dean, his teammates, and all Canadians.\n\n*At first, I thought it was luck.*\n\nYes, luck explained his progression to the round of 16. He'd avoided the top contenders. But that theory collapsed after reaching the round of 4. Were any PvP participants weak? No. All were high rankers. Even those outside the winning candidate pool sat in the top 0.1%.\n\nCould anyone reach the semi-finals through luck alone? Never. Luck had limits. Skill provided the foundation. Dean understood now.\n\n*I am very strong.*\n\nHis confidence swelled steadily.\n\n*I'm qualified for the finals.*\n\nPublic attention didn't matter. He wasn't a winning candidate in their eyes.\n\n*But I am strong!*\n\nDean climbed onto the stage with that conviction. On the stage, a black-haired man waited. Grid's eyes held the sharpness of a predator. A prodigy who'd defeated multiple winning candidates to reach this point. A monster who'd won four gold medals alone in the National Competition.\n\nBut.\n\n*I am also a monster.*\n\nDean refused to shrink.\n\n*I stand equal to Grid.*\n\nThat's why they shared this stage.\n\n\"Grid.\" Dean's voice rang out. \"From now on, you will be the foundation of my legend.\"\n\n*Is he like Lauel?* Grid studied Dean with mild curiosity.\n\n\"Haaap!\"\n\nThe host announced the match start. Dean swung his rod at Grid instantly. Ten seconds later, a notification window appeared before Dean's eyes.\n\n> **[You have died.]**\n\n\"...\"\n\nHe'd been lucky. Dean grasped the bitter truth as death claimed him.\n\nAll that remained was the final match between Kraugel and Grid."
