  "content": "---\n\n**[Light of Destruction Lv. 1]**\n> *Can only be used against demonkin.*\n> \n> *Attacks the target with 2,070% of your physical attack power and 3,430% of your magic attack power. In addition, there will be overlapping penetration damage according to the number of demonic essences consumed. Penetrates a maximum of five demonkin in a straight line. The damage will be applied equally to all.*\n> \n> *A target hit by the Light of Destruction will temporarily lose their magic.*\n> \n> *Demonic power is the origin of demonkin.*\n> \n> *Once a demonkin loses their unique power, all their stats are reduced by 50% for three minutes and it is impossible to recover health.*\n> \n> *Cooldown: 4 hours (half when used in a hell)*\n> \n> *Mana Consumption: 1,799*\n> \n> *Demonic Essence Consumption: From 5 to 500.*\n\nA Demon Slayer wielded both magic bullets and swordsmanship as their primary tools of destruction. That dual specialization forced Yura to distribute stat points equally between **Strength** and **Intelligence**. With no room to invest in **Agility** or **Stamina**, her attack speed, defense, and evasion rate remained perpetually low. But her skill damage? Devastating.\n\n*If only I had more than 100 demonic essence...*\n\n**Peeeeeong!**\n\nThe jade pillar of light punched clean through Belial's torso, leaving a gaping wound that smoked and crackled. As one of the Demon Slayer's ultimate skills, it proved itself a genuine threat to a great demon.\n\n\"Kuk...! **Kuaaaack!**\"\n\nThe demonic energy that had raged around Belial's body vanished like morning mist under sunlight. Her scream tore through the hellscape—not from physical agony alone, but from the soul-deep violation of having her demonic power stripped away. Piaro and Isabel surged forward, their movements amplified by the most powerful buffs a Goddess' Agent and Pope could provide.\n\n**Chaeeeeeng!**\n\n**Pepepepeng!**\n\nLifael's Spear struck seven times per second. Each stabbing thrust from Isabel drew fresh howls from the great demon.\n\n\"Damn Rebecca's **servant!**\"\n\nEven when Belial managed to deflect the divine artifact, the wounds it carved still burned. Avoidance proved meaningless. Isabel fought in her White Transformation state with full buffs active, while Belial's stats had plummeted by 50%. Dodging became a luxury the great demon could no longer afford.\n\n**Puk!**\n\n**Puooooock!**\n\nPiaro's hand plow tore into Belial's flesh. This—*this*—was true suffering.\n\n\"**Uhh!**\"\n\nTrapped in a vise of excruciating pain, Belial's composure shattered.\n\n\"**Kieeeeeeek!**\"\n\nShe lashed out in fury.\n\n**Dududududung!**\n\nHellfire erupted in a storm—hundreds of flame fists hammering toward Piaro and Isabel.\n\n\"**Kuoong!**\"\n\n\"**Uh...!**\"\n\nBoth defenders raised their guard, bracing for impact.\n\n\"Space Sword.\"\n\nKraugel's voice cut through the chaos like a blade through silk.\n\nThe Sword Saint's ultimate technique severed all space between heaven and earth, carving a wound across Belial's body that transcended mere physical damage. This skill alone justified Kraugel's earlier confidence to Lauel—the reason he believed they could seal Belial. Originally, Kraugel had planned to deploy this devastating blow only after Hao identified Belial's weakness from outside the hell. But Yura's Light of Destruction had already crippled the great demon.\n\nThe opportunity presented itself early. Kraugel seized it.\n\n> [Critical!]\n> \n> [You have dealt **11,300,599** damage to the target.]\n> \n> [The target has suffered irreparable damage! All attributes are reduced by 20% and all speeds are reduced by 50%!]\n> \n> [The target tried to resist. Only half the debuffs are applied.]\n> \n> [The target has exposed their weakness! For 30 seconds, any attacks to the target will unconditionally be a critical hit! Critical damage will be 1.5 times higher!]\n> \n> [The target's resistance has failed.]\n> \n> [**...!**]\n> \n> [**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**]\n> \n> [Your powerful sword has cut the world!]\n\n**Paaaat!**\n\nThe sword energy didn't stop at Belial. It tore through the 32nd Hell's dimensional barrier and erupted into the mortal world. Earth, mountain, sea, and sky—everything in the strike's path split cleanly in half.\n\n> [The power of a Sword Saint has been revealed.]\n> \n> [The peak swordsmanship is fighting against the world.]\n> \n> [The earth's gods have used their power. Everything split in half is restored.]\n\n**\"...!!!\"**\n\n『 **...!!!** 』\n\nThe message blazed across every player's vision screen throughout Satisfy.\n\n**Kurururu!**\n\nThe ground trembled. Across the entire continent, millions of players stared in disbelief.\n\n\"The world...\"\n\n\"It *split apart?*\"\n\n\"Sword Saint!\"\n\n\"**Kraugel!**\"\n\nThe player who had dominated the top rankings since Satisfy's launch—at last, the world understood what hidden class had driven him to step down from his throne.\n\nIn the real world, Youngwoo's eyes widened as he watched the television broadcast.\n\n\"Kraugel!\"\n\nHis allies were growing stronger—Piaro, Yura, all of them ascending to new heights. But while Youngwoo sat on his couch watching television, his greatest rival had just *split the world in half with a sword?*\n\nUnacceptable.\n\n**Puoook!**\n\n\"Brother...\"\n\nSehee noticed her brother's clenched fists and started to worry. But relief washed over her moments later when she saw the smile spreading across Youngwoo's face.\n\n*You found yourself a worthy competitor,* she thought.\n\nThe stronger Kraugel became, the more her brother would push himself to greater heights. She could feel it, somehow—the way rivals forged each other into something more.\n\n***\n\n\"...Ha?\"\n\nBehen Archipelago, 61st island.\n\nA man stood over the fallen form of Lantier—the undead left behind by Pagma, who had been Baal's Contractor. The battle had raged through day and night, and he'd barely managed to knock the death knight down.\n\nAgnus swept back pale green hair matted with sweat. Golden eyes flashed as notification windows materialized before him.\n\n> [The power of a Sword Saint has been revealed.]\n> \n> [The peak swordsmanship is fighting against the world.]\n\n\"Kik... Kikik, the earthquake just now—*he* caused that?\"\n\nThe strongest legendary class. Sword Saint. The identity was obvious.\n\n\"Kraugel.\"\n\nThe rat had vanished from the spotlight, only to return more brilliant than ever. They would meet again soon.\n\nThe anticipation thrilled him.\n\n\"Kik... Kikikik! **Kuahahahat!**\"\n\nInsane laughter echoed across the Behen Archipelago.\n\nBini the fairy's face had gone pale. *Sticks, I'm scared. This human is too dangerous.*\n\n***\n\n\"**Now!**\"\n\nBelial had been weakened by both Light of Destruction and Space Sword in rapid succession. The Overgeared members launched their full offensive. Vantner and Toban marked the succubi alongside Earl Ashur. Regas unleashed the power of an Asura while every damage dealer converged on Belial—Pon charging forward on his white horse, leading the assault.\n\nIbellin distinguished himself above all others. He wielded the Thorn of Deep Grievance that Grid had crafted during the Tzedakah Guild days, and the skill attached to it—Laceration—proved devastating against boss monsters. The fixed damage calculation triggered perfectly.\n\n**WHAM!**\n\nSixty percent of Belial's remaining health vanished in an instant.\n\n> [The 32nd Great Demon Belial has suffered a fatal injury!]\n\n\"**Wow!**\"\n\n\"Ibellin is amazing!\"\n\n\"You dealt more damage than the Sword Saint!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*This is what it means to be truly overgeared,* Kraugel realized with a mixture of shock and admiration. Ibellin had just dealt more burst damage than a Sword Saint's ultimate skill.\n\n**Peng!**\n\n**Pepepepeok!**\n\nFrom the moment of her appearance until now, Jishuka had maintained continuous fire. Kraugel found himself impressed.\n\n*How does she keep shooting without rest? Is her **Stamina** so high she doesn't need to pace herself?*\n\n\"You should join Overgeared as well,\" Jishuka suggested, her voice carrying a playful lure.\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe godly archer answered his unspoken question with a wink and a cheerful expression.\n\n\"Of course, it's my items.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nTruly items. Kraugel grasped the fundamental truth—this was the genuine power that equipment could provide.\n\n*If I joined Overgeared...*\n\nHe would be significantly stronger than his current state. Freedom from Ares' political suppression. Protection from the madman Agnus.\n\n*But I can't be too greedy.*\n\nSome things were destined. Grid was a worthy rival before he was a friend. They could support each other while maintaining the essential competitive landscape. To reach the 'perfect peak,' Kraugel needed to compete with Grid—to use that competition as nutrients for growth.\n\nHe didn't want to join Overgeared.\n\nAnd Grid didn't want him either.\n\n*Besides, if I joined, Overgeared would inherit all of Agnus' aggro.*\n\n**Puuok!**\n\n**Puuoooook!**\n\nKraugel maintained his relentless assault while his thoughts churned. Under the combined onslaught from Kraugel, Piaro, Isabel, and the Overgeared members, Belial's health plummeted to 10%. Ibellin's deadly strike had carved away a massive chunk.\n\n*It will end soon!*\n\n*We're going to be the first players to succeed in a great demon raid!*\n\nWhat moment in Satisfy brought the greatest exhilaration? When Grid crafted them new equipment, or when they worked together to overcome a boss raid. The Overgeared members were already anticipating the titles and items that Belial would drop.\n\nBut a great demon was never easy. Belial might rank as the 32nd great demon, but current players weren't at her level. Without Piaro and Isabel, they never would have driven her this far.\n\n> [The effect of the Light of Destruction has disappeared.]\n> \n> [The 32nd Great Demon Belial's unique attributes and abilities have been restored.]\n> \n> [You are scared by the terrible sight of Belial.]\n> \n> [Resistance to status conditions has dropped by 70%!]\n> \n> [Skill and magic casting time has doubled and attack speed is reduced by 20%...]\n> \n> [Belial is the queen of fire. The flames surrounding her are very hot...]\n> \n> [Resistance to fire is 0%.]\n> \n> [Due to the heat...]\n> \n> [Belial is the queen of darkness. The demonic energy...]\n> \n> [Resistance to dark magic is 0%.]\n> \n> [Use of black magic is blocked.]\n\nManageable. Belial had simply returned to her original state. She still only had 10% health remaining. Both Kraugel and Yura judged they could finish her.\n\nIt was an arrogant judgment.\n\n> [The effect of Hell Regulation is over.]\n> \n> [The environment of the 32nd Hell is restored.]\n> \n> [The 32nd Great Demon Belial has absorbed the magic of hell and revealed the hell monarch's status.]\n\n**Kurururung!**\n\nBelial's form shifted into a lava mass, her demonic energy writhing and expanding. Thunder cracked across the hellscape. When the transformation completed, her new appearance emerged.\n\n\"...\"\n\nBelial's final form resembled the classical devil depicted in ancient tomes. Two large horns crowned her forehead. Her humanoid shape radiated waves of searing heat with each breath.\n\n\"That...\"\n\n\"Is it her *real* appearance?\"\n\nShe gave off no overwhelming pressure. A female demon standing barely 160 centimeters tall. When judged by appearance alone, she seemed almost unthreatening.\n\nBut the Overgeared members' hearts sank.\n\n\"W-What? Her health is **full?**\"\n\nDuring the transformation process, Belial's health had surged from 10% back to 100%. Hours of desperate combat—all for nothing? They would have to start over from the beginning?\n\nSeveral members felt their knees weaken.\n\nBelial's smile widened. She waved one hand.\n\n**Peeeong!**\n\nDemonic energy shot forward like a spear and struck Jishuka square in the chest.\n\n\"**Jishuka!**\"\n\nAs confusion rippled through the raid party, one mind cut through the chaos.\n\n*I've finally found it!*\n\nLauel's extraordinary brain kicked into overdrive."
