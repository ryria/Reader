  "content": "**\"Legendary Blacksmith's Appraisal.\"**\n\nGrid reached into the corner of his inventory and withdrew a single walnut from the leather pouch. He activated his appraisal skill, focusing his enhanced perception on the unassuming nut.\n\n>**[The blacksmith who became a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]**\n\n>**[6th grade illusion magic has been detected.]**\n\n>**[The illusion is useless before your eyes and scatters like a mirage.]**\n\n>**[The information about the walnut has been updated!]**\n\n>**[Golden Walnut]**\n>\n>*Also called the blessing of nature.*\n>\n>*A snack and remedy enjoyed by all nobles and royalty on the East Continent.*\n>\n>***All stats will rise by 10% for one hour.***\n>\n>*In addition, there is a very low probability of permanently increasing one stat by 5 points.*\n>\n>*Weight: 0.1*\n\n>**[You have discovered a hidden feature!]**\n\n>**[Golden Walnut]**\n>\n>*Also called the blessing of nature.*\n>\n>*A snack and remedy enjoyed by all nobles and royalty on the East Continent.*\n>\n>*Somewhere on the East Continent, there are creatures whose main food is this walnut.*\n>\n>***All stats will rise by 10% for one hour.***\n>\n>*In addition, there is a very low probability of permanently increasing one stat by 5 points. The better you shell the walnut, the more likely it is that your stats will permanently increase.*\n>\n>*Weight: 0.1*\n\nGrid's mouth fell open. His hands trembled as the true value of the Golden Walnut registered. A grin spread across his face, and he shook his head slowly.\n\n\"The more I think about it, the poorer they really are.\"\n\nThe Golden Walnuts had been veiled in 6th grade illusion magic. Mook's party probably had no idea what they'd handed over. If they'd known the true value, they never would've considered using them as monster bait.\n\n*They're pitiful pushovers. I should be nice to them,* Grid decided.\n\nHe was projecting his former self onto Mook's party—seeing echoes of his own struggles in their desperation. A great sense of sympathy swelled in his chest as he considered what they must have suffered on the East Continent.\n\n*Who would've thought I'd be so kind to people I met for the first time today? I really am too nice.*\n\nAfter all, if he wasn't a good person, would he sponsor X University 3,300 won a month? Grid genuinely believed in his own magnanimity.\n\n*I'm not good enough to return the walnuts, but I'm still practically an angel.*\n\nPride warming his chest, Grid resisted the urge to consume another Golden Walnut immediately.\n\n*Eat it sparingly. Before it's an elixir, it's the strongest buff potion available.*\n\nMost stat-boosting buffs lasted one to ten minutes at most. The Golden Walnut's effect persisted for a full hour. Moreover, Grid knew of only one other buff potion that raised **all stats**—Sweet Candy, the fraudulent item from the Reputation Store that raised all stats by 30%. Each account could only purchase it five times.\n\n*It's too precious to eat unless I encounter a dragon or something. This walnut is the best buff potion available. Save it for emergencies.*\n\nA dragon—the strongest creatures created by the S.A. Group, entities players couldn't hunt yet. Grid never wanted to encounter one. He planned to avoid them at all costs. But the world was vast and unpredictable. Particularly with Grid's terrible luck, he could easily imagine a scenario where Minerals Detector Minor suddenly declared while searching around Reidan:\n\n\"I have found the best minerals in a dragon's lair!\"\n\n\"Then I definitely can't go there...\"\n\n*Please don't let that happen.*\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\nGrid paused mid-prayer as a thought struck him. Was there a way to secure a large quantity of Golden Walnuts? His expression darkened as he formulated a new plan. Before he knew it, the hour for breakfast was approaching.\n\n*Ah, damn it.*\n\nGrid's physical condition had improved dramatically since he'd started exercising. In Satisfy, maximum stamina would be temporarily lowered if a player didn't eat three meals daily. Skipping meals was inadvisable. But Grid wanted desperately to skip today's meal. His eyes turned dark at the mere thought of eating Idan's cooking.\n\n*No... today will be different.*\n\nHe'd made his preferences perfectly clear yesterday—beef, chicken, and eggs. Ingredients that were delicious even when poorly prepared. Grid was counting on Idan to produce a dish that exceeded dog food quality using these simple components.\n\n*Hurry up. I'll eat, then go watch the competition.*\n\nStill, he felt slightly concerned about Mook's party.\n\n*Well, there's no Queen Rat left in the community anymore.*\n\n**Step.**\n\nGrid turned on his heel and departed for Pangea.\n\n***\n\nDarkness clung to the Big Poisonous Rat community. Dawn began revealing the camp's grand scale in gradual increments. Mook's group felt increasingly disturbed from their hiding spots, motionless as dead mice.\n\n\"This is when the rats wake up,\" Mook whispered.\n\n\"What should we do? We'll be surrounded,\" Lane hissed.\n\n\"What choice do we have? We can't run anymore. We wait.\" Evan's voice was resigned.\n\nFifteen minutes had passed since the masked man left. Any moment now, he should be placing the last walnut before the Queen Rat's tent.\n\n\"One minute. Just wait one more minute,\" Mook breathed.\n\n\"The moment the masked man places the last Golden Walnut before the tent, the Queen Rat will wake up,\" Oshihoz added.\n\n\"All the Big Poisonous Rats will chase after him.\"\n\nThe Big Poisonous Rats had a peculiar trait—they possessed the innate ability to detect when the Queen Rat was endangered, even from considerable distances, and would swarm toward any intruder. Mook's group had planned to escape while the Queen Rat and all the Big Poisonous Rats were chasing Grid. He was meant to be their sacrificial lamb.\n\nHowever...\n\n\"Isn't it strange?\" Lane's brow furrowed.\n\n\"Why is it so quiet?\" Evan strained his ears.\n\nThe expected time had long passed, yet the Big Poisonous Rats remained utterly silent. The health gauge of the masked man displayed in the party window remained full. The Queen Rat hadn't appeared. The masked man hadn't fulfilled his role.\n\n\"No, is he stupid enough to have not placed the walnuts properly?\" Mook's voice rose in panic.\n\n\"Don't tell me... he figured out the value of the Golden Walnuts and ran away?\" Oshihoz's eyes widened.\n\n\"Don't speak such nonsense!\" Lane snapped.\n\n\"It's impossible,\" Evan insisted. \"My illusion magic might only last an hour, but it can block the best appraisal skills. It boasts tremendous sophistication.\"\n\n\"Then what is this situation? Why are the Big Poisonous Rats so quiet?\"\n\nIf the masked man had succeeded in attracting the Queen Rat as scheduled, all the Big Poisonous Rats should've burst from their tents by now. Instead, the rats were deathly silent. Had the masked man noticed their trap and fled? Mook's group envisioned the worst-case scenario and grew increasingly nervous. They began communicating through party chat.\n\n**-Excuse me... Grid?**\n\n**-Where are you?**\n\n**-What happened to the walnuts?**\n\n**-Don't you need to lure the Queen Rat?**\n\nGrid belatedly replied.\n\n**-There is no Queen Rat, so you can move freely. I'm going to get some breakfast. Later.**\n\n>**[Grid has left the party.]**\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nMook's party stood frozen, stunned into silence. They couldn't comprehend Grid's words.\n\n*There is no Queen Rat?*\n\n*He withdrew from the party to eat breakfast?*\n\nFirst of all, the Queen Rat's absence made no sense. She could only be missing if someone had raided her within the past three days. But who? None of the players currently remaining in Pangea possessed the capability to defeat the Queen Rat. Only four players were still stuck in Pangea—Mook's group.\n\nWell, there was the masked man who'd joined them earlier. But it was impossible for him to raid the Queen Rat solo.\n\n*Dammit... what happened to the walnuts?*\n\nIt was exceedingly rare for a player to leave a party to eat food. Most cooked and ate at hunting grounds. Yet this person had withdrawn from the party for breakfast. The situation crystallized with painful clarity.\n\n*We've been tricked!*\n\nComplete devastation. The masked man had deceived them. They'd attempted to stab him in the back, only to be stabbed themselves.\n\n\"That bastard...\" Mook's voice shook with fury. \"He knew our ulterior motives from the beginning!\"\n\nHe'd pretended to be deceived, then acted at the crucial moment to strike them first. Evil and cunning.\n\n\"Shit! Shit!\" Lane kicked the ground.\n\nThey'd been utterly abandoned. The Golden Walnuts they'd spent all their money purchasing had vanished. In a word: ruined. Everyone wallowed in despair until Mook offered a lifeline of hope.\n\n\"Hey, wake up! No matter how clever he is, it's impossible for him to figure out the true identity of the walnuts!\"\n\n\"That's right!\" Evan seized onto the hope. \"He probably thinks the Golden Walnuts are ordinary walnuts and abandoned them somewhere nearby!\"\n\n\"Exactly! We'll search for the Golden Walnuts starting now!\" Mook's determination rekindled. \"We'll get our revenge after retrieving the walnuts!\"\n\n\"Yeah!\"\n\nTheir hope and morale surged—but only for a moment.\n\n\"...By the way, how many walnuts are scattered around this massive community?\" Oshihoz's voice fell.\n\n\"This is when the Big Poisonous Rats are most active... How can we deal with them if they leave their tents in groups? Even weakened, handling so many would be impossible.\"\n\n\"Above all, the biggest problem is the Queen Rat herself. She often wanders between the tents in the morning. We'll die instantly if we encounter her.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nA continuous cycle of despair. What options remained? Mook thought hard and found a single answer.\n\n\"We... we'll hide and wait until their nap time.\"\n\nThey had to remain concealed for ten hours until the rats' nap period. They couldn't move a single finger.\n\n\"Once they go to sleep, we'll start the walnut search operation.\"\n\nBy repeating this pattern, they might find the Golden Walnuts in approximately four days. Mook's group breathed slowly as rats began emerging from tents one by one. Tears glistened in their eyes. It was the day they learned that people shouldn't do bad things.\n\n***\n\n\"Right now, they should've moved on safely to the next hunting ground, right?\"\n\nWho could have known his raid of the Queen Rat would prove such a tremendous help to Mook's party? It was something he'd never considered.\n\n\"This connection is fortuitous... Haha.\"\n\nGrid was pleased to have helped those poor people. He arrived at Pangea, which bustled with festival energy, and removed his mask. Then he froze."
