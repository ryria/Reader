  "content": "Every item in Satisfy had what Grid called an \"understanding value.\" Through observation, use, disassembly, and reassembly, he could gradually push that value toward 100%. Once there, the item's production method would unlock, added to his repertoire like a blueprint stamped into his mind.\n\n\"Item Disassembly.\"\n\nGrid's plan was simple: understand the holy sword first, cleanse it second. The higher his understanding, the clearer the path forward.\n\n'Though getting to 100% might be impossible.'\n\nThis wasn't just any weapon. This was the symbol of Rebecca herself—the Goddess of Light—and the pride of the continent's supreme religion. Among myth-rated items, it stood apart. Then again, all myth items were special. Their performance might vary, but their *significance* was universal. No, the real problem was simpler than that.\n\nThe holy sword was a quest item.\n\n> **[First Holy Sword that is Becoming Petrified]**\n>\n> **Rating:** Myth\n>\n> The first holy sword forged for humanity. Though Pagma's Descendant—Grid—has temporarily freed it from the seal of the Stone of Original Sin, the curse still clings to its edge.\n>\n> The petrification is spreading again.\n\nDuring the Crossroad of Good and Evil quest, the weapon had been labeled simply as \"Sword Stuck in the Stone.\" No attack power. No durability stat. No options. Just a vague description and a name. Yet when Damian had wielded it against Aliburn, the blade had carved through the Yatan Servant like a divine judgment made manifest.\n\n'Quest items,' Grid thought grimly. 'They only function during their designated moments.'\n\nIt made sense from a design perspective. You couldn't mass-produce weapons meant for specific story beats. The system would preserve the sword's symbolic weight by preventing players from fully reverse-engineering it.\n\n'But I can probably get to 99.9%.'\n\nHe wouldn't learn the production method, but he'd understand its hidden properties. Its structure. Its intentions. That would be enough. He'd see where the curse had taken root, and from there—\n\nTtang!\n\nGrid's hammer crashed down on the church's holiest relic without hesitation.\n\nHad any of the Rebecca Church's thousands of faithful witnessed this scene, they would have rioted. But Pope Damian stood silent, watching Grid work with unwavering trust. After all, Grid had disassembled and reassembled Lifael's Spear dozens of times while saving Isabel. If anyone could do this, it was him.\n\nTtang! Ttaaang! Ttatatang—! Ttaang—!\n\nGrid hammered. Prodded. Measured. Threw the sword into the furnace. Pulled it out. Damian didn't so much as flinch.\n\nBut thirty minutes in, a sliver of doubt crept into the Pope's mind.\n\nThe holy sword sat on the anvil, pristine and unchanged.\n\n'...No progress?'\n\n> [You have failed to find the melting point of the material composing the target item.]\n>\n> [Smelting has failed.]\n>\n> [You cannot locate the binding structure of the target item.]\n>\n> [Disassembly has failed.]\n\n\"Pant... pant... What the hell?\"\n\nGrid's hammer blows grew more desperate. His understanding gauge remained locked at 7%. Seven percent. After dozens of attempts, it hadn't budged. Not even a decimal point.\n\n'This makes no sense. I've disassembled myth items before—'\n\nNo. Stop. Focus. Grid forced the frustration down, buried it beneath the only attribute he truly excelled at: **Persistence.**\n\nTen more attempts. Twenty. Thirty. Forty.\n\nIf it didn't work after ten tries, he'd do ten more.\nIf it didn't work after twenty, he'd do twenty more.\nIf it didn't work after—\n\n\"Pant... pant...! Keok!\"\n\nHis arms burned. His vision swam. Blacksmithing was a labor class, and his stamina was bottoming out. A strange, detached thought drifted through his exhausted mind.\n\n'If I collapse here... will I see Khan again?'\n\n\"...id! Grid!\"\n\n\"—Heok!\"\n\nDamian's voice cut through the haze. Grid blinked, realizing his tongue was hanging out like an overheated dog. The Pope stood beside him, worry etched across his face.\n\n\"You need to rest.\"\n\n\"How long... has it been?\"\n\nAn hour? Two? Grid routinely spent days on a single item, so a couple hours of intense focus wasn't—\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nSunlight streamed through the window behind Damian. Bright. Midday bright.\n\n\"It's past noon,\" Damian said gently. \"You've been working for fifteen hours.\"\n\n\"*Fifteen—?*\"\n\nA chill crawled down Grid's spine. He'd entered a trance state—that deep well of concentration where time dissolved. But trances were supposed to yield results. Breakthroughs. Progress.\n\nHis understanding gauge still read 7%.\n\n\"What...\" Grid's voice came out hollow. \"What the hell is wrong with this thing?\"\n\nThe holy sword gleamed on the anvil, mocking him with its perfection.\n\nDamian sighed. \"There's a saying that the holy sword is forged from minerals created by the blacksmith god Hexetia himself. Perhaps... it exists beyond mortal comprehension.\"\n\n\"Hex—what? Who?\"\n\n> [You have learned of the blacksmith god **Hexetia**.]\n>\n> [**Intelligence** has permanently increased by **10**.]\n>\n> [All blacksmithing skill experience increased by **2%**!]\n\nGrid froze.\n\n> [You have identified the creator of the **First Holy Sword that is Becoming Petrified**.]\n>\n> [Your understanding has increased by **5%**!]\n>\n> [You have roughly identified the materials composing the **First Holy Sword that is Becoming Petrified**.]\n>\n> [Your understanding has increased by **7%**!]\n\n\"...Ah.\"\n\nThe sound that escaped Grid's throat was somewhere between a laugh and a groan. Fury and embarrassment warred in his chest as the realization crystallized.\n\nHe smiled. It didn't reach his eyes.\n\n\"Damian. What exactly is the holy sword made from?\"\n\n\"Divine stone,\" the Pope replied, oblivious. \"As I said—a material created by the blacksmith god Hexetia.\"\n\n> [You have obtained information on a **new mineral**!]\n>\n> [The foundation of your blacksmithing knowledge expands!]\n>\n> [You have identified the core material of the **First Holy Sword that is Becoming Petrified**.]\n>\n> [Your understanding has increased by **15%**.]\n\n\"...\"\n\nIt was like kicking off your blanket in the middle of the night, or suddenly remembering an embarrassing moment from five years ago. Grid had forgotten the most basic rule of questing.\n\n*Always get information from the quest giver.*\n\nHe'd spent fifteen hours hammering blindly at a divine artifact when a single conversation would have given him the starting point he needed. Because Damian was a player—not an NPC—Grid had skipped the standard information-gathering dialogue.\n\n\"Hah... Goddammit!\" The curse tore out of him.\n\n'No. Wait. Isn't this Damian's fault? He saw me struggling and didn't say anything—'\n\n\"Don't be discouraged,\" Damian said with an encouraging smile. \"Sometimes our efforts don't bear immediate fruit. Why don't you eat something and rest? We can resume after—\" His stomach growled. \"Ah~~ I'm starving. I hope Isabel didn't eat without me!\"\n\nThe Pope turned toward the door.\n\n\"Stop.\"\n\nGrid's voice was flat. Cold. Damian paused.\n\n\"...Yes?\"\n\n\"Sit down.\" Grid gestured to the stool beside the anvil. His expression could have frozen water. \"You're not going anywhere until this is finished. And you're definitely not eating.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Sit. Down. And tell me everything you know about this sword.\"\n\n\"B-But—\"\n\n\"How can you even *think* about food right now?\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nConfusion flickered across Damian's face. Then—enlightenment.\n\n'He's not angry! He's protecting me!'\n\nOf course! How would it look if the Pope abandoned the holy sword to fill his belly while an outsider labored to save it? The faithful would whisper. His public support would crater. He might even lose his position in next year's election!\n\n'I was so thoughtless...!'\n\nTears welled in Damian's eyes. \"Once again, you save me and teach me humility! Truly... you are a blessing, God Grid-sama!\"\n\n\"What? What are you babbling about?\"\n\n\"Your selflessness...! Kuock! It moves me to my core!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid stared at the weeping Pope. A familiar thought surfaced, one he'd had many times before.\n\n'Why are all the people around me completely insane?'\n\nHe shook his head and turned back to the holy sword. This time, armed with actual information, he thrust it into the furnace.\n\nThe smelting began.\n\nThis time, he wouldn't fail."
