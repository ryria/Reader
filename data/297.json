Group sat in his mansion's sprawling living room—big enough to pass for a private theater. Director Yoon Sangmin occupied the seat to his left, Team Leader Ashley Tosun to his right. All three wore VR glasses, nursing bottles of soju while the wall-sized screen displayed Grid's party navigating the vampire city.\n\n\"Zero.\" Ashley set down his drink. \"The possibility of success is zero.\"\n\n\"Elaborate.\" Yoon Sangmin didn't look away from the screen.\n\n\"Blood Field activates in 1.8 seconds.\" The Team Leader who designed the vampire system leaned forward. \"You need three third advancement healers minimum to offset the drain. Grid's party has none.\"\n\nLim Cheolho smiled around a mouthful of spicy meat. \"You're assuming conventional strategy.\"\n\n\"I'm stating facts.\" Ashley gestured at the screen. \"They sacrificed Huroi. Stupid. He was their aggro management and primary damage buffer.\"\n\n\"They sacrificed Huroi because the alternative was total wipe.\" The chairman wiped his fingers on a napkin. \"And you're forgetting something.\"\n\n\"Which is?\"\n\n\"Grid is Pagma's Descendant.\" Lim Cheolho's eyes gleamed behind the VR display. \"One of five who can cause miracles. His strength exceeds original design parameters by orders of magnitude.\"\n\nYoon Sangmin nodded slowly. \"The rest aren't normal either. Jishuka, Peak Sword, Pon, Regas, Faker, Vantner, Zednos—their control and instincts transcend level calculations.\"\n\nAshley frowned. \"Granted. But Blood Field—\"\n\n\"I agree the odds are poor.\" Yoon Sangmin interrupted. \"I support Grid. I've watched him grow for a year now. My wife doesn't know, but I run his largest fan club.\" He paused. \"That said, even I doubt this raid succeeds.\"\n\nLim Cheolho's lips curved up. His mouth burned from the chili oil.\n\n\"Good. Then my bet pays better.\"\n\nThe three men settled in to watch. This wasn't leisure time. Grid was special—a case study in human potential maximized through Satisfy's systems. Missing this would be criminal negligence.\n\n***\n\n*They're calling her Demon Slayer.*\n\nYura stood near Reidan Castle's resurrection point, arms crossed. The Overgeared members clustered around her, whispering. She caught fragments.\n\n\"Legendary class—\"\n\n\"Gold text, just like Grid—\"\n\n\"Level 203 in four months—\"\n\nLauel approached. \"Impressive growth rate.\"\n\n\"I had advantages.\" Yura watched the resurrection shrine. Empty. \"The know-how from reaching fifth rank. The legendary class boost. Luck.\"\n\n\"Three times faster than typical rankers.\" Lauel studied her. \"That's not just advantages.\"\n\nShe didn't respond. Her attention stayed fixed on the shrine.\n\n*He should appear soon.*\n\nThe briefing had been clear. Eight person party. Impossible boss. Total wipe imminent. Yura's jaw tightened.\n\n*No.*\n\nShe'd followed Grid's story from the beginning. Watched every broadcast, read every article. She understood what separated Youngwoo from other players—not talent or fortune, but the scar tissue from 26 years of failure. He'd learned to see solutions where others saw walls.\n\n*Come back safe.*\n\nHer hands clenched.\n\n*Come back alive.*\n\n***\n\nElfin Stone stretched in his mansion's master bedroom. Twenty-three hours of sleep—the longest he'd allowed himself in decades. His reflection in the gilded mirror showed flawless pale skin, aristocratic features, eyes like rubies.\n\n\"Today requires discipline.\" He adjusted his white tailcoat. \"The cattle are slaughtering my stock.\"\n\nThe familiars had reported everything. Eight humans carving through the city, killing ordinary vampires by the dozen. That didn't bother him. Replaceable resources. But they'd destroyed three True Bloods yesterday.\n\n*Irreplaceable.*\n\nOnly Shizo Beriache and her direct descendants could create True Bloods. Losing them hurt.\n\n\"Two meals today instead of one.\" He studied his reflection. \"Save the black-haired one for last.\"\n\nThe memory of that human's defiance still amused him. *He sold out his companion.* The eventual despair would taste exquisite.\n\nElfin Stone left his mansion. The darkness of the underground city wrapped around him like a cloak.\n\n***\n\n*Which one first?*\n\nEarl Elfin Stone drifted through shadow, invisible, tracking Grid's party by scent. His nose sorted through the bouquet—sweat, metal, human fear.\n\n*Pon. Regas. The strong ones.*\n\nFaker was more dangerous from a technical standpoint. That assassin's shadow techniques bordered on supernatural. But Pon and Regas hit harder, survived longer. Better to remove them early, make the rest of the hunt leisurely.\n\nElfin Stone dissolved into black smoke. The transformation was instantaneous. He became the darkness itself, racing through the air faster than Faker could ever move.\n\n*Above their heads. They never look up.*\n\nHe positioned himself directly over Pon, materialized just enough to cast.\n\n*Now.*\n\n\"Extreme Blood Transfusion!\"\n\nThe spell activated. Blood-red energy lanced downward—\n\n\"I've been waiting.\"\n\n*What?*\n\nGrid stared up at him. The black-haired human was *looking directly at him.*\n\n*Impossible.*\n\nNo human had ever detected his approach. The confusion lasted half a second. Then training took over. *Doesn't matter. The spell's already cast. Pon dies.*\n\nGrid moved.\n\n\"Revolve.\"\n\nThe greatsword came up. The blood curtain *caught* on the blade's edge, twisted—\n\n*No—*\n\nThe spell reversed. Elfin Stone felt his own magic slam into him like a fist made of razors.\n\n\"Heok!\"\n\nHe tried to dissolve, escape into shadow. Golden light pierced his side. A spear. The pain was *impossible*, far beyond what he should feel from human weapons.\n\nThe blood curtain swallowed him. His own spell. The humiliation burned worse than the damage.\n\n\"Cough!\"\n\nElfin Stone hit the ground. Vomited blood. His beautiful face contorted in rage and incomprehension.\n\n\"You!\"\n\nHe surged to his feet. The notification windows spawned around the humans—he felt his passive effects take hold.\n\n> **[The master of the 13th city, Vampire Earl Elfin Stone has appeared.]**\n> \n> **[A strong evil influence is making your magic power turbid. All types of spells and skills aren't available.]**\n> \n> **[A vampire's gaze will subdue lower species. Your body is subjected to a strong oppression.]**\n\nThe Overgeared members froze. Their movements turned sluggish, skills sealing off one by one. Elfin Stone smiled.\n\nThen he looked at Grid.\n\nThe human stood loose and ready. No sluggishness. No sealed skills.\n\n> **[You have resisted.]**\n\n*He resisted?*\n\n\"Blood Field!\"\n\nElfin Stone poured mana into his signature technique. The domain spell that had killed thousands—\n\nGrid closed the distance. Not running. *Blurring*. Faster than Faker, faster than physics should allow.\n\nThe blue greatsword punched through Elfin Stone's sternum.\n\n*What—*\n\nHis mana flow reversed. Blood Field died unborn.\n\n\"My share ends here.\" Grid's voice held no heat. Cold. Factual. \"After this, it's Huroi's share.\"\n\nThe blade moved.\n\n*Pit! Pipipipipit!*\n\n**Link.** The legendary technique Elfin Stone had only heard about in whispers.\n\nThe sword struck. Again. Again. Dozens of times with no pause, each blow hitting before his vampire regeneration could engage. The precision was *wrong*—no human should move like this, controlled and measured despite the speed.\n\n\"KUAAAAAAK!\"\n\nElfin Stone screamed. The second scream of his five-century existence.\n\nThe first had been his birth.\n\nThis one was his education."
