Blood sprayed across the sand.\n\n\"Damn it!\" His teeth ground together as the system chimed.\n\n> [You have killed the poisoned pioneer.]\n> \n> [5]\n> \n> [The poison-soaked cloth has been acquired.]\n> \n> [543,500 experience has been acquired.]\n\nHis jaw clenched. Another notification flashed.\n\n> [You have killed the closed-off pioneer.]\n> \n> [2]\n> \n> [617,000 experience has been acquired.]\n\n\"This is insane!\" Katz drove his sword into the ground, chest heaving.\n\nA month ago, he'd broken into the top 40—39th place on the unified rankings. The climb from 53rd had taken only four weeks, fueled by his epic class and its hunting specialization. Back then, he'd believed first place was inevitable. Just a matter of time.\n\n*What the hell is happening?*\n\nHe played every waking hour. Capsule in, hunt monsters, capsule out to eat and sleep. Repeat. Yet his ranking had stagnated at 39th for weeks. Today, he'd dropped to 40th.\n\nHis pride, already fragile, shattered.\n\n\"I got an epic class!\" He slashed at empty air. \"I declared on stream I'd take first place!\"\n\nNow the whole world was laughing. The second son of JIN, one of Japan's leading conglomerates, reduced to a braggart. A joke.\n\n*It doesn't make sense.*\n\nEven while fighting, his mind churned through the problem. The Blood Warrior's attack power was unmatched. His battle speed exceeded every class he'd encountered. Solo hunting should have been his domain. Yet others were leveling faster.\n\n*How?*\n\nHe was level 215 now. Everyone called the climb from 210 the \"hell section\"—experience requirements spiked, progress slowed to a crawl. But Katz was still advancing steadily, hunting alone where others required full parties.\n\nNone of it mattered. His ranking refused to budge.\n\n\"It's my skill.\" The admission tasted like ash. \"I'm worse than them.\"\n\nHe couldn't accept it.\n\n\"I've never been anything but first!\" His voice cracked. \"Not in any game!\"\n\nCompared to his siblings—the \"geniuses\"—his intellect fell short. His temperament too weak for business. The family had written him off as a successor long ago. But gaming? Gaming was his. The one arena where he eclipsed his brother and sister.\n\nUntil Satisfy.\n\n\"No. I won't accept this.\"\n\nA loser in reality, unable to cross the wall his siblings represented. Fine. He'd made his peace with that. But Satisfy was supposed to be different.\n\nHe pulled up his map, eyes narrowing on a region marked in red.\n\n*I'll move to stronger hunting grounds.*\n\nCurrently, he hunted level 230 monsters—creatures that spawned in groups of three, each with different skill sets. Even top rankers brought parties here. Katz, with his lifesteal on every attack, still burned through potions like water.\n\nMoving to higher-level grounds alone? Dangerous. One mistake and he'd die, losing all that precious experience.\n\nBut Katz had money. Obscene amounts of it.\n\n*Better equipment. Better potions. Whatever it takes.*\n\nHe opened his character sheet. Every piece of equipment glowed with Unique rarity—weapon, armor, accessories. Most players would kill for half his gear.\n\nIt wasn't enough.\n\nHis armor and gauntlets, in particular, disappointed him. He pulled up their stat windows.\n\n---\n\n<span class=\"rarity-unique\">Armor of Great Sorrow</span>\n\n**Rating:** Unique  \n**Durability:** 38/310 **Defense:** 459 **Movement Speed:** -11%\n\n* Reflects 10% of damage received.\n* Once durability drops below 100, all stats increase by 5%.\n\n*Armor worn by Daymode, a former knight, when he fought Piaro and was falsely accused as a traitor. This armor is filled with grudges and pain.*\n\n**User Restriction:** Level 180+, **750 Strength**, **600 Stamina**, Intermediate Heavy Armor Mastery Level 4+\n\n**Weight:** 2,300\n\n---\n\n<span class=\"rarity-unique\">Black Wind Gauntlets</span>\n\n**Rating:** Unique  \n**Durability:** 110/170 **Defense:** 57 **Attack Speed:** +5% **Accuracy:** +10%\n\n*Gauntlets used by the Black Wind Assassins. Very light and comfortable to wear, allowing faster and more accurate attacks.*\n\n**User Restriction:** Level 200+, **220 Agility**\n\n**Weight:** 200\n\n---\n\nThe Armor of Great Sorrow had excellent options, but its raw defense lagged behind comparable heavy armor. The Black Wind Gauntlets performed well enough, but lacked special effects—disappointing for Unique-rated items.\n\n\"I need upgrades.\"\n\nKatz logged out. His bedroom materialized around him—sleek, minimalist, expensive. He grabbed his tablet and pulled up the item trading sites, filtering for armor and gauntlets.\n\nTens of thousands of listings. He scrolled through them all.\n\nNothing. Not a single piece outperformed what he already wore.\n\n\"You've got to be kidding me.\"\n\nHis money was useless here. No amount of wealth could buy what didn't exist.\n\n\"Worthless blacksmiths.\" He hurled the tablet onto his bed. \"When are they going to make something actually worth using? Isn't this their entire job?\"\n\nTwo billion players. Astronomical demand. But production class users grew slowly, their output a trickle against an ocean of need. The entire playerbase was starving for skilled craftsmen.\n\nEuphemina counted herself lucky to have found Grid, the blacksmith who'd made her dagger.\n\nRight now, though, luck felt distant.\n\n---\n\nFrontier, capital of Earl Steim's territory.\n\nHundreds of merchants flowed through the city daily. Euphemina had been here a week, practically living in the market. She'd gathered information from every trader willing to talk, monitored the auction sites hourly, refreshed the trading boards until her eyes burned.\n\nStill nothing. No orb production methods. No leads.\n\n*I never realized how hard this was.*\n\nBefore, she'd never cared about item production. Gear dropped from monsters or came from quest rewards. Simple. Now she understood—high-level crafting recipes were rarer than gold. Harder to find than hidden quests.\n\n\"All this effort for nothing.\" She leaned against a wall, exhaustion pulling at her shoulders. \"Is crafting really this impossible to learn?\"\n\nThe past month had been a tour of every major city in the Eternal Kingdom. Nothing. She'd earned 6,500 gold from the production game and Rabbit's quest, convinced that money would solve the problem.\n\nReality was colder than she'd expected.\n\n*This is getting annoying.*\n\nEuphemina stood outside the auction house, her expression hardening. Her Insight stat—abnormally high—prickled with awareness. Someone was watching.\n\nIt had started two days ago. Not one person. Multiple observers, coordinated, systematic.\n\n*Who?*\n\nShe'd worked hard to stay anonymous. Secret ranker. Private name on the leaderboards. Multiple pseudonyms. She'd sacrificed fame and recognition to move unseen.\n\nSomeone had found her anyway.\n\n\"Unpleasant.\" The word came out flat.\n\nWho? Why? How?\n\nEuphemina turned into a narrow alley, footsteps echoing off stone walls. She stopped in the shadows.\n\n\"Come out.\" Her voice carried in the silence. \"I know you're there.\"\n\n---\n\nFaker's heart kicked against his ribs.\n\n*She can't possibly see through Stealth.*\n\nImpossible. He'd reached first place on the assassin rankings in eight months. Eight. Even the Old Sword Demon, who'd held the position since launch, had fallen to Faker's talent.\n\n*A blacksmith shouldn't be able to detect me.*\n\nHe was certain. He opened the party chat.\n\n**[Faker]:** She's bluffing. She must be talking to one of you.\n\nImmediate pushback.\n\n**[Rook]:** Don't make me laugh! We're at a safe distance! She can't see us!\n\n**[Vantner]:** Hey, she's literally staring in YOUR direction...\n\n**[Pon]:** ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ The number one assassin spotted by a blacksmith.\n\n**[Zednos]:** Why did you get so close? Too much pride as number one?\n\nAll of them were Tzedakah Guild members.\n\nIt had started a month ago. News of the production game in Winston reached the guild. They'd mobilized quickly, gathering information on the blacksmith who'd created an Epic-rated dagger. Dozens of witnesses had watched the competition, making details easy to acquire.\n\nID: Erina. Female. Approximately 160cm tall, estimated age 17-19. Bright golden hair to her waist. Appearance described as \"unforgettable.\"\n\nThey'd commissioned an artist based on witness descriptions, then split up to search. Two days ago, Faker had found her in Frontier.\n\nJishuka had given her orders immediately.\n\n**[Jishuka]:** I'll meet her myself. Keep eyes on her until I arrive.\n\nAnd now Faker's surveillance was about to collapse."
