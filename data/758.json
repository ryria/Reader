  "content": "\"Hahaha! The Japanese know good food when they taste it! I have to hand it to them—they have excellent palates!\"\n\nThe second day of the National Competition had wrapped up. Peak Sword, fresh from dinner at a renowned Tokyo establishment, was in dangerously high spirits. He pulled passersby into enthusiastic embraces and broke into spontaneous dancing on the sidewalk.\n\n\"I guess he's happy I won gold,\" Eat Spicy Jokbal muttered, but he'd completely misread the situation.\n\n\"Kimchi as a side dish! They're serving kimchi here! The Japanese truly understand fine cuisine! Fantastic! Puahahaha!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nPeak Sword, president of the Korean Patriotic Society, had discovered that most restaurants in Japan offered kimchi. This revelation filled him with patriotic fervor—Korea's superior food culture had conquered Japanese hearts and minds.\n\n\"And they're charging for it! That's right—that's exactly right! Premium food like kimchi deserves a price! We shouldn't just hand it out free! Even Korean restaurants should charge separately for their side dishes! Yes! Perfect business model!\"\n\n\"Most side dishes in Japan already cost money, you realize—\"\n\n\"Kuhahahaha! Long live kimchi!\"\n\n\"...These lunatics.\"\n\nThe other representatives, exhausted by Peak Sword's one-man cultural crusade, abandoned him to his delusions. Unfortunately, this left Grid alone with the overzealous patriot.\n\n\"Wait, they don't have jjamppong in this country?\"\n\nGrid, it turned out, was locked in his own separate world.\n\n***\n\n*\"The day has finally arrived.\"*\n\n*\"Indeed. The final day of the 3rd National Competition. Everyone's been waiting for this—today features the most anticipated events.\"*\n\n*\"Though some wish we had more time. There's been talk of extending the Competition to two weeks, like the Olympics.\"*\n\nThe morning broadcast hummed with excitement. Commentators from networks worldwide speculated freely, their enthusiasm matching that of the viewers. Billions of eyes would be watching today.\n\nWhich nations would crack the top ten overall and secure the country buff? Who would dominate Target Processing? Could Grid maintain his blacksmithing supremacy? Would Kraugel prove himself the world's strongest?\n\nNine events, each capable of generating global headlines.\n\n*\"The first event of the final day is about to begin! Here we go!\"*\n\n\"WAAAHHHHH!\"\n\nThe roar of the crowd shook the Tokyo Dome. First up: the blacksmithing competition. Grid's specialty.\n\n\"We'll be cheering for you from here!\"\n\n\"You've got this! Show the S.A. Group their rule changes don't mean a thing!\"\n\n\"Let's go, Grid!\"\n\nIn the South Korean waiting room, younger players crowded around him, their eyes bright with admiration. The sight stirred something unfamiliar in Grid's chest.\n\n*'People who look up to me...'*\n\nHe'd spent so many years on the receiving end of contempt. Now he inspired envy. The reversal felt surreal, like an elaborate prank that might collapse at any moment.\n\nHis heartbeat thundered in his ears.\n\nGrid refused to let this reality crumble. He needed to prove himself—but the nature of that need had shifted. Once, he'd fought to validate his own worth. Now he fought for those who believed in him, to honor their faith.\n\n\"Believe in me.\"\n\nThe old jinx had long since shattered. Grid smiled at the young players, and they drank in the expression like acolytes before an idol, committing it to memory.\n\n***\n\n\"Remember what I told you before?\"\n\nPanmir approached Grid on the competition stage. In-game, he looked younger than his real-world counterpart—his avatar frozen at the age he'd created it four years ago, eternally capturing youth that had since slipped away.\n\n\"Don't take it too hard if you miss gold today. You're not inferior to anyone.\"\n\nThis year's blacksmithing event judged purely on **item rating**—performance and stats were irrelevant. The rule change clearly disadvantaged Grid, who excelled at creating superior items. Panmir genuinely sympathized. He viewed Grid as a lamb sacrificed to corporate machinations.\n\nGrid recognized the lack of hostility and responded graciously. \"I appreciate the sentiment.\"\n\n\"Haha! Spoken like a true king. I admire your composure in the face of such blatant unfairness.\"\n\nPanmir, who'd dominated the blacksmith rankings for years, understood the cruel mathematics involved. Top-tier blueprints only guaranteed an **Epic** rating—nothing higher.\n\n*'Grid's in the same boat...'*\n\nLike every other participant, Grid had no reliable method for producing Unique-rated items or better. The playing field had been forcibly leveled. Those less skilled than Grid now competed on equal footing.\n\n*'All his achievements, rendered meaningless in one stroke...'*\n\nPanmir checked the timer and moved to his station.\n\nMoments later, the host confirmed all participants were positioned at their assigned furnaces.\n\n\"Look at this turnout! This year's blacksmithing event has fifty competitors! Every nation participating in the 3rd National Competition sent a representative!\"\n\nItem creation relied heavily on probability. A skilled craftsman might produce superior performance, but rating was determined by random chance. With no clear favorite, anyone lucky enough could seize victory. Hence the massive turnout.\n\n*'I prayed all night for this!'*\n\n*'I left offerings at the temple!'*\n\n*'I lit incense at a shrine. Please, just one Unique item!'*\n\nThe blacksmiths had become devout. They adjusted their furnace temperatures and nurtured dreams of glory, pulling out their finest blueprints—premium production methods that guaranteed Epic rating at minimum.\n\n*'This year, I'll finally beat Grid!'*\n\nFifty blacksmiths arranged in five rows drew materials and began crafting. Hammers rose and fell in rhythmic cacophony—a scene common in the Overgeared Kingdom's sprawling workshops.\n\n*\"Many viewers will recall last year, when Player Grid created a growth-type item and claimed gold. The judges valued its potential and awarded him first place.\"*\n\n*\"That decision sparked controversy. Multiple nations questioned whether a Normal-rated item deserved gold, growth potential or not.\"*\n\n*\"This rule change reflects that backlash. This year, only item rating matters. Whoever produces the highest-rated item wins.\"*\n\n*\"Rumor suggests top-ranked blacksmiths have achieved the minimum qualifications to craft legendary items. What happens if multiple players succeed?\"*\n\n*\"They'll advance to a tiebreaker round.\"*\n\n*\"I see. Hmm... I'm genuinely curious about the outcome. Player Grid's unique title—'Only Legendary Item Maker'—may soon become obsolete. I'm eager to see which competitor produces the first legendary item.\"*\n\n**Only Legendary Item Maker.** Grid had long accepted that this title, with its +350 Dexterity bonus, had a limited shelf life. He'd originally been incapable of crafting myth-rated items, but growth had made the impossible routine. Logic dictated that other blacksmiths would eventually reach legendary-tier production as well.\n\n*'The title will probably change.'* Most likely to \"First Legendary Item Maker\" once another blacksmith succeeded. *'Whether the bonus survives is anyone's guess.'*\n\nIf they nerfed the effect, he'd file one hell of a customer service complaint.\n\nGrid retrieved his production method: **Design: Failure**. A blueprint of his own creation, guaranteeing Unique rating at minimum.\n\n*'The rule change doesn't affect me at all.'*\n\nOnly Grid understood the truth. Others couldn't fathom it, but the revised regulations posed no threat to him. The S.A. Group might cater to public opinion, but they wouldn't undermine individual players. Fairness was corporate policy—advantages and disadvantages distributed without favoritism.\n\n\"Let's begin.\"\n\nGrid withdrew the substantial supply of blue orichalcum he'd prepared for this event.\n\n\"Time to work.\"\n\nHe gripped his production hammer, the same one he'd wielded for years. His goal: a legendary-rated Failure. Anything less risked a tiebreaker.\n\n*'Out of fifty competitors, at least one will hit Unique.'*\n\nBut Grid harbored zero doubt.\n\n*'I'm the only one who can craft a legendary item in three hours.'*\n\nHis odds far exceeded one percent.\n\nHe tightened his grip, already envisioning the legendary Failure in Chris's hands.\n\n***\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nTwo hours into the competition, the crowd watched Grid work with mounting sympathy. He seemed pitiable—a victim of rule changes specifically designed to neutralize his advantage.\n\n\"It's futile.\"\n\n\"If I were Grid, I'd march straight to S.A. Group headquarters and burn it down. They're targeting him so blatantly it's insulting.\"\n\n\"But he hasn't complained once. Really puts his character in perspective.\"\n\n\"He's a king. Grid rules hundreds of thousands of people. His composure is oceanic.\"\n\n\"Or maybe he's just thinking of his followers. Showing anger would embarrass them, so he endures it.\"\n\n\"He's not even thirty yet, and he carries himself like that? I'm over fifty, and I respect him.\"\n\nThe crafting process held no visual glamour—heat, cool, hammer, repeat. Yet something about the methodical precision proved hypnotic. The audience remained riveted, watching Grid's powerful yet delicate technique.\n\n\"Time's up!\"\n\nThree hours had evaporated. Some blacksmiths smiled at their results. Others drooped with disappointment. A few glanced at the clock, wishing for more time.\n\n\"Grid?\"\n\nEvery eye turned to him. Before Grid rested a translucent blue blade, shark-like in its sleek menace.\n\n\"Oh! Look at that!\"\n\nThe crowd recognized the greatsword Grid had once wielded. Excitement rippled through the stands as judges began evaluating the submitted items. Panmir wore a satisfied smile.\n\n*'Yes. I got Unique. Lucky me!'*\n\nHe hadn't dared hope for legendary—the probability was 0.01%. Panmir was content. No one could produce a legendary item in three hours. He expected either victory or a tiebreaker with another lucky soul.\n\nThe judging panel completed their assessment. The host received the results and raised his voice.\n\n\"Grid is the winner!\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Player Grid has crafted a legendary-rated item, securing his second consecutive gold medal!\"\n\n\"What??\"\n\nPanmir's eyes bulged in disbelief."
