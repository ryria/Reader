The three lizardmen had cost me two-thirds of my health and every drop of mana I had.\n\n*I only have four skills, and I'm already running on empty...*\n\nFive hundred mana. That was all I had to work with. My recovery rate wasn't terrible, but a single rotation of combat skills left me dry. Rather than waste a potion, I dropped onto a flat rock and waited. Once my health and mana bars refilled, I pushed myself upright and started moving again.\n\n*Two more kills until I level.*\n\nThe canyon monsters no longer terrified me. They were experience waiting to be harvested, just like the Frostlight Orcs had been. Except for one.\n\n*Tadak. Tadak. Tadadak.*\n\nA bizarre, chittering sound descended the curved canyon wall. Fast. Too fast.\n\nI jerked my head up. My bladder nearly gave out.\n\nA spider the size of two fifteen-ton trucks scuttled toward me, defying gravity as it crawled down the sheer stone.\n\n\"C-Canyon Spider!\"\n\nThe apex predator of Kesan Canyon. Level 180. Even the Canyon Lizardmen became prey when caught in its webs. Some users speculated the other monsters hid in caves specifically to avoid this thing.\n\nAnd now it was heading straight for me.\n\n\"H-hik...\"\n\nThe memory hit me like a fist. Trapped. Helpless. Eaten alive. My hands shook. Goosebumps crawled across my skin. My legs refused to obey.\n\n\"*Kikikik...*\"\n\nThe spider's mandibles clicked. It fired a web, then rappelled down the silk strand and stopped directly in front of my face.\n\n\"Aaaaaaack!\"\n\nIts head was disproportionately small for its massive body. The mouth gaped open, revealing rows of needle-sharp fangs glistening with venom.\n\nI swung my dagger blindly. The blade cut nothing but air. The spider swayed on its web, easily avoiding the panicked strike, then fired another thread.\n\n*Swaeeek.*\n\nThe web launched as a compact cocoon, then expanded to three meters wide in less than a second. If that draped over me, I'd become spider food. I knew this. I needed to move. But my legs were jelly.\n\n> [A legend doesn't feel fear easily.]\n\nThe paralysis shattered. My body obeyed. I threw myself sideways, and the web sailed past.\n\nThe spider's eight eyes tracked me. Then the onslaught began.\n\n*Syuk! Syuk!*\n\nWebs fired in rapid succession, creating a lethal net overhead.\n\n\"Dammit!\"\n\nI scrambled across the rocky ground, diving and rolling. My stamina bar dropped. Sweat stung my eyes.\n\n*This damn spider just keeps shooting. If this continues, I'll collapse from exhaustion before it runs out of silk.*\n\nI needed to disrupt its rhythm.\n\n\"Wind Blast!\"\n\nThe blue-green wind blade shot from my dagger and slammed into the spider's abdomen. It shuddered on its web.\n\n> [You have dealt 300 damage to the target.]\n\n\"Are you kidding me? What kind of defense is this?\"\n\nThe +8 Ideal Dagger's Wind Blast had barely scratched it. This thing had more defense than the Frostlight Orc Chief. More than the Canyon Lizardmen. A normal monster shouldn't have stats like this.\n\n*Sure, its health is probably lower than a boss, but what does that matter if I can't even dent it?*\n\nThe spider resumed firing. Faster now.\n\n\"Kuk! Quick Movements!\"\n\nMy evasion and agility spiked. I weaved through the webbing as the buff timer counted down. Wind Blast came off cooldown.\n\n\"Blacksmith's Rage! Wind Blast!\"\n\n*Peeng!*\n\nThe empowered wind blade struck true.\n\n> [You have dealt 344 damage to the target.]\n\n\"This is a scam!\"\n\n\"*Kiyaaak.*\"\n\nMore webs. I dodged and my mind raced.\n\n*Wind Blast alone won't cut it. Unbreakable Justice would do real damage, but...*\n\nThe problem was range. Wind Blast dealt sixty percent of my attack power, but the Ideal Dagger's penalty cut that to thirty percent since I didn't meet the requirements. Unbreakable Justice hit for three hundred percent at full power, but it required melee contact.\n\nAnd I couldn't reach the spider through the web barrage.\n\n*There has to be a way. If I can't approach because of the webs, then...*\n\nI stared at the silk-covered ceiling.\n\n*Wait.*\n\nAn idea sparked.\n\n\"I don't know if this will work, but it's worth a shot!\"\n\nSatisfy's system allowed near-infinite flexibility. Skills could be combined, modified, repurposed. I stepped forward and checked my cooldowns.\n\nWind Blast was ready.\n\nI'd figured out the web pattern by now. I sidestepped the next volley and fired.\n\n*Peeng!*\n\nWind Blast connected. And in that instant, I activated the second skill.\n\n\"Unbreakable Justice!\"\n\nThe dark blue energy of Unbreakable Justice merged with the Wind Blast projectile mid-flight. They didn't cancel or interfere. They *fused.*\n\n*Kiiiiing—!*\n\n> [The new skill fusion has succeeded.]\n> \n> [Fusion skill 'Wind of Justice' has been created.]\n> \n> [Your intelligence has increased by 10 due to the successful fusion of a new skill.]\n\nThe notification windows flashed, but I couldn't read them. A condensed blade of dark blue wind, sharp as any sword master's aura, screamed toward the spider.\n\n\"*Kieek?*\"\n\nThe spider scrambled up its web. Too slow.\n\n*Peeeeeong!*\n\n\"*Kiyaaaaah~!*\"\n\nWind of Justice struck like a battering ram. The spider plummeted, yellow ichor spraying from its mandibles.\n\n*Kuwaaaang!*\n\nIt crashed onto its back, legs flailing. The impact cracked the stone beneath it. Its massive carapace prevented it from righting itself.\n\nI chugged a mana potion.\n\n\"Blacksmith's Rage! Quick Movements!\"\n\nPower flooded my limbs. I charged. The spider's legs lashed out wildly, catching my shoulder and thigh, but Quick Movements kept the damage shallow.\n\n\"Now!\"\n\nThe legs tangled in empty air. I drove the Ideal Dagger into the spider's exposed chest. The back, legs, and head were armored in thick chitin, but the underbelly was only covered in coarse hair.\n\n*Puok!*\n\n> [You have dealt 2,880 damage to the target.]\n> \n> [The Best Gauntlets option effect is activated, causing you to attack the target twice.]\n> \n> [You have dealt 6,040 damage to the target.]\n\n\"*Kieeeeeeek!*\"\n\nThe shriek echoed through the canyon. I twisted the blade deeper.\n\n\"Revenge! This is for every time you bastards killed me! Kuhahahahat!\"\n\nHow many times had I died here? Stabbed by lizard tails, crushed by falling rocks, paralyzed and trampled. Eaten alive. This canyon had taken my items, my experience, my sanity. It had given me a spider phobia.\n\nBut I wasn't that Grid anymore.\n\n\"Now YOU get to be afraid!\"\n\n*Puoook!*\n\n\"*Kiyaaaaah~!*\"\n\n> [You have defeated a canyon spider.]\n> \n> [18 gold has been acquired.]\n> \n> [The canyon spider's leg has been acquired.]\n> \n> [The canyon spider's eyeball has been acquired.]\n> \n> [The canyon spider's spiderweb has been acquired.]\n> \n> [387,500 experience has been acquired.]\n> \n> [Your level has risen.]\n\nI stood over the corpse, chest heaving, dagger dripping ichor. The sight of those eight curled legs didn't make my skin crawl anymore.\n\n***\n\nHigh above, on a cliff edge invisible from the canyon floor, a man watched.\n\n\"The first person I've seen solo a canyon spider in years.\" Piaro's eyes narrowed. \"His technique is crude, but his growth rate...\"\n\nHe replayed the fight in his mind. The spider losing its web, crashing onto its back, unable to fire a recovery anchor to nearby terrain. Lucky. If it had landed face-down near the wall, it would have reattached instantly and torn the boy apart.\n\nBut luck was a type of strength.\n\n\"His ability improves with every kill. His potential...\" Piaro's hand drifted to the farming tools at his waist. \"He could be my agent of revenge.\"\n\nOnce, Piaro had been the strongest knight of the Saharan Empire. Captain of the Red Knights. Until betrayal had branded him a traitor and forced him into hiding in this forsaken canyon.\n\n\"Asmophel...\" The name came out like poison. \"I will make you die screaming.\"\n\nTrackers scoured the continent for him. He couldn't leave this place. Not yet. But he didn't need to. He needed someone who could reach Asmophel. Someone who could destroy the man who had ruined Piaro's life and slaughtered his comrades.\n\nGrid, the awkward boy flailing at spiders, had just proven himself a candidate.\n\nPiaro smiled. It wasn't a pleasant expression."
