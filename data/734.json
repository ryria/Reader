Chris surveyed the exhausted faces of the soldiers surrounding him—men who had marched through scorching sands without rest, who had thrown themselves into battle the moment they arrived. Their eyes were shadowed with fatigue, their movements sluggish.\n\n\"The men need time to recover,\" Chris announced. \"We'll rest in Reidan before marching home.\"\n\nA ripple of relief passed through the ranks. Several soldiers openly wept.\n\n\"Thank you, my Lord!\"\n\n\"The Duke shows mercy!\"\n\nChris watched them with quiet satisfaction. These warriors had answered the call without hesitation, driven by loyalty to Grid. They deserved this respite. Besides, a forced march back across the desert in their current state would break half of them.\n\nGrid approached, his expression grateful. \"I appreciate you staying to handle this. Housing and feeding tens of thousands of men... the cost alone—\"\n\n\"It's my duty as Duke of the Overgeared Kingdom,\" Chris said, waving off the concern. \"You don't need to thank me.\"\n\nGrid studied his companion for a moment, then smiled. \"Even so... it feels good. Having strong allies I can depend on.\"\n\nThe words carried weight. Chris knew Grid's history—the days when he'd fought alone, trusted by no one. Those shadows still lingered behind the man's eyes.\n\n\"Go,\" Chris said. \"I'll see to everything here.\"\n\n***\n\nThe reporters had arrived in Reidan expecting one story.\n\nChristopher Chen—Canada's golden child, the ranker who had held the top national spot for over a year—had refused to hold a press conference on home soil. *'If you want to interview me, come to Reidan,'* he'd said, citing his responsibilities as Duke. The Canadian media had agreed to his terms, dispatching their best journalists.\n\nThey'd come prepared with hundreds of questions about the upcoming National Competition. What were Chris's goals? His predictions? How would Canada fare against the other nations?\n\nNone of that mattered now.\n\n\"Make way! The Duke returns in triumph!\"\n\n*Boom!*\n\n*Boom! Boom! Boom!*\n\nThe thunder of marching feet rolled across the city. Rank upon rank of soldiers filled the streets, their armor glinting in the afternoon sun. The procession stretched as far as the eye could see.\n\nSarah Kang, senior correspondent for CBC News, felt her jaw go slack. She turned to her cameraman, whose face had gone pale.\n\n\"How many?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Forty thousand. Maybe more.\"\n\n\"That's impossible. Intelligence reports said the Overgeared Kingdom only has sixty thousand total troops. If forty thousand are stationed here, in a *secondary* city—\"\n\nThe implications crashed over her like a wave. Every analyst had underestimated the kingdom's strength. This wasn't a fledgling nation struggling to find its footing. This was a military power that could field armies to rival established kingdoms.\n\n\"This is Grid's doing,\" her cameraman murmured, his camera already recording. \"The man attracts strength like gravity.\"\n\nSarah was already composing the headline in her mind when a commotion near the city gates caught her attention.\n\n\"An envoy from the Saharan Empire requests an audience!\"\n\nThe square fell silent.\n\nSarah's heart began to race. An imperial envoy? Here?\n\nShe watched Chris's expression shift from surprise to wariness. The Duke clearly understood what she was only beginning to grasp—the Empire and the Overgeared Kingdom were not on friendly terms. Not since Grid had stopped paying tribute. An envoy could only mean pressure, threats, or worse.\n\nThe crowd parted. A man in the formal regalia of the imperial court stepped forward, his movements precise and measured. Every eye in the square fixed on him.\n\n\"I bear a message from His Imperial Majesty.\"\n\nChris's hand tightened on his sword hilt. \"Speak.\"\n\n\"Emperor Juander extends an offer of peace to the Overgeared Kingdom.\"\n\nMurmurs rippled through the assembled soldiers.\n\nThe envoy continued, his voice carrying across the square. \"Furthermore, should King Grid desire it, His Imperial Majesty is prepared to declare an immediate truce with Valhalla.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nNot the tense silence of before, but something deeper. The words didn't make sense. The Empire didn't *ask* for peace. The Empire *commanded*. The Empire *crushed*. Juander was the absolute ruler of the West Continent—a man who moved nations like pieces on a board, who answered to no one.\n\nAnd yet here stood his envoy, offering peace. Seeking accommodation with Grid's will.\n\nSarah's hands trembled as she gripped her recorder. This wasn't just news. This was history.\n\n*The Empire negotiated.*\n\n*The Empire showed weakness.*\n\n*Because of Grid.*\n\nChris cleared his throat, visibly struggling to maintain his composure. \"Perhaps we should continue this discussion in the Great Hall.\"\n\nHe began ushering the envoy away from the crowd, but Sarah had already heard enough. Every reporter in the square had heard enough.\n\n\"I need to file this story immediately,\" she said to her cameraman. \"Logout. Now.\"\n\nAround them, two dozen other journalists vanished into thin air as they disconnected from Satisfy.\n\nThe world needed to know.\n\n***\n\n**[BREAKING: Saharan Empire Requests Peace with Overgeared Kingdom]**\n\n**[Intelligence Failure: Overgeared Military Strength Far Exceeds Estimates]**\n\n**[Empire Engages in Diplomacy for First Time in Recorded History—What Does This Mean for the Continental Balance of Power?]**\n\nThe headlines blazed across news sites worldwide. Within hours, the Overgeared Kingdom dominated every major discussion forum. Analysts scrambled to revise their assessments. Political commentators wrote think-pieces about the shifting power dynamics of the West Continent.\n\nThrough it all, Grid sat in his office making underwear with his God Hands and wondering what the hell was going on.\n\n\"This makes no sense,\" he muttered, watching the golden hands stitch perfect seams. \"Why is Juander doing this? What's his angle?\"\n\nA knock at the door interrupted his brooding.\n\n\"It's Lauel.\"\n\n\"Thank god. Get in here.\"\n\nThe advisor entered, looking far too pleased with himself. He flashed Grid a thumbs up.\n\n\"Brilliant work, Your Majesty.\"\n\nGrid blinked. \"What?\"\n\n\"The army you assembled in Reidan? The timing was perfect.\"\n\n\"Lauel, I assembled that army to raid a vampire city. I wasn't trying to—\"\n\n\"I know.\" Lauel's grin widened. \"But consider the Empire's perspective. Most of their forces are committed to the Valhalla invasion. Then suddenly, you mobilize forty thousand troops in Reidan—the region closest to their southern border. To them, it looked like you were preparing to strike while they were vulnerable.\"\n\nGrid opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again.\n\n\"They think I'm about to invade them.\"\n\n\"Exactly. They can't fight wars on two fronts. So Juander pulled out the carrot instead of the stick.\" Lauel settled into a chair, clearly enjoying himself. \"This is the first time in history the Empire has engaged in diplomatic negotiation rather than simply issuing demands. Your name will be recorded in their chronicles, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"That's...\" Grid pressed his palms against his eyes. \"That's ridiculous. The Empire could crush us *and* Valhalla if they committed their full strength. Why would they negotiate?\"\n\n\"Because of your other achievement.\"\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"The Undefeated King's descendant.\"\n\nUnderstanding dawned. During the Valhalla war, Grid had used the 100,000 Army Massacre Sword—Madra's signature technique. The Red Knights had been pushed to the brink of collapse. Everyone assumed the Undefeated King's heir had finally emerged.\n\n\"They're terrified,\" Lauel said simply. \"Emperor Juander remembers what the original Undefeated King was capable of. He's not taking any chances.\"\n\nGrid thought back to his encounter with Madra's death knight—the overwhelming power, the perfect technique, the aura of absolute martial supremacy. If that was merely Madra's reanimated corpse, weakened and constrained...\n\n\"What must he have been like when he was alive?\" Grid whispered.\n\n\"Unstoppable.\" Lauel's expression turned serious. \"But that fear works in our favor. We've bought ourselves breathing room. The minimum duration for a truce is two years. We need to use every moment of that time to build our strength.\"\n\n\"Wait, the minimum is two years? Can't we negotiate for longer?\"\n\n\"The maximum is twenty years, but achieving that requires skilled diplomacy. The negotiator needs a high Diplomatic stat and related skills to convince the other party to agree to extended terms.\" Lauel spread his hands apologetically. \"Unfortunately, no one in the Overgeared Kingdom currently possesses those qualifications.\"\n\n\"What about Huroi?\"\n\n\"He's brilliant at communication and persuasion, but that's different from the Diplomatic stat. That requires completing specific quests.\"\n\nGrid frowned. \"Can he do those quests? Learn the skills?\"\n\nLauel's eyes gleamed. \"Are you giving that order?\"\n\n\"What order?\"\n\n\"For Huroi to pursue the Diplomatic path. There's a quest chain available to high-ranking nobles that unlocks the Diplomat class and opens access to diplomatic skills.\"\n\n\"How difficult?\"\n\n\"Extremely. It typically takes at least six months to complete. And Huroi would need to dedicate himself to it fully—no leveling, no combat missions.\" Lauel watched Grid carefully. \"He'd almost certainly lose his ranker position.\"\n\nGrid's frown deepened. He knew how hard Huroi worked to stay at his side, to remain relevant despite the ever-increasing power gaps. To ask him to sacrifice months of progression, to potentially fall behind permanently...\n\n\"No,\" Grid said finally. \"If the diplomatic path was obviously worthwhile, others would have pursued it already. I won't force that on Huroi. We'll find someone else.\"\n\n\"I understand.\" Lauel nodded, though Grid caught a flicker of disappointment crossing his advisor's face. \"That's probably—\"\n\n\"MY LORD!\"\n\nThe office door crashed open with enough force to crack the frame. Huroi stood in the doorway, wild-eyed and breathing hard.\n\n\"I heard everything from outside! The entire conversation!\" He strode forward, dropping to one knee in a dramatic flourish. \"Entrust this task to me! I will become a diplomat! I will weave words like silk and steel, turn foreign envoys into puppets dancing on the Overgeared Kingdom's strings, and secure peace treaties that last for—\"\n\n\"Is that what diplomats do?\" Grid asked weakly.\n\nHuroi's methods seemed less like international relations and more like psychological warfare, but the man's earnest determination was impossible to dismiss. Grid felt his throat tighten with emotion. Huroi had been standing guard outside his office—as always, watching Grid's back. And now he was volunteering to sacrifice his own advancement without hesitation.\n\n\"Huroi...\"\n\n\"Please, Your Majesty. Let me serve the kingdom in this way.\"\n\nGrid looked at Lauel, who merely smiled and shrugged. Then he looked back at his loyal retainer, who gazed up at him with absolute devotion.\n\n\"All right,\" Grid said quietly. \"The diplomatic path is yours.\"\n\nHuroi's face split into a radiant grin.\n\nAs the man launched into an excited monologue about his plans, Grid made a mental note: *Before the National Competition, I need to craft something special for him.*\n\nThe competition was less than three months away.\n\nHe'd make sure Huroi went into those diplomatic quests equipped with the finest gear a legendary blacksmith could produce."
