  "content": "The world transformed overnight.\n\nElven songs drifted through forest clearings. Armored warriors sparred on beaches that had never known such visitors. Dog-eared merchants appeared on mountain passes, and orcs loitered at village borders.\n\nNo one had imagined sharing their world with other species. The well-read players—those who'd devoured web novels and fantasy comics—adapted quickly. Most people, though, stumbled through the confusion. Fear crept in at the sight of creatures they'd only heard about in stories.\n\nBut humans were nothing if not adaptable. The initial shock faded within weeks. Some saw opportunity and forged partnerships with the newcomers. Others underwent the transformation themselves, joining these new races. A few exploited the species' naivety, while still others hunted them like monsters, selling their parts as trade goods.\n\nIn the end, the world remained unchanged—whether dealing with humans or other species, people were still people. Through it all, the Overgeared Kingdom pointed toward a different path.\n\n\"Hey, you there! Get the orcs to handle the heavy lifting!\"\n\n\"Send in the wildlings—their noses work better than our eyes!\"\n\nA society without prejudice. Ability mattered, not bloodline or race or station. As long as you had skill—or at the very least, passion—the Overgeared Kingdom offered opportunity and fair compensation. The results spoke for themselves.\n\n*The Overgeared King suffered injustice himself,* people said. *That's why his kingdom is free.*\n\nThe truth was more complicated. The Grid who'd endured discrimination bore little resemblance to the man who ruled today. Stories about the old Grid—*Grid used to be like this, Grid did that*—had grown so contradictory that listeners couldn't tell truth from fiction.\n\n\"Are the elves still making headlines?\"\n\nThe meeting room in the Overgeared Palace usually bustled with activity, all ten meritorious retainers gathered to debate policy. Today, only two figures sat at the round table: Grid and Lauel.\n\n\"They still refuse to trust humans.\" Lauel's fingers drummed against the table. \"They're exercising autonomy in every forest on the continent. The friction with human settlements continues. Cooperation isn't on their agenda.\"\n\n\"I understand why they can't trust us...\"\n\nGrid knew the elves' history of suffering. Peaceful by nature, they'd been branded as prey—coveted, enslaved, sacrificed throughout their long existence. Even players had tried to chain them. Kir, the so-called Merchant King, had been among the worst offenders. Grid himself had freed the elves from that bastard's grip.\n\nLauel's expression softened at Grid's obvious distress. \"The elves are a wounded people. They may trust you personally, but trusting humanity as a whole? That's beyond them. Out of loyalty to you, they at least avoid the Overgeared Kingdom's forests.\"\n\n\"I hope time heals those wounds...\" Grid paused. \"Wait. The elven population is relatively small. How are they controlling forests across an entire continent?\"\n\n\"The elves themselves are an upper species, and the Te leading each tribe are exceptional warriors. But more than that—the forest beasts are friendly to them. At an elf's request, hundreds of thousands of animals will attack human intruders. Armies and player groups worldwide can't reclaim the forests.\"\n\n\"Kir only managed to capture them because of the Yatan Essence. Without that corruption, they're formidable. And they have the elementals on their side.\"\n\nEven top rankers would struggle against the twelve Te. In a forest environment, Grid himself would need to tread carefully. With the beasts at their command, the elves' small numbers meant little—occupying and defending the forests posed no challenge. Unless the Empire decided to act.\n\n\"What's the Empire's position?\"\n\n\"The elves can't threaten the Empire, and the Empire has no justification to invade the forests. No conflict between them. It's just us and the Empire operating normally.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\n\"Most nations besides the Overgeared Kingdom and the Empire have lost access to their forests. Mines have shut down. Logging, hunting, gathering—all economic activity in forested regions has ground to a halt.\"\n\n\"Which means...\"\n\n\"Prices are skyrocketing. Minerals, timber, herbs, leather—every commodity tied to forest resources. Some players saw this coming and stockpiled goods when the elves first mobilized, but individual economic power has limits.\" Lauel smiled. \"Fortunately, I moved faster and bought up everything I could.\"\n\n\"The Overgeared Kingdom and Empire still have operational forests?\"\n\n\"Correct.\"\n\n\"Damn.\"\n\nThe implications were staggering. The Overgeared Kingdom and Empire would control the entire equipment market. The Empire had cultivated tens of thousands of NPC blacksmiths, thousands of player smiths, and numerous craftsman-level artisans. Between the two nations, they supplied the majority of items on the market—and the Overgeared Kingdom set the prices for high-end gear. With monopoly control over raw materials, the two powers effectively held the entire economy in their hands.\n\nMoney moved the world. Perhaps faster than anyone realized, the Overgeared Kingdom and Empire would carve up the entire West Continent between them.\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Are you frightened?\" Lauel asked, noting Grid's stiff expression when he should have been celebrating.\n\n\"You know what? I still haven't seen most of my own kingdom.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Someone tells me about Yorel City—where it is, how many people live there, what they specialize in. But I've never laid eyes on it myself. There are hundreds of cities and villages like that. What happens when my territory expands dozens of times larger? When hundreds of times more people serve under me? I can't manage that.\"\n\n\"There's a path to becoming emperor—appoint multiple kings and share the burden. The Saharan Empire would acknowledge you.\"\n\n\"...That terrifies me even more.\"\n\nHis colleagues' loyalty...\n\nHe worried about the parasites that would cling to them. What if the ten meritorious retainers became kings? Each would need staff to manage their territories. And among those staff, ambitious schemers would inevitably appear. The Overgeared Kingdom and Overgeared Guild would rot from within. Worst case scenario—civil war beyond his control.\n\nWhen Grid voiced these concerns, Lauel smiled. \"Being emperor is never easy.\"\n\n\"Thank you for understanding. If I had the ability, I wouldn't worry about these small things. But you know what kind of person I am. I can't handle the position of emperor.\"\n\nToo modest. Grid noticed more than he gave himself credit for—like when he'd given Failure to Prince Shining. Still, Lauel respected Grid's stance. Forcing someone into the emperor's role when they didn't want it created all kinds of problems. And truthfully, Grid wasn't ready to rule an empire many times the size of his current kingdom.\n\n\"Then what's your goal? Maintain your current position while steadily developing the Overgeared Kingdom to a manageable size?\"\n\n\"Hmm... That was the plan until recently. But I've changed my mind.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Supremacy is just a process. A means to an end.\"\n\n\"...!\"\n\n\"The reality of the gods. The seven malignant saints. The expelled gods. The yangbans and the Hwan Kingdom. Pagma and the great demons...\" Grid paused, letting the weight of those names settle. The backbone of Satisfy itself. \"I want to understand everything about them. And I need strength to reach that truth.\"\n\nLauel's heart quickened. Wealth, honor, power—the ultimate goals most people chased their entire lives—were nothing but stepping stones to Grid now. His mentor's thinking had reached a level far beyond the mundane.\n\n\"After I uncover the truth, I think I'd like to retire. Run a small smithy. Just enough work to keep my mind sharp.\"\n\n\"Haha... That sounds wonderful. You'd be comfortable and satisfied every day.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Where would this smithy be?\" Lauel wasn't asking about location, but dimension. Players lived in both reality and Satisfy—two separate worlds.\n\nGrid laughed. \"Both, obviously.\"\n\n***\n\n[The Violet Kingdom has been destroyed.]\n\n[Former citizens of the Violet Kingdom have become 'refugees.' Refugees suffer increased stamina consumption and increased damage received...]\n\n[The Twilight Orc Kingdom has been founded!]\n\n[The roar of Great Orc Lord 'Uruchan' shakes the continent!]\n\nHistory unfolded as scheduled. The Violet Kingdom lasted less than three months before the orc army's invasion. The orcs' terrifying recovery and reproduction rates overwhelmed even the multinational relief forces.\n\nA new kingdom. For the first time in centuries, a nation of non-humans had emerged. Players who'd transformed into orcs and contributed to the war effort reaped rewards—new classes like 'champion,' massive stat increases, and political positions.\n\n\"Can even the Empire and Overgeared Kingdom handle the orcs' numbers?\"\n\nPublic opinion shifted. Analysts predicted the twilight orcs could challenge the continental supremacy currently divided between the Empire and Overgeared Kingdom.\n\nThen, surprisingly...\n\n\"It's quiet.\"\n\nThe orcs showed no interest in expansion. They lived peacefully within their conquered territory, seemingly content with their new borders.\n\nUntil the incident.\n\n[Orc Lord Uruchan has been defeated and killed in ritual combat!]\n\n[Teruchan, victor of the challenge, has been crowned the new Orc Lord!]\n\n[Teruchan's Declaration:]\n\n\"We! Orcs! Want bigger territory!! Guruk! Gruruk!\"\n\nThe orc march began under their new leader's command. Kingdom after kingdom suffered constant invasion and pillaging. The Fold Kingdom was among the first to feel their fury."
