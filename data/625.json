Who the hell would choose to live here?\"\n\n\"Should've listened when those Winston NPCs told us to buy furs...\"\n\n\"Never ignore NPC advice. Lesson learned.\"\n\nFrontier—capital of Duke Steim's northern territories and the northernmost reach of the Overgeared Kingdom. Snowstorms howled year-round, and the bitter cold hit first-time visitors like a hammer. Lower-level players shuffled through the streets, teeth chattering, extremities going numb.\n\n\"How did this frozen hellhole become the most prosperous city in the north?\"\n\n\"Right? You can't grow crops in this cold. Half the year, people must be stuck indoors.\"\n\nIn the days of the Eternal Kingdom, monsters had infested these northern reaches. But Duke Steim—intrepid, relentless—had driven them back, carving out space for civilization to take root. The question remained: how did a territory too cold for agriculture become wealthy?\n\nThe answer lay in what Duke Steim *hadn't* cleared. Monster habitats still dotted the landscape, and the northerners had built their economy around them. They hunted. They butchered the meat. They exported accessories crafted from monster parts. They even rode the tamable ones. Wealth accumulated despite the harsh climate.\n\nAs for the cold itself? The saying went: *Northerners don't feel the cold.* Visitors assumed it was natural fortitude—some genetic blessing. \n\nThe actual truth was far more mundane.\n\n\"Stay warm with these! Guaranteed protection from frostbite!\"\n\n\"Northern Underwear—the secret every local knows!\"\n\n\"Don't freeze to death! Buy now!\"\n\nThe moment a shivering group of players stumbled into Frontier's gates, NPC merchants swarmed them like vultures. Each one brandished thick, furry undergarments.\n\n\"Made from genuine yeti fur! Keeps your body from freezing solid! Every northerner wears these—it's not optional up here!\"\n\nGrid, watching from beneath his wide-brimmed hat, raised an eyebrow. *Underwear merchants. An entire economy built on thermal undergarments.*\n\nHe'd seen plenty of tourist traps, but this was a first.\n\nMost players waved the merchants off.\n\n\"Yeah, no thanks. I'm not buying *underwear* from a street vendor.\"\n\n\"How much warmth could underwear even provide?\"\n\nA few checked the item descriptions out of curiosity, then immediately lost interest.\n\n---\n\n**[Northern Underwear]**  \n*Thick yeti leather underwear designed to insulate against extreme cold.*\n\n* **Cold Resistance +5%**\n* **Agility -5%**\n* **All leg-based skills reduced by 10%**\n\n---\n\n\"Five percent cold resistance for a five percent agility penalty? Hard pass.\"\n\n\"At least it *has* stats. Didn't know underwear could do that.\"\n\n\"Not worth crippling my mobility. I'll just deal with being cold.\"\n\nMages might not care about agility, but for most classes, the trade-off was unacceptable. The disappointed players hurried deeper into the city, leaving the merchants to their pitch.\n\n\"I'll take a look.\"\n\nGrid stepped forward, drawing a few curious glances. Despite the sub-zero temperature, he wasn't shivering. No furs. No visible cold-weather gear. Just a long coat and that hat pulled low, obscuring his face.\n\nHe examined the underwear, turning it over in his hands. \"The stats are identical across all the types you're selling. Is there better quality available?\"\n\nThe merchant's expression shifted—surprise, then wariness. \"There *is* better underwear, but it's exclusive. Nobility only.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Only one tailor in all of Frontier can craft the premium stuff. Limited supply, high cost. Not something we can sell to travelers.\"\n\nGrid's mind clicked into gear. *Not just any tailor can make underwear. Otherwise, it'd be mass-produced. This is specialized knowledge.*\n\nMade sense. In a frozen hellscape like this, developing effective cold-weather gear would be essential. One tailor must have mastered it.\n\n\"Where can I find this tailor?\"\n\nThe merchant shrugged. \"Nobody knows. Disappeared one day. Poof.\"\n\n\"Disappeared? When?\"\n\n\"Recently. No warning, no explanation. Just vanished.\"\n\n\"Damn.\" Grid grimaced. *Of course. Nothing about this class quest is straightforward.*\n\nHe'd have to track down the missing tailor, convince him to teach the craft, and complete the underwear production method. Standard legendary class quest nonsense.\n\nGrid pulled his hat lower and began moving through Frontier's streets, asking questions, following leads. He kept his tone casual, his inquiries vague—but every NPC he spoke to brought him closer to the truth.\n\nAnd drew more attention than he intended.\n\n---\n\n### **Earl Bruno's Estate—Basement**\n\n\"There's been reports of a suspicious individual asking about Sir Fatima.\"\n\nFatima. Advanced Tailor. One of Frontier's treasures. When he vanished, the noble families had panicked—how would they replace their custom thermal undergarments? Search parties were organized. Discreet inquiries made. Gold offered for information.\n\nNone of it mattered. No one could find what they weren't meant to find.\n\nFatima hadn't fled. He'd been taken.\n\n\"Sir Fatima, you should be *flattered*. So many people searching for you. You're quite popular.\"\n\nThe tailor hung from chains bolted to the stone wall, wrists raw, face haggard. His voice cracked. \"Why are you doing this?\"\n\nEarl Bruno sat in a plush chair, legs crossed, inspecting his nails with idle contempt. \"Isn't it obvious? I want your underwear.\"\n\n\"I've *sold* you underwear! Multiple times!\"\n\n\"I don't want to *buy* it.\" Bruno's smile was cold. \"I want to know how to *make* it. Teach me the production method for your luxury line, and I'll let you live.\"\n\nFatima's mind raced. Earl Bruno had always been ambitious, but this? The man wasn't just greedy—he was calculating. He'd seen something no one else had: the untapped potential of functional underwear. If someone could produce specialized variants—fire resistance, poison immunity, stamina recovery—and sell them to royalty across the continent...\n\nThe profit margins would be staggering.\n\n\"Does Duke Steim know about this?\"\n\nBruno laughed—a harsh, bitter sound. \"You think I'd share a goldmine with a *traitor*?\"\n\n\"Traitor?\" Fatima's blood ran cold.\n\nEarl Bruno had been Duke Steim's right hand for decades. When Grid founded the Overgeared Kingdom and elevated Steim to Duke, the first thing Steim did was promote Bruno to Earl. Trust, absolute and unquestioned.\n\nAnd now Bruno was calling him a traitor.\n\n\"Isn't that what he is?\" Bruno's voice dripped venom. \"Abandoning his loyalty to the Eternal royal family, helping his son-in-law's rebellion—what else would you call it?\"\n\n\"You're part of the Anti Grid Alliance.\"\n\nIt wasn't a question.\n\nBruno's grin widened. \"Over ten percent of the Overgeared Kingdom's nobility belong to us. Oh, they *seem* loyal to Grid. They kneel. They swear oaths. All theater.\" He leaned forward. \"We're going to eliminate Duke Steim first. Swallow the north. Then march on Reinhardt and tear Grid from his stolen throne. But that requires money. Soldiers. Weapons. And your underwear method is going to fund it all.\"\n\nHe stood, circling Fatima like a predator. \"You're from Eternal, aren't you? So cooperate.\"\n\nFatima glared through his exhaustion. \"You're insane.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"The war just *ended*. The kingdom is finally stabilizing. And you want to start another one?\" Fatima's voice shook with fury. \"Do you have any idea what that means? Boys conscripted and sent to die. Families torn apart. Villages burned. You don't care about the people—you're just dressing up your greed as loyalty.\"\n\nBruno's face flushed crimson. He snatched a whip from the table. \"What would a *tailor* know about politics?\"\n\n**Crack.**\n\nThe whip struck. Fatima screamed.\n\n\"Tell me how to make your underwear, or I'll flay the skin from your bones!\"\n\n\"I—I won't—!\"\n\n**Crack. Crack.**\n\nDays bled together. Bruno's torture was methodical, escalating. Fatima's body broke first—cuts, bruises, burns. But his will held longer than Bruno expected. The tailor's pride wasn't easily shattered.\n\nBut pride alone couldn't sustain him forever.\n\n\"It's pointless to resist,\" Bruno hissed, pacing. \"No one's coming for you. No one even knows where you are. Eventually, you'll break. They always do.\"\n\nFatima sagged against his chains, blood dripping from fresh wounds. His resolve flickered like a candle in a storm.\n\nBruno smiled. He could see it. The moment was close.\n\n---\n\n### **Four Days Later—Frontier Streets**\n\n\"Last confirmed sighting was near Earl Bruno's estate.\"\n\nGrid lowered the parchment he'd been scribbling notes on. Four days of investigation, dozens of conversations with NPCs, and he'd finally pieced together the trail. The missing tailor's name: Fatima. Last known location: the vicinity of Earl Bruno's mansion.\n\n\"Earl Bruno.\" Grid frowned. \"He's my father-in-law's right-hand man, isn't he?\"\n\nHe'd been crashing at Duke Steim's castle between investigations—free food, free bed, no questions asked. It was good to be king. But today, Grid hadn't had time to make the trip back. Instead, Steim had personally delivered lunch to him in the city.\n\n\"That's correct, Your Majesty.\"\n\nDuke Steim stood beside Grid's bench, watching him devour roasted yeti meat. The duke's expression was fond, if slightly bemused.\n\n\"Earl Bruno is my most trusted advisor. Old-fashioned, perhaps, but his loyalty is ironclad. Your Majesty, please—enjoy the meal. Yeti is excellent for stamina.\"\n\n\"Mm. Good stuff.\" Grid wiped his mouth. \"I should pay Earl Bruno a visit. Maybe he saw Fatima before he disappeared.\"\n\n\"Of course. But may I ask, Your Majesty—why are you looking for Fatima?\"\n\n\"I need to learn how to make underwear.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nDuke Steim blinked. \"I'm sorry. I thought you just said—\"\n\n\"I need to learn underwear production.\"\n\n\"...Your Majesty. You are a *king*. Why in the world would you need to make underwear?\"\n\nGrid shrugged. \"It's part of my job.\"\n\n\"Your... job.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nDuke Steim looked like he wanted to ask seventeen follow-up questions but couldn't figure out where to start.\n\nGrid stood, brushing crumbs off his coat, and handed the empty lunchbox back. \"Thanks for the meal, Father-in-law. This really hit the spot.\"\n\nHe pulled his wide-brimmed hat down and grinned.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to meeting your right-hand man.\""
