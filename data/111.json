The weight settled into his palm like an old friend. *If I can't run, I'll fight.*\n\nHe exploded upward. His agility stat launched him halfway up the stone wall before momentum carried him higher. The Guardian's massive face loomed before him.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship!\"\n\nThe sword dance triggered mid-air. Grid's body twisted. Dainsleif became a blur of silver as he drove the point toward the golem's eye.\n\n\"**Kill!**\"\n\nThe impact rang through the cavern like a bell.\n\n> **[Critical Hit!]**\n> \n> **[The Best Gauntlets option effect is activated, causing you to attack the target twice.]**\n> \n> **[You have dealt 68,700 damage.]**\n\n*Kuwaaah!*\n\nThe Guardian staggered. Thousands of kilograms of enchanted stone lurched backward. Grid landed in a crouch, boots skidding across debris-strewn ground.\n\n\"I can do this!\"\n\nThe math ran through his head. **Kill** dealt **1,500%** of his attack power. Single target. Devastating. It had been the finishing blow against Malacus. Even a boss monster should buckle under that kind of force delivered straight to its face.\n\nGrid straightened, grinning. \"Nearly seventy thousand in one hit! This thing's going down!\"\n\nHe'd spent hours grinding through the labyrinth's golem population. They all shared the same weakness: high defense, pathetic health pools averaging **80,000 HP**. Simple pattern recognition. The Guardian should follow the same design.\n\n\"Wait.\"\n\nHis smile froze.\n\nThe health bar above the Guardian's head barely showed a dent. The crimson sliver he'd carved away was... insignificant.\n\n\"That's impossible.\" Grid's voice came out flat. \"The damage barely registered.\"\n\nHigh defense *and* high health. His strongest attack—one of the strongest skills in all of Satisfy—had landed as a critical hit and deleted only one-fifteenth of the boss's total HP.\n\n*Simple math. Fifteen more Kills. All critical. Kill's cooldown is 500 seconds.*\n\nHe clenched his jaw. *Fine. I have other tools.*\n\nThe <span class=\"rarity-rare\">Ideal Dagger</span> slid into his left hand. Grid aimed low and triggered the skill.\n\n\"**Wind Blast!**\"\n\nThe gust struck the Guardian's leg.\n\n> **[You have dealt 1 damage.]**\n\nThe wind couldn't even scratch that defense. Perfect.\n\nWhile the Guardian's attention tracked downward, Grid activated **Quick Movements**. His body blurred. He closed the distance and unleashed Dainsleif in a silver arc.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship, **Link!**\"\n\n*Jjejeong! Jjang! Jjejejeok!*\n\nEight strikes in rapid succession. **Link** was efficient. Shorter cast time than Kill. Lower mana cost. Faster cooldown. It dealt **500%** attack power per strike. Not Kill's overwhelming force, but reliable.\n\nThe impacts jarred his arms.\n\n> **[You have dealt 3,500 damage.]**\n\n\"You've got to be kidding me!\" The numbers mocked him. His confidence drained like water through cupped hands. *Can I actually kill this thing?*\n\n*Kuuong!*\n\nOne step. The Guardian closed the gap Grid had so carefully maintained with a single stride.\n\n*Kuwaaah!*\n\nThe roar preceded the descending hand. Grid was an insect to be swatted.\n\n*Kwaang!*\n\nGrid threw himself sideways. The golem's fist cratered the stone where he'd been standing. The entire chamber shook. Grid stumbled, fighting for balance.\n\n*An earthquake. It's causing earthquakes with its bare hands.*\n\nThe next blow came before he recovered.\n\n*Kwaang! Kwaang! Kwaaaaang!*\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\nBuddha's palm. Every dodge brought another impact. The Guardian's fists pounded walls, floor, ceiling. Stone rained down. Debris piled up. The vast underground chamber contracted with each strike. Grid's options dwindled with every cubic meter lost to rubble.\n\n\"I'm screwed.\"\n\nThe Guardian roared. Finality echoed in that sound.\n\nBoth hands swept inward. Left and right. Massive palms twice Grid's height, closing like a vice. His vision disappeared behind advancing stone.\n\n*No room to dodge. No gaps. Nowhere to go.*\n\nThe <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Divine Shield</span> might block it. Might. But the shield would shatter. Grid knew it in his bones.\n\n\"Grid!\"\n\nA woman's voice pierced through from above. Jishuka appeared at the broken ceiling, her face pale.\n\nShe'd come searching for him. The guild chat had gone silent. The tremors had drawn her here. \n\nNow she arrived in time to watch him die.\n\n\"He can't avoid this.\" Vantner stood beside her, voice heavy.\n\nGrid's death was inevitable. What had he been thinking, challenging a giant golem solo? How could a non-magician even scratch something like that? Stupidity. Pure stupidity.\n\nThen Grid spoke.\n\n\"If I can't avoid it, I'll meet it head-on.\"\n\n*Pachichik!*\n\nRed sparks crawled across Grid's body. An instant before the hands closed.\n\n*Kakakakak!*\n\nCrimson lightning tore through the ceiling and struck the Guardian's skull.\n\n*Chwachachachak!*\n\nThe golem convulsed. Muscles of stone locked rigid. Its entire body glowed bright red. The voltage was wrong. Higher than any natural lightning. Wrong color. Wrong intensity.\n\nJishuka and Vantner stared.\n\n\"Magic?\" Jishuka breathed. \"Grid can use magic?\"\n\n\"Red lightning...\" Vantner shook his head. \"I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nGrid stood unharmed. He slipped through the gap between the Guardian's paralyzed hands and allowed himself a smile.\n\n\"Nice effect.\"\n\nIn his left palm, a crimson bead the size of a fist pulsed with residual power. The **Red Lightning Summoning Bead**. Loot from the Frostlight Orc Chief. It had languished in his inventory for weeks.\n\nNow it had saved his life.\n\n*Pachichik! Pachik!*\n\nRed sparks danced along Dainsleif's blade. The Guardian stood helpless. The cooldown timer for **Kill** hit zero.\n\nGrid began the sword dance.\n\n*Peeeeeong!*\n\n> **[Critical Hit!]**\n> \n> **[The Best Gauntlets option effect is activated, causing you to attack the target twice.]**\n> \n> **[You have dealt 141,000 damage.]**\n\nThe lightning attribute transformed Dainsleif into a true magic sword. The Guardian's physical defense was meaningless against elemental damage. **Kill** bit twice as deep.\n\n\"That's broken!\"\n\n\"His damage is just cheating.\"\n\nJishuka and Vantner watched one-tenth of the boss's health evaporate in a single blow.\n\nThe Guardian's panic was palpable. It abandoned pattern. Its arms whipped out faster, sloppier, desperate.\n\n\"Yes! Come on!\"\n\nGrid didn't retreat. He met Dainsleif against stone.\n\n*Jjang! Jjaaang! Kwaang!*\n\nThe red lightning's power was extraordinary. Each contact point glowed crimson. Smoke rose from scorched stone. Parts of the Guardian's arms stiffened, paralyzed by residual voltage.\n\nThe golem tried to pull back.\n\nGrid's blacksmith hammer appeared in his hand. He swung.\n\n*Kaaang!*\n\nThe sound rang pure. Metal on stone. Grid blinked.\n\nThe Guardian's arm was... changing. Deforming under his hammer like hot metal on an anvil.\n\n*This is just like forging.*\n\nExcitement flooded through him.\n\n*Kaaang! Kaaang! Kaaang!*\n\nGrid circled the Guardian, hammering joints. Wrists. Elbows. The articulation points flattened. The five-fingered hands melted into crude clubs. The Guardian's arms became nothing more than heavy pillars of useless stone.\n\n*Kuoh?*\n\nConfusion radiated from the golem. It swung blindly. The underground chamber collapsed further. If Grid was going to die here, he'd drag this monster down with him.\n\nA mana potion appeared in his hand. He drained it in one pull.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship, **Transcend.**\"\n\nThe skill he'd never used. Too expensive. But every level-up had added points to Intelligence. <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Malacus' Cloak</span> expanded his mana pool. Now he had enough.\n\n> **[Transcend]**\n> \n> *A sword dance that transcends imagination.*\n> \n> *Your attack power is doubled and your default attacks will turn into ranged attacks.*\n\nThe air reversed.\n\n*Kuoooooh.*\n\nGravity inverted. Grid's hair rose. Stones lifted from the ground and hung suspended. In the center of the distortion, Grid raised Dainsleif.\n\nA blade of dark energy erupted forward.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms:** [Link]\n\n**OG:** [Glossary Link]\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\n**Support:** Check out my Patreon for early access to unedited chapters and help achieve goals for extra releases.
