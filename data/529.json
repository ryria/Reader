The sudden shift felt surreal—almost dreamlike in its coordinated precision.\n\n*Pagma?*\n\nGoosebumps prickled along Grid's arms as he spotted the source of the disturbance. A group of figures moved through the center of the street, walking past the bowing masses with unhurried grace. They wore flowing blue daoist robes, their long black hair bound up in identical styles. The resemblance to Randy's transformation in the Mysterious Forest was uncanny—these people looked exactly like Pagma.\n\n*Who are they?*\n\nEach robed figure possessed an otherworldly beauty that seemed almost inhuman. Grid's mind raced. Why did they resemble Pagma so closely? And why were the crowds prostrating themselves?\n\nSomeone jabbed Grid's ribs—a trembling NPC whose head remained firmly bowed, as if terrified of drawing attention.\n\n\"Are you insane? Not bowing before the yangban—do you have ten lives to throw away?\"\n\n\"Yangban?\" Grid kept his voice low.\n\n\"Residents of the Hwan Kingdom!\" the NPC hissed.\n\n*The Hwan Kingdom...* Grid's thoughts clicked into place. The kingdom that used the white phosphorus tree as its national symbol. He lowered his head slightly and pressed the NPC for more information. \"Is Pangea part of the Hwan Kingdom?\"\n\n\"Tsk, tsk. I should've known you were ignorant the moment you failed to bow.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Pangea belongs to the Cho Kingdom.\"\n\nGrid frowned. \"Then why bow to yangbans from the Hwan Kingdom?\"\n\n\"What kind of question is that? Isn't it natural to show respect to those who serve their kingdom with such distinction? Are you truly this foolish?\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n*Does the Hwan Kingdom operate like some sort of overlord state?*\n\nGrid filed the information away. *So Pagma may have been born in the Hwan Kingdom...* Gradually, the pieces were falling into place. He decided not to dwell on it for now.\n\n\"Hrmm.\"\n\nAt that moment, one of the yangbans passed directly by Grid and offered him a knowing smile. Their eyes met, and Grid felt his breath catch. An overwhelming presence radiated from the yangban—an invisible pressure that made his heart pound against his ribs.\n\n> **[You have an urge to bow.]**\n> **[You have resisted.]**\n\n*Just from making eye contact?*\n\nGrid's throat went dry.\n\n*Could this be... the power of a legend?*\n\nHis mind reeled with implications.\n\n\"Huhut.\"\n\nThe yangban's coy laughter drifted back as the group moved beyond Grid's field of view.\n\n---\n\n**Idan's Restaurant**\n\n\"Would you like me to prepare the citron tea in advance?\"\n\nYang Fei's question came with her usual impassive expression, her cat-like features betraying no emotion. Grid didn't respond immediately—his thoughts remained tangled with the yangban he'd encountered on the street.\n\n*I'm certain of it. That was a legend-grade presence.*\n\nWhen Braham had first possessed his body, Grid had witnessed the vampire gather mana with overwhelming force. The yangban's aura matched that memory perfectly.\n\n*But... none of the established legends were described as originating from the East Continent. My theory about Pagma coming from here is just speculation.*\n\nThe numbers didn't add up either. There were nine known legends, but he'd seen more than ten yangbans today alone.\n\n*Could there be separate legends for the East Continent?*\n\nDistinct from the nine legends of the West.\n\n*...Actually, that makes perfect sense.*\n\nThe West and East Continents existed in isolation from each other. Of course they would have developed their own legendary figures independently. Separate histories, separate heroes.\n\n*Look at Lord.* His son was considered a genius representing the entire West Continent.\n\n*This changes everything...*\n\nThe world had suddenly expanded. Powerhouses invisible on the West Continent and even in Hell apparently flourished here on the East Continent. Yet Grid didn't feel discouraged. If anything, the discovery energized him.\n\n*This means I can grow even stronger.*\n\nNo matter how powerful he became, he wouldn't be criticized for disrupting game balance—not with threats like this existing in the world. The realization bolstered his confidence.\n\n*I am a legend.* He'd worked hard to reach this point. And he would continue working hard. Yes, like right now.\n\n\"Now! Sorry to keep you waiting!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nIdan set down Grid's breakfast—eggs that looked like they'd survived a culinary war crime. The yolk had been cooked to the point of carbonization, while the whites remained translucent and gelatinous.\n\n\"This is... deliberately bad, right?\" Grid couldn't suppress the comment.\n\nFortunately, Idan took it as praise.\n\n\"It required much more effort than a normal preparation! I separated the yolk from the whites, cooked only the yolk, then poured the raw whites over it—a sauce concept, you see.\"\n\n\"...You could just cook them normally.\"\n\n\"Aish, come now. How pedestrian would ordinary eggs be?\"\n\n\"Even moderately cooked would be—\"\n\n\"I created this dish with a chef's heart, wanting to give my guest the finest egg experience! Using the soft whites to envelop the firm yolk—isn't it innovative?\"\n\n*You could've started with soft-boiled...*\n\nThe dish hadn't been made with malice, which somehow made it worse. Grid desperately wanted to refuse, but he closed his eyes and forced the concoction into his mouth. The uncooked whites coated his teeth with every chew. The overpowering egg smell made breathing difficult, and the charred yolk had lost all flavor—it felt like chewing dry gravel.\n\n*Gulp!*\n\nGrid nearly spat it out but managed to swallow, rewarded with an unexpectedly sweet aftertaste.\n\n> **[You have received food poisoning from eating improperly cooked food.]**\n> **[You have resisted.]**\n> **[Stamina has permanently increased by 1.]**\n\n*The food wasn't even fully cooked...* But Idan was the real problem here. The man clearly had no talent for cooking whatsoever.\n\nGrid exhaled slowly. \"Why didn't you use any salt?\"\n\nAt least that would've made it marginally more palatable. Idan looked affronted by the suggestion.\n\n\"Salt is terrible for your health!\"\n\n*You'll kill someone with this cooking before salt does.*\n\n\"Here.\"\n\nYang Fei set down the citron tea—she'd prepared it beforehand. Grid's face lit up at the prospect of washing away the lingering egg taste. He looked at Yang Fei like she was an angel of mercy.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n*Gulp, gulp.*\n\nHe rinsed his mouth with the fragrant tea, feeling color return to his expression. Yang Fei spoke, her tone carrying an unusual weight.\n\n\"Um... my legs are quite sore today.\"\n\nShe lifted her skirt slightly, exposing pale calves. It was an undeniably provocative gesture. But Grid remained unfazed—he'd developed strict mental boundaries when it came to younger women, especially those who worked in service positions.\n\n\"Right, I'll give you a proper massage today,\" Grid replied absently.\n\n\"...\"\n\nYang Fei's face flushed bright red at his casual response. She'd already grown dependent on Grid's therapeutic touch, though he seemed oblivious to the implications.\n\n---\n\n**White Hammer Smithy Stadium**\n\n\"You came!\"\n\nA massive stadium loomed north of Pangea's castle, its architecture reminiscent of ancient colosseums. Grid entered the waiting room, where White from the White Hammer smithy greeted him enthusiastically.\n\n\"Brother Woodcutter! Thanks to you, we can now generate flames at precise temperatures using the white phosphorus wood. If the White Hammer smithy wins this year's competition, it will be entirely your achievement!\"\n\n*Woodcutter?* Grid found the title odd but didn't question it.\n\n\"What's the competition theme?\"\n\nHis blacksmith's curiosity was piqued. White's expression grew serious.\n\n\"The same as last year—to reproduce Pangea's treasure that was lost during the war two years ago.\"\n\n\"What treasure?\"\n\n\"The **Red Phoenix Bow**.\"\n\n\"The Red Phoenix Bow!\" Grid's interest sharpened immediately.\n\nBased on the name alone, a bow with the red phoenix motif would possess devastating fire properties. Jishuka would have incredible compatibility with such a weapon.\n\n*This is an East Continent treasure, so the base attack power must be exceptional. If I could obtain the production blueprint...*\n\nAcquiring a production method just from observing item creation was virtually impossible—perhaps one in ten thousand blacksmiths could manage it. But Grid was no ordinary blacksmith. As a **Legendary Blacksmith**, he had a chance.\n\n*Of course, the probability of success is still low.* But he'd give it his best effort, as always.\n\nA thought occurred to him. \"Why use the same theme as last year?\"\n\n\"Last year, every blacksmith failed to reproduce the Red Phoenix Bow. The lord intends to maintain the theme until someone creates a perfect replica.\"\n\n\"What does the original Red Phoenix Bow look like? Do you have design blueprints?\"\n\nWhite shook his head. \"It's based on one of the **Four Auspicious Beasts**—the Blue Dragon, White Tiger, Black Tortoise, and Red Phoenix. A bow that channels the devastating destructive power of flame. Unfortunately, the original design has been lost since ancient times. We can only rely on imagination and historical descriptions.\"\n\n\"Hrmm...\"\n\nIf it emphasized fire attributes, would a fire stone be the primary material?\n\n*Melting fire stone and combining it with iron... Iron bows naturally possess high destructive power... No, wait.*\n\nThis was the East Continent. He needed to abandon West Continent assumptions.\n\n*There might be specialized fire-attribute materials native to the East Continent that I'm not aware of... Ah!*\n\nInspiration struck like lightning.\n\n*The white phosphorus wood!*\n\nCertainty flooded through Grid.\n\n*I'm the only one who can recreate the Red Phoenix Bow.*\n\nWhy? Because he was the only blacksmith in the world capable of cutting down a white phosphorus tree! Grid's eyes blazed with intensity.\n\n\"What rewards does the winner receive?\"\n\nNaked ambition glinted in Grid's gaze—a voracious greed that sought to consume every opportunity the world offered. But White, blinded by his own gratitude, misread Grid's expression entirely.\n\n*Look at those passionate eyes! Such dedication to the craft!*\n\nWhite smiled and began explaining the competition benefits."
