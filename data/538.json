  "content": "\"That's a good call.\"\n\nBased on Ung's demonstration, the monsters lurking in this dungeon were far more dangerous than Grid had anticipated. White wouldn't survive down there—not a chance. The blacksmith's decision to step aside aligned perfectly with Grid's own assessment.\n\n*At least he knows his limits.*\n\nGrid found himself warming to the dark-skinned middle-aged man. There was wisdom in knowing when to retreat. He was regarding White with renewed respect when Sua approached.\n\n\"Impressive. You barely flinched when Ung hit you.\" Her eyes traced the contours of his armor with professional interest. \"Did you craft this yourself?\"\n\nGrid's survival wasn't solely due to Triple Layers, though he couldn't explain that. With **1,500 stamina**, his minimum defense rivaled tankers in the mid-200s. But Sua couldn't know that—from her perspective, a blacksmith having such physical resilience defied common sense. She naturally attributed his durability to the armor alone.\n\n\"I made it,\" Grid confirmed.\n\n*Chwaruruk!*\n\nHe straightened, letting the armor catch the light. Hundreds of black scales rippled across his chest like living obsidian, each piece flowing seamlessly into the next. A masterwork.\n\nSua studied him for a moment longer. \"Fine. I won't stop you. But if you want to keep that body intact, you'll follow our orders in there. Understood?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nGrid nodded, though he paid little attention to the warning. Sua had been nothing but courteous since they'd met, her concern genuine. He had no reason to take offense.\n\n*Not that it matters. I'll do what needs doing regardless.*\n\nThe Red Phoenix Group might be elite, but once they entered the dungeon, the armored needles would consume their attention. They wouldn't have the luxury of monitoring him.\n\n*Still, no need to make enemies.*\n\nConsidering the East Continent's reputation and the armored needles' strength, the Red Phoenix Group likely exceeded even the Red Knights in skill. Fourth advancement classes weren't out of the question. These weren't people he wanted to antagonize.\n\n*I should observe them with the Great Lord's Sword. Any real talent gets recruited to Reidan.*\n\nWhile Grid plotted, the team completed their preparations. One by one, they approached the well and dropped into its depths without hesitation.\n\n\"Let's go,\" Sua said.\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nThey were the last pair remaining.\n\n\"Please be careful.\" Her hand brushed his arm—a fleeting touch, protective in its gentleness.\n\nGrid smiled. *Her sense of responsibility is incredible.*\n\nIt wasn't just the tender contact that warmed him. He genuinely appreciated her concern.\n\n***\n\n> [You have entered Pangea's Castle Dungeon.]\n>\n> [The inner walls absorb all light. Torches and illumination magic are ineffective.]\n>\n> [Your field of view has been severely restricted.]\n>\n> [This is a physical phenomenon and cannot be resisted.]\n>\n> [You can only see within 5 meters of your position.]\n\n*Worse than the vampire dungeons.*\n\nAn absolute darkness pressed in from all sides—the kind that offered no adaptation, no matter how long you waited. Grid reached out to gauge the dungeon's dimensions, his fingers seeking the wall. Instead, they brushed across warm skin.\n\n\"*Haaack!*\"\n\nA strangled groan erupted beside him. A bearded man in his forties—Ryu—flushed crimson as his legs buckled beneath him.\n\n\"Hey, Ryu! I know you've got stamina, but there's a time and place!\"\n\n\"Doing something so shameless on a mission...\"\n\n\"And with Captain Sua right here...\"\n\nThe Red Phoenix members erupted in scandalized whispers.\n\nRyu staggered, barely keeping his feet. \"I was just *walking!* Nothing happened!\"\n\n\"Walking makes you sound like *that?*\"\n\n\"Something touched my wrist! That's all!\"\n\nSilence.\n\nSua's lips quirked. \"Your body is remarkably sensitive.\"\n\nShame colored Ryu's face as he stared at the ground. Sua watched him with the fascination of a cat eyeing a particularly interesting fish.\n\n*Pervert,* Grid thought.\n\nMaybe Sua wasn't his type after all.\n\n*Then again, even gentle Irene becomes a beast in bed...*\n\nHow much wilder would someone like Sua be?\n\n*Better keep my hands to myself.*\n\nSince he could only indulge once a month, Grid clasped his hands behind his back and swallowed hard.\n\n*Flash!*\n\nGrid's heightened **Insight** caught a glimmer in the darkness before anyone else noticed.\n\n*Thread?*\n\nThe passage was wide enough for five armored soldiers to march abreast. Across one of the branching paths, thread spread like a massive spider's web, suddenly glinting in the dark.\n\n*Silver thread?*\n\nRealization struck.\n\n\"Armored needle!\"\n\nThe Red Phoenix Group spotted it a heartbeat later. Bows appeared, arrows nocked and aimed at every passage except the one blocked by shimmering silver.\n\n*Step. Step.*\n\nFootsteps echoed from the darkness.\n\n\"Here it comes!\"\n\n*Pik!*\n\n*Pipipipipit!*\n\nArrows flew in perfect unison—swift and deadly accurate.\n\n*Puk!*\n\n*Puuoooook!*\n\n\"*Kuwaaaah!*\"\n\nA scream tore through the passage. Every arrow had found its mark.\n\n*Impressive.*\n\nTracking an invisible target by sound alone and hitting it with that precision...\n\n*What's their Bow Mastery level?*\n\nWhile Grid marveled, Sua pressed something into his hand—a yellow talisman.\n\n\"I won't be able to protect you during the fight. Take this.\"\n\n> [Protection Talisman acquired.]\n>\n> [When carried, negates one enemy attack. This effect can only be used once.]\n>\n> [After negating an attack, **Defense** increases by 20% for two minutes.]\n>\n> [Item disappears after use.]\n\n*A one-time invincibility item?*\n\nShame it was consumable, but the effect was incredible. In PvP or raid scenarios, this would be priceless—assuming it was tradeable.\n\n*Wait...*\n\nGrid's excitement deflated.\n\n*Untradeable. Can't even store it in my pet inventory.*\n\nHis dreams of future profit evaporated.\n\n*Probably going to burn it in this dungeon anyway.*\n\nHe clicked his tongue softly.\n\n\"*Kuwaaah!*\"\n\nFour armored needles emerged from the darkness, arrows jutting from their bodies. Zombies wearing bamboo hats, silver armor melting into their decayed blood vessels like liquid metal. The sight confirmed Grid's suspicion.\n\n*The armored needles' blood is hot enough to melt silver.*\n\nAvoid their blood when attacking. Noted.\n\n*The God Hand will need to handle this.*\n\n*Chaaeng!*\n\n*Chaeeeeeng!*\n\nThe Red Phoenix members engaged with practiced efficiency. Their swordsmanship exceeded even their archery—fluid, precise, lethal. But the armored needles were undead. Pain meant nothing. Fear meant nothing. They pressed forward despite accumulating wounds, fighting with mindless ferocity.\n\n*Peeeeeong!*\n\nThe armored needles' strikes combined brutal power with shocking speed. The Red Phoenix members couldn't evade—only defend, forced back step by step. Some stumbled. Others fell.\n\n*Still...*\n\nIn Grid's assessment, the armored needles were outmatched.\n\nThe Red Phoenix Group's combat experience and superior stats showed. No fourth advancement classes, surprisingly, but their numerical advantage allowed them to systematically contain the threat. The armored needles seemed unlikely to inflict serious damage.\n\nThen everything changed.\n\n*Chwarururuk!*\n\n\"Incoming!\"\n\nThe armored needles' bodies swelled grotesquely as they extracted silver thread from their own rotting blood vessels. The threads lashed out like serpents, transforming the battle.\n\n\"*Ugh!*\"\n\nThe Red Phoenix members scrambled to adapt. Silver thread whipped through the air from every direction, forcing them into desperate defense. Sweat gleamed on their faces as they struggled to protect vital areas.\n\n*How durable is that material?*\n\nThe instant the armored needles deployed their thread weapons, the tide shifted. The Red Phoenix Group lost all offensive momentum, fully occupied with survival.\n\n*Definitely tricky.*\n\nEach armored needle wielded between eight and fifteen strands of silver thread, each strand stretching ten meters. They controlled every strand with terrifying precision, creating a web of lethal whips.\n\n*Can't dodge that. God Hand will be essential.*\n\nMaybe Regas or Faker could navigate that storm of blades, but no one else here stood a chance.\n\n*Jjejejeok!*\n\n*Pepepepeong!*\n\nThe silver thread proved devastatingly strong. When it clashed with a Red Phoenix member's sword, the impact launched them airborne before slamming them into walls like bullets.\n\n*Acts like a blade, then a whip...*\n\nThe durability was remarkable—no damage despite repeated contact with weapons and armor. No wonder East Continent blacksmiths prized silver thread above all other materials.\n\n*It's like pavranium in thread form. What could I create with this?*\n\nGrid's imagination raced with possibilities while the Red Phoenix Group's situation deteriorated.\n\n\"More coming!\"\n\nThe silver thread barrier served two purposes: preventing escape and buying time. Time for *fusion.*\n\nThe sight that emerged was nightmarish.\n\nMultiple armored needles merged via silver thread, becoming singular entities with no loss of mobility. Seamless unions created war-optimized monsters sporting four, six, even eight limbs.\n\n\"*Kyaaaaaah!*\"\n\nAn inhuman roar erupted from beyond the thread barrier.\n\n\"Everyone retreat!\" Sua shouted.\n\nShe'd never faced four armored needles simultaneously. But when the Red Phoenix members tried to fall back, more silver thread erupted from the passage behind Grid, cutting off their escape.\n\n\"No—!\"\n\nPanic rippled through the group. One fused armored needle with four limbs, five regular ones charging from ahead—death approaching from both sides. Sua's face hardened with determination. As captain and Han Seokbong's successor, she couldn't allow her team—or Grid—to die here. She launched forward without hesitation, placing herself between the monsters and her people.\n\n\"I'll buy you time! *Run!*\"\n\n\"Captain!\"\n\n\"My lady!\"\n\nThey couldn't stop her. Sua was the fastest among them, already in the midst of the enemy formation.\n\nBut Grid stood beside her.\n\n\"You!?\"\n\n*What is this blacksmith doing?* Sua's mind reeled. *I sacrificed myself so he could escape!*\n\nThen Grid moved.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship.\"\n\nEnergy surged around him as he completed the sword dance, +9 Failure gleaming in his grip.\n\n\"**Wave.**\"\n\n*Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!*\n\nBrilliant light erupted from the blade, tearing through the suffocating darkness like dawn breaking over a battlefield."
