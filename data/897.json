  "content": "Grid's jaw set as he studied his opponent across the garden. The same intensity that had gripped him during the PvP finals against Kraugel returned—not because Damian posed an equal threat, but because underestimating the Pope would be a mistake.\n\nEven with Grid's perfect record against him, Damian remained dangerous when fully buffed. His unique class as Goddess' Agent, combined with his papal authority, made him one of the strongest players in Satisfy. More importantly, his arsenal of buffs could match Grid's firepower in extended exchanges.\n\n*Goddess' Wrath is the real problem.* Once those twin magic circles materialized, Grid would need to avoid direct confrontation. The spell's pillars of light hit like anti-tank rounds—devastating and unforgiving. Previously, the God Hands had made victory straightforward, but...\n\n*I don't have them anymore.*\n\nThe weight of that sacrifice pressed on him. He'd given up Sword Mastery, his blacksmithing growth potential, and the God Hands themselves to forge something new. Now he needed to confirm whether the trade had been worth it.\n\n*On paper, the sword outperforms the God Hands. But theory and practice are different beasts.*\n\nMore than anything, he hoped the new pavranium form would prove superior. The Blacksmith Hammer to Go Against the Gods had already won his heart—its ability to guarantee myth-rated items while eliminating normal and rare failures was revolutionary.\n\n*The difference is night and day.*\n\nFor someone who invested countless hours, gold, and materials into each creation, producing a normal or rare item felt like a curse. The wasted potential made him physically ill. With the hammer, he could ensure every piece reached at least epic quality. That security was intoxicating.\n\n*But if my combat effectiveness drops to boost my crafting... that's a problem. I need to be careful.*\n\nGrid drew a steady breath and pressed the Pulling Device's button. The Enlightenment Blade—tethered by silver thread—whirled to life, orbiting him in a blur of ivory light. Dozens of rotations per second created a defensive sphere that made Damian tense. The components locked together mid-flight, assembling into a seamless sword.\n\nDamian's face had already lost color. The memory of being dismantled by the Enlightenment Sword haunted him, and that fear crept back now. His shoulders hunched as his fighting spirit wavered.\n\n\"We're with you, Your Holiness!\"\n\n\"May Goddess Rebecca bless your blade!\"\n\nBut retreat wasn't an option—not after accepting this duel in front of hundreds of church members. How could he show weakness now?\n\n\"Your Holiness...\"\n\n\"Isabel...\"\n\nShe stood among the crowd, and her presence alone rekindled his determination. He wanted to be someone worthy in her eyes. Even if victory was impossible, he could at least demonstrate his resolve.\n\n*Watch me. I'll show you what I'm made of.* The thought burned in his gaze as he found her in the crowd.\n\n\"Please don't push yourself too hard. I don't want to see you hurt.\" Isabel's gentle voice carried genuine concern—but also a tacit acknowledgment that Grid outclassed him completely.\n\nDamian knew she was right.\n\n*Still... that stings a little.*\n\nHe wanted to be the strongest for the woman he loved. That desire reignited the flames in his chest.\n\n\"Divine Protection. Incarnation of Light. Goddess' Blessing.\"\n\n[Divine Protection increases defense of you and your party by 30% for 5 minutes.]\n\n[Incarnation of Light increases attack power of you and your party by 20% for 5 minutes.]\n\n[Goddess' Blessing increases all stats by 15% for 7 minutes, negates one strike, and creates a shield absorbing 12,000 damage.]\n\n*Flash! Flash! Flash!*\n\nRadiance enveloped Damian as buffs layered upon buffs. His skills had improved significantly since the 3rd National Competition—natural growth from constant use. And though that growth might poison him in this matchup, it was enough to stir the Hero King's blood.\n\n[You have discovered a strong person of this era!]\n\n[The Hero King's fighting energy has begun to boil!]\n\nAs Damian's power swelled, the crimson and violet aura surrounding Grid intensified, darkening to a deeper hue. Damian's eyes widened.\n\n\"This won't be easy!\"\n\nConscious of Isabel watching, Damian refused to surrender his spirit. A miniature golden circle manifested above his left shoulder—like a scaled-down version of Goddess' Wrath's signature sigils.\n\n*Is that—?*\n\nBefore Grid could finish the thought, light erupted from the circle. Goddess' Anger possessed only a quarter of Goddess' Wrath's destructive power, but its constant uptime and low resource cost made it a persistent threat. The flash struck Grid's position dead-on. The explosion sent shockwaves rippling through the garden, and several Rebecca followers stumbled.\n\n\"Are you insane?\" The elders' voices rose in immediate protest. \"Your Holiness! Why attack so suddenly? Don't you dare kill him!\"\n\n\"Wait, he's—\"\n\nWhen had the Pope become the villain? When had the elders grown so fond of Grid? Confusion and cold sweat mingled on Damian's face. Then smoke cleared from the blast site.\n\nGrid stood unharmed.\n\n*How?*\n\nGoddess' Anger's efficient mana cost came with guaranteed minimum damage. Even with Grid's magic resistance, the spell should have dealt at least 7,000 fixed damage. Damian couldn't comprehend what he was seeing.\n\n\"What...?\"\n\n\"Is that—?\"\n\nDamian's confusion mirrored the elders' shock—though they maintained composure befitting their station. The ordinary church members, however, gaped openly. Something impossible was unfolding before them.\n\nAn exquisite ivory blade floated independently in the air, positioned defensively before Grid.\n\nA sword had replaced the God Hands.\n\n*What is that thing?*\n\nPavranium remained Pagma's Descendant's exclusive secret. Its hidden functions and transformations were unknown to outsiders. Neither Damian nor the church members could recognize that this blade had been forged from the God Hands themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, Grid analyzed the Blade Aiming at the Gods with clinical precision.\n\n*Reaction speed matches the God Hands exactly.*\n\nThat made sense. Pavranium's protective reflexes and enemy response time remained constant whether configured as discs, hands, or blades. The consistency was expected. But one detail surprised him.\n\n*Its damage threshold increased?*\n\nPavranium would temporarily freeze after absorbing damage beyond a certain limit, losing functionality until recovery. The discs and God Hands had locked up for one second after taking 10,000 damage or more. Yet the blade had just tanked that much and remained active.\n\n*Is it because the blade uses more pavranium than the God Hands? Or is this from combining it with other minerals?*\n\nProbably both. Satisfaction curved Grid's lips as he called out, \"Is that the best you've got? Try a real attack.\"\n\nGrid's insight had sharpened considerably. He'd noticed Damian's awareness of Isabel in the crowd—and knew exactly how to exploit it.\n\n\"If that's what you want!\" As predicted, Damian took the bait, eager to impress. On a real battlefield, Grid would be grinning. Two massive magic circles—three meters in diameter each—materialized above Damian's shoulders. Grid recognized the formation immediately. The Pope's ultimate technique was coming.\n\n\"Goddess' Wrath!\"\n\nDamian triggered only one circle initially. A colossal pillar of light erupted forth and engulfed Grid. The scale dwarfed Goddess' Anger completely. Shockwaves rippled through the entire garden, knocking church members off their feet.\n\n\"Have you lost your mind?\" The elders erupted in outrage, directing their fury at Damian for unleashing such devastation on the church's benefactor.\n\n\"Too late to worry about that now!\" Damian dismissed their protests, eyes locked forward.\n\nThe light pillar crashed against the ivory blade. The Pope's strongest technique met its match and dissipated. As the brilliance faded, the blade hung frozen in midair, trembling.\n\nGrid's smile widened. *30,000 damage.*\n\nThe Blade Aiming at the Gods only froze when absorbing 30,000 damage or more. That was 20,000 higher than the God Hands' threshold.\n\n\"Not bad at all... wait—\"\n\nThe blade remained frozen. Damian seized the opening. Light erupted from the second massive magic circle, streaking toward Grid.\n\n*Damn!*\n\nThe blade was still locked. Taking this hit—at minimum 70,000 damage—would be catastrophic.\n\n*...Hold on.* Grid's hand stopped mid-swing. Instead of using the Enlightenment Sword to deflect, he yanked the Blacksmith Hammer to Go Against the Gods from his inventory. The hammer intercepted the flash an instant before it struck his chest.\n\n\"Hah...!\" Grid laughed aloud. Of course—the hammer was also pavranium. Without missing a beat, he launched into a sword dance. Transcend's movements flowed through him. The air around Grid ignited. His attack power surged, and every strike transformed into a ranged assault.\n\n\"Gah!\"\n\nThis was broken! Damian excelled at close combat, but now Grid soared away, raining attacks from the sky. Damian hunched behind his shield like a turtle, attempting to close the distance. Unlike Grid—who moved freely while striking—Damian had to fire magic from cover, tanking his accuracy. His shield pointed upward, angled like a wall to block the relentless barrage.\n\nWhich left his flank completely exposed.\n\nThe Blade Aiming at the Gods pierced through unguarded space.\n\n[You have suffered 8,170 damage.]\n\n\"Guh—?\"\n\nGrid hadn't even swung it. The blade moved autonomously. Despite using only its base attack power, it dealt devastating damage to fully buffed Damian—comparable to Grid's direct strikes.\n\nChills ran down Damian's spine.\n\n\"Link.\"\n\nGrid used Freely Move to materialize at Damian's side, launching into his swordsmanship. \n\n\"W-Wait! Time out!\" Damian cried, but Grid ignored him. Mid-sword dance, the Enlightenment Blade detached and the Blade Aiming at the Gods locked into place.\n\nThe Sword Aiming at the Gods was born.\n\n\"It's just sparring mode—dying doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"That's not the point...!\"\n\nDamian's urgent protest fell on deaf ears. Grid had too many variables left to test. Stopping now would be wasteful. Grid's sword descended. Lightning cracked from the heavens over Damian's head as golden clouds manifested above.\n\nA transparent God Hand materialized around Grid.\n\nStill feeling incomplete, Grid turned to the stunned elders. \"Elders, would you mind joining? Help His Holiness spar against me—\"\n\nThey shook their heads frantically. Terror filled their eyes as they looked between the unscathed Grid and the battered Damian on the ground.\n\n*We cannot anger him...!* In their minds, Grid's presence had swollen to rival the Goddess herself.\n\nIt wouldn't be long before Grid earned another point in his deity stat."
