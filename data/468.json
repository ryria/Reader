  "content": "Huroi scaled the sand wall and froze. The battlefield sprawled below him—a chaos of steel and blood.\n\n\"This is completely different from what we expected,\" he said.\n\nPeak Sword pulled himself up beside him, boots scraping against compacted sand. \"This is serious.\"\n\nPon emerged last, his face darkening as he surveyed the carnage. The three men stood on the wall, watching invaders butcher Siren's defenders.\n\nPeak Sword's jaw tightened. \"One thousand players. Average level mid-200s.\"\n\n\"Thirty third advancement classes.\" Pon's knuckles whitened around his spear shaft. \"Not rabble. Combat specialists.\"\n\nThey spoke with practiced calm, but their eyes tracked every movement below—cataloging equipment, analyzing formations, measuring skill rotations. Then something in the center of the battlefield caught their attention.\n\n\"What the hell?\" Peak Sword leaned forward.\n\nPon squinted. \"Regas is losing?\"\n\n\"Who's that woman?\" Huroi's voice dropped.\n\nRegas had charged in first with Katz. None of them had worried—Regas was a monster. He'd gone toe-to-toe with Damian in PvP. If Kraugel and Grid were SSS-tier, Regas was SS-tier. The man could fight naked and survive.\n\nBut this...\n\nA massive woman with white hair moved like water, flowing around Regas's strikes. Every exchange left him slower, more defensive. She outmatched him in stats, skill, and control. Regas, the Taekwon Master, was getting beaten.\n\n*White.* The ID hung above her head.\n\n\"Where has someone like that been hiding?\" Peak Sword breathed.\n\n*She's Kraugel-tier.* The realization settled over them like a shroud. When Kraugel first emerged, people thought he was an NPC—no player could be that strong. Now White appeared from nowhere, showing that same impossible dominance.\n\nPon's lips curved into a grin. His hands trembled.\n\nPeak Sword glanced at him. \"Don't even think about it.\"\n\n\"A new peak to climb.\" Pon's voice came out rough. *Just like Kraugel. A wall to overcome.* His blood sang with anticipation—the same rush Regas must be feeling while fighting her. This was what they lived for.\n\n\"I'm joining Regas.\" Pon stepped forward.\n\nPeak Sword's hand clamped on his shoulder. \"No small fries down there. Every single one is dangerous.\"\n\nHuroi nodded. \"I understand the urge, but our job is reducing their numbers while Regas holds that monster's attention. We minimize casualties until reinforcements arrive.\"\n\n\"Personal grudges come later,\" Peak Sword added.\n\nPon exhaled slowly, reining himself in. He pulled out his spear. \"Fine. But I can at least help Regas from here.\"\n\nHis right arm began to swell. Muscle fibers bulged beneath skin, twisting at impossible angles. The bones creaked.\n\nPeak Sword grimaced. *That looks like hell.*\n\nMany skills demanded payment—pain, health, physical deformation. Rail Spear required all three. The penalty was brutal.\n\nThe reward matched it.\n\n**Peeeeong!**\n\nThe spear vanished. Three hundred meters away, White screamed. The projectile punched through her back, erupting from her sternum in a spray of red.\n\nRegas seized the opening, gasping for air. He shot a thumbs-up toward the wall.\n\n\"That idiot actually thanked you.\" Huroi blinked. \"I expected him to rage about interference.\"\n\n\"That woman is really strong,\" Peak Sword said quietly.\n\nThe tension crystallized. All three men felt it now—the weight of what they were facing.\n\nBlood Carnival members turned. Heads swiveled toward the wall. Recognition flashed across faces.\n\n\"Pon!\"\n\n\"Peak Sword!\"\n\n\"Overgeared?\"\n\n\"Kill them!\"\n\nThe element of surprise died. Pon's Rail Spear had painted a target on their backs.\n\nThe three exchanged glances. Then moved.\n\n\"Our Yura is prettier!\" Huroi's voice boomed across the battlefield, wrapping allies in his Orator's aura.\n\nPeak Sword's hand dropped to his sword hilt. The <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Ideal Longsword</span> caught the light inside Grid's custom sheath.\n\n\"Draw Sword.\"\n\n**Piing.**\n\nWhite light erupted.\n\n\"Sudden.\"\n\n**Kwa kwa kwa kwang!**\n\nThe sword drew. A crescent of energy tore through the charging players. Bodies fell—everyone except the third advancement users died in that single strike.\n\nPeak Sword exhaled through his teeth.\n\nPon spurred his horse forward. The white stallion plunged down the cliff face, hooves finding impossible purchase. His spear became a blur. Two players fell. Three more. Every straight charge left corpses.\n\nWater Clan civilians stumbled back, tears streaming down their faces. A young boy clutched his mother's body, refusing to move.\n\nPon's eyes sharpened. \"Fall into misery.\"\n\n\"Stop him!\" someone screamed.\n\nBlood Carnival members converged, desperation twisting their features. Strength was relative. White saw Pon as prey. The attackers saw Pon as death itself.\n\n***\n\nBlack's head reformed. Skin knitted over exposed bone. Eyes rolled back into their sockets.\n\n\"I've seen immortality skills,\" Euphemina said. \"But resurrection? That's new.\" She tilted her head, studying Black like an insect. \"Is it your class? An item? A title? Whatever it is, I want it.\"\n\n\"Hiit! Yihihihit!\" Black's laughter rattled.\n\nFour minutes, thirty-one seconds for the first kill. Five minutes, twenty seconds for the second. Euphemina's hand settled on Black's skull—soft fingers, pleasant scent. Beneath the perfume, Black smelled death.\n\n**Peeok!**\n\n*Retribution.* C-grade magic. Distance-dependent power scaling. At point-blank range, it hit like B-grade.\n\nBlack's head exploded.\n\nEuphemina verified the kill notification, then pulled in a breath. \"Resurrecting twice should be impossible.\"\n\nA whisper pinged from Huroi. *Finally.* Her guildmates had reached Siren. She could regroup, coordinate, minimize civilian casualties—\n\n\"Hiit! Yihihihit! Are you getting weaker?\"\n\nEuphemina's head snapped around.\n\nBlack stood ten feet away. Pristine. Whole. Grinning.\n\n*Not resurrection. Something higher.*\n\n\"You're like a cockroach.\" Euphemina's hands blazed with magic power.\n\nThe spell detonated. Shockwaves rippled outward, collapsing a nearby building into rubble.\n\nEuphemina winced. *Protect the civilians AND the infrastructure.* Her quest had two conditions. Property damage counted against her.\n\nSkills burning through cooldowns. Mana draining. Stamina flagging. Her thoughts drifted to Grid.\n\nHeat flooded her cheeks. She shook her head violently. *No feelings. Just tactical assessment. That's all.*\n\n\"Hiit? Uhit?\"\n\nBlack stared at her—the blushing mage standing alone on a battlefield.\n\n*I'm being called weird by a psychopath.* The indignation sharpened Euphemina's focus.\n\n***\n\nLauel's fingers drummed against his armrest. Reports from the advance team painted a grim picture.\n\n*Thirty unofficial rankers. Multiple sun-grade users.* He closed his eyes. *Blood Carnival.*\n\nNot just comparable to the seven great guilds. Potentially equal to Overgeared itself. The attackers weren't random mercenaries—they were apex predators.\n\n*I didn't want this enemy.* Blood Carnival answered only to money and violence. No morality. No restraint. Making them hostile would be exhausting.\n\nJishuka caught his expression and smiled. \"Don't worry. We crush them hard enough, they'll be too scared to touch us again.\"\n\nLauel laughed, but the sound came out hollow. \"Right. Break them so thoroughly they never come back.\"\n\nInside, doubt gnawed at him. White was sun-tier. Kraugel-class.\n\n*Should've brought Faker.* He'd judged eight members plus Euphemina sufficient to save Siren. The attackers were players, after all—how strong could they be?\n\nHe'd miscalculated. Blood Carnival represented the worst two billion users had to offer.\n\n*This will be brutal. If only Grid—*\n\nWhy wasn't Grid answering his phone?\n\nLauel reached for his communicator when a notification flashed.\n\n> [Master 'Grid' is connected.]\n\n***\n\nVirtual reality worked through brain-to-server transmission. Thoughts became actions. The lag was minimal—point-one seconds in modern systems.\n\nGrid's ancient capsule had lagged three-tenths of a second. An eternity in combat. He'd never cared about the delay, never considered upgrading. It was just how the game felt.\n\nThen came the National Competition. Suddenly his hands moved when he thought them to. Words emerged the instant he spoke them. The difference was subtle but disorienting.\n\nAnd now—\n\nGrid's eyes widened.\n\n*No lag.* His body responded like reality itself. Thought and action collapsed into simultaneity.\n\n*The diamond capsule. Best sync rate.* The phrase from the manual clicked into place.\n\nA grin split his face. \"I can please Irene even more!\"\n\nFaster hip movements. Better manual dexterity. Enhanced—\n\n*[Content Omitted]*\n\nGrid was halfway to Irene's chambers when a whisper pinged.\n\n*Lauel?*"
