Ttang...*\n\nThe rhythmic hammering echoed through the forest as dawn's gray light filtered through the canopy.\n\nMercedes watched Grid work, sweat gleaming on his brow despite the cool morning air. She shook her head sharply, trying to dispel the questions circling her mind like vultures.\n\nWhy did he have Lorex's axe? Where had those armor sets come from?\n\nYesterday, she'd seen him feed both the red plate and the massive axe into his portable furnace. Her imagination had conjured a dozen scenarios, each more troubling than the last. But even as her chest tightened with doubt, she knew better than to let suspicion take root.\n\nThe worst had already happened, after all. Nothing Grid could have done would match what she'd already endured.\n\nEven if he *was* the Undefeated King's descendant—the warrior who'd butchered Red Knights during the Empire's war with Valhalla—what right did she have to feel betrayed?\n\n*The Empire threatens the Overgeared Kingdom's very survival.*\n\nThat threat hadn't diminished. If Grid had struck against the Empire, weakened it, bled it... those were the natural actions of a king protecting his realm. And regardless of whether he deserved blame, Mercedes served *him* now. Her duty demanded she understand his past, embrace it—not wield it as a weapon against him.\n\nStill, one regret lingered.\n\n*If Lorex had known about Grid's connection to Piaro...*\n\nPerhaps he'd still be alive. Perhaps he'd be standing guard at her side right now, serving the Overgeared Kingdom. But history didn't traffic in \"perhaps.\" The dead stayed dead, and speculation changed nothing.\n\n*It's not worth dwelling on.*\n\nMercedes drew a steadying breath, forcing her thoughts to settle—when a faint sound reached her ears.\n\nHer blood went cold.\n\n*What?*\n\nSomething had approached. In this empty clearing. While she'd been lost in her own head.\n\nShame flooded through her as she sprang to her feet, spinning with her sword already drawn. The blade rang against something solid, metal on chitin, and the sharp clash made her ears ring.\n\nPiaro shot upright at the disturbance. His eyes widened.\n\nA cave cricket the size of a small house loomed over Mercedes, its massive form blotting out the dawn light.\n\nAncient species—creatures that had prowled the world since its beginning. Humanity's expansion had driven them from their homes, erased them from recorded history. But here, in the World Tree's forest, they endured.\n\n\"Urgh!\" Mercedes stumbled backward, her defensive stance barely formed.\n\nThe creature possessed eight legs in total. Two stubby forelimbs. Four razor-sharp side legs that served as both shield and spear. Two powerful hindlegs built for devastating leaps. Its combat style defied human comprehension—a predator refined by tens of thousands of years of evolution.\n\nMercedes spread her silver wings and launched herself skyward, desperate to escape the relentless assault.\n\nThe cricket's antennae tracked her motion with unnerving precision.\n\nIts legs lashed out. The blow caught her mid-flight, and blood sprayed from her lips as she hurtled through the air.\n\n\"Ku...ock!\"\n\nThe arrogance of calling this thing an *insect* never crossed her mind. This was no mere bug. Its carapace put wyvern scales to shame. Its strength exceeded even the bear-wolves she'd fought in daylight. And its attacks came from angles that made prediction impossible.\n\nThis wasn't a mindless beast. This was something *more.*\n\nThe ground collapsed inward as the cricket coiled its hindlegs. Earth and stone compressed under its weight. Then it *launched.*\n\n\"Mercedes! Wake up!\"\n\nPiaro's shout cut through her shock as she stared at the creature suspended impossibly high above.\n\n\"Growth!\"\n\nThe trees Piaro had been pruning all day surged upward. Severed branches regrew in seconds, exploding with lush foliage. The massive canopy intercepted the cricket's descent, tangling it in a cage of wood.\n\nLimbs shattered as the cricket tore through the obstruction, its legs carving devastation through Piaro's instant forest.\n\nMercedes snapped back to herself. White sword energy blazed along her twin blades as she gathered her strength.\n\nPiaro didn't hesitate. \"Pounding Mortar!\"\n\nA colossal weight manifested above the struggling cricket and *dropped.* The impact shook the ground like an earthquake.\n\n\"Pledge Sword!\" Mercedes dove forward on silver wings, her blades finding the creature's softer underbelly in a blur of strikes.\n\nTwo legends who'd faced down Great Demons themselves. Two legends fighting as one.\n\nIt wasn't enough.\n\n\"Uh!\"\n\n\"Ha!\"\n\nThe cricket weathered their combined assault. Its only weakness was sunlight—at night, in the darkness before dawn, it reigned as the supreme predator it had been since the world's birth. Power equivalent to a lord of Hell coiled in that chitinous frame.\n\n\"This thing...\" Mercedes caught sight of the carnage beyond the shattered trees. Bear-wolf corpses, dozens of them, torn apart and scattered.\n\nThe cricket's trail of destruction.\n\nNow it had found new prey. Small, soft, *delicious* prey.\n\nUnderstanding flooded Mercedes' insight. The creature's pure predatory drive crystallized in her mind, and suddenly its movements became fractionally more readable.\n\nPiaro was already adapting his strategy. \"Hold it. I need space to work. Buy me time to prepare the field.\"\n\n\"Understood!\" Mercedes threw herself sideways as the cricket's forelimbs smashed down where she'd stood. Each impact sent tremors through the clearing.\n\nThe rock where Grid worked with his anvil and portable furnace shuddered violently. Looked ready to collapse.\n\nGrid never looked up.\n\nFrom the moment the cricket had appeared until now, he hadn't shown the slightest reaction. It would be an exaggeration to say he didn't even notice the battle raging around him.\n\nExcept it wasn't an exaggeration at all.\n\nGrid existed in another world entirely—one containing only himself, his hammer, the anvil, the flames, and the metal.\n\n*I feel it.*\n\nThe ogre bones had been tempered to their absolute ideal, every ounce of potential drawn forth. Black mithril surged in response, its fighting energy awakening. Rosar tin flowed between them, harmonizing, balancing.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nHis hammering grew more precise as his concentration deepened. Blacksmith's Patience and Blacksmith's Breath stacked endlessly, reinforcing both smith and metal beyond mortal limits.\n\nFinally—\n\n*Now!*\n\nHe saw the endpoint.\n\n[You have completed the item production!]\n\n[The Blacksmith God is very surprised. He says that his skill has once again been overtaken by a human.]\n\n[The other gods are laughing at the nervousness of the Blacksmith God.]\n\n[Affinity with the Blacksmith God has decreased by 1.]\n\n[If affinity with the Blacksmith God reaches -10, any items made (above Legendary rating) will be cursed.]\n\n[Current affinity with the Blacksmith God is -2.]\n\nThe full plate gleamed in the firelight—red in one angle, purple from another. Light danced across its flawless surface.\n\nHero King's Armor.\n\n***\n\nSilver flames wreathed Mercedes' swords. She couldn't hold anything back against this ancient predator—this thing that defied every category of human understanding.\n\nThe cricket fought with pure, overwhelming force. Transcendent leaps from hindlegs powerful enough to pulverize stone. Lightning-fast strikes from flexible forelimbs harder than steel. Antennae and side legs that eliminated every blind spot.\n\nA creature *designed* for killing.\n\nMercedes felt like a soldier throwing herself against a fortress wall. The gap in power was immense. Even with White Tiger's Attitude active, wounds accumulated across her body.\n\nPiaro continued farming, reshaping the battlefield. *Just a little longer!*\n\nHe needed perfect field control to restrain something this powerful. Three more minutes. No—please, just let her hold for *two* more minutes.\n\nTo Mercedes, two minutes stretched into eternity.\n\nWhite Tiger's Attitude shattered when the cricket's defensive legs suddenly switched to offense. They pierced straight through her guard, spearing into her sides.\n\nHer leather armor—unreplaced while Grid crafted her new set—had been failing from the start. Less armor than rags at this point.\n\nSix legs descended like rain. Four side legs and two forelimbs hammering down in a devastating combination. Cracks spider-webbed across the silver wings she'd wrapped protectively around herself. Dozens of hooked tips tore through, shredding the wing's surface.\n\nMercedes endured, but couldn't suppress the despair rising in her chest.\n\n*How fleeting is my existence?*\n\nA lifetime of worship and training. Praise as the continent's strongest knight. Ascension to the rank of legend.\n\nAll meaningless in the end.\n\nHumanity's legends were just *prey* for the ancient world. Her years of dedication, her resolve, her hopes for the future—wishful thinking, nothing more.\n\n*I'm sorry.*\n\nHer silver wings shattered like glass, fragments glittering as they fell. Mercedes gripped the White Tiger's Sword through the cascading remnants, clinging to her final mission: *protect her master's treasure.*\n\nTo buy just a few more seconds, she wrapped the blade in sword energy so intense her blue hair began to fade to white. In her last moments, she shone with ethereal beauty—moonlight given form.\n\nThe cricket's forelimbs descended toward her face.\n\n\"Fucking bug.\" The crude curse cut through the air—words Mercedes had never heard Grid speak. \"Why is an insect as strong as a Great Demon?\"\n\nGrid materialized between her and death, Lantier's Cloak billowing around him. Revolve activated, redirecting the massive strike.\n\nHe thrust armor into Mercedes' hands. \"Put it on. Now you'll be able to show your real strength.\"\n\nA wide grin split his face.\n\nBecause the cave cricket's name tag blazed *gold.* A raid boss. The rewards would be incredible.\n\n\"Noe! Randy! Can you Become the King of the Dead?\"\n\n\"Nyang!\"\n\n*Kyak kyak! Kya kya kyak!*\n\nGrid's full party manifested in Piaro's cleared field, ready for war.\n\n***\n\nSimultaneously, at S.A. Group headquarters, the operations team stared at their monitoring arrays.\n\n\"Maybe he'll actually hunt it?\"\n\n\"...Crazy. This is absolutely insane.\"\n\nYoon Nahee and her team watched the feeds in stunned silence.\n\nThe giant cave cricket was a disaster-class monster. It was *supposed* to decimate the elf population when the Multiple Species Episode launched. But variables named Overgeared King Grid and Merchant King Kir had derailed everything.\n\nNow it had become a raid target instead. Mercedes' presence changed the entire equation. Even for a legendary knight, managing to *fight* the cave cricket at all...\n\n*If Grid encounters Kir after this...*\n\nGrid would probably rescue the elves. Maintain their population. Which meant the Dark Elves Episode would collapse entirely.\n\n*The surviving members of the Twelve Te were supposed to fall to Yatan's temptation to balance the power structure...*\n\nHow many times had this happened now? She'd lost count of how often players had completely rewritten the scheduled narrative.\n\n\"Will it be okay?\" one team member asked nervously.\n\nYoon Nahee laughed. \"Have you forgotten the Chairman's message? Satisfy is a world where history is made by players. This isn't something we need to worry about.\"\n\nYes. All they could do was watch.\n\nAnd wonder who would emerge as the final victor in this endless, sprawling history."
