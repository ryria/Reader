  "content": "\"Murdered by his own son...\"\n\nThe words hit Grid like a physical blow. It seemed impossible—too cruel to exist outside of fiction. Yet history was rife with such horrors, wasn't it? Kinslaying. Patricide. Fratricide. The litany of blood-soaked family betrayals stretched back to antiquity.\n\n*Even legends aren't immune...*\n\nGrid had never been naturally talented. Everything he'd achieved—even his mediocre grades in school—came through sheer grinding effort. He'd memorized dates, battles, dynasties. History had been one of his better subjects precisely because it rewarded diligence over brilliance.\n\nNow that knowledge returned to him, cold and unforgiving.\n\n\"At least in the Overgeared Kingdom,\" Grid said quietly, \"I'll make sure tragedies like this never happen.\"\n\nHe didn't know the full story yet. But as both husband and father, the answer seemed obvious: love them. Respect them. Care for them. The same way his parents had raised him, the same way Sehee looked after him even now.\n\n*That's all it takes, right?*\n\nWarmth flickered through his chest at the thought. Then Sticks spoke again.\n\n\"Prince Rajandra didn't kill Madra out of hatred. His memoirs overflow with love and admiration for his father.\"\n\nGrid's head snapped up. \"What?\"\n\nLove? Admiration? Then why the hell would he—\n\n\"Madra believed he could defend Lubana forever,\" Sticks continued, his voice carefully neutral. \"But Prince Rajandra understood what his father refused to acknowledge: that Madra was mortal. That eventually, old age would claim him.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So Rajandra looked beyond his father's lifespan. Madra's very existence provoked the Empire into constant warfare. Every invasion made the Undefeated King's legend grow—but it was Lubana's people who bled for that glory. They were being ground to dust.\"\n\nGrid said nothing.\n\n\"Rajandra begged Madra to make peace. For the people. For Lubana's future. But Madra rejected every plea. He called his own son a coward and turned his back in disgust. Years passed. Madra's hair went white.\"\n\n\"And when death finally loomed...\"\n\n\"Rajandra's desperation reached its breaking point. The nobles, the knights, the soldiers—everyone understood what was coming. Once Madra died, the Empire would descend on Lubana like starving wolves. They begged Rajandra to act. So he did. Madra's head was delivered to the Empire as a peace offering.\"\n\nSilence stretched between them.\n\n\"In exchange,\" Sticks finished, \"the Lubana Kingdom became an imperial vassal state. But the royal family survived. The people lived. As for Madra's head...\" His expression darkened. \"They hung it from the gates of Titan for a full year.\"\n\n\"Christ.\" Grid's stomach churned. He imagined crowds jeering and spitting as they passed beneath the rotting head of a hero. What a miserable end for the Undefeated King—betrayed by his own blood, his corpse desecrated by the very empire he'd fought his entire life.\n\nYet even through the revulsion, Grid understood.\n\n*I can't condone what they did. But Madra... he couldn't see past his own strength. Couldn't imagine the perspective of the weak.*\n\nIf the old king had been less arrogant, less certain of his own invincibility, would things have ended differently?\n\n*It's just history now. Can't change what's done.*\n\nBut he could learn from it.\n\n*Never let strength blind you. Remember Madra.*\n\nGrid rose to his feet, eyes fixed on the gate leading to the sixty-sixth island.\n\n\"I'm going to give that poor bastard his first defeat.\"\n\n---\n\nEveryone knew Muller had been the strongest of his generation. Grid had heard the stories. But according to Sticks, the Behen Archipelago connected legends across eras—meaning there were titans who predated even Muller's time.\n\nLegends like Sword Saints and Great Magicians represented lineages stretching back centuries. But what about classes like Demon Slayer and Undefeated King? Alex had carved his path through a vendetta against Hell itself. Madra had pioneered his legend through sheer dominance—never losing, never bending. They were originals. Trailblazers like Piaro.\n\nWhich meant they might be even more formidable than the \"standard\" legends.\n\n*Alex's Hell Restriction was hard-countered by this place,* Grid reasoned. *But Madra? Nothing weakens the Undefeated King here.*\n\n*The final boss is always the strongest.*\n\nHis heart thundered as he stepped toward the sixty-sixth island. Anticipation sang through his veins. He was about to do what no one else ever had—defeat the man who'd never known defeat.\n\n---\n\n**Eat Spicy Jokbal, Haenam Branch, South Jeolla Province**\n\n\"Welcome!\"\n\nThe former leader of Blood Carnival—now owner of a pig's trotter restaurant—greeted his late-night customer with practiced enthusiasm. Most days, Dark (under his civilian identity) spent at least an hour at the shop, savoring his favorite food. There was something meditative about peeling apart hot, crispy jokbal piece by piece.\n\nThen his smile froze.\n\n\"Hmm. Slow night?\"\n\n\"...We do mostly delivery.\" Dark's voice went flat.\n\nPeak Sword stood in the doorway, hands in his pockets. The marquis visited once a week, like clockwork. Dark knew exactly why: to recruit him for the Overgeared Kingdom. A Dungeon Maker combined with Overgeared's resources would create something terrifying.\n\n*Of course they want me.*\n\n\"One makguksu.\"\n\nDark's eye twitched. \"Why do you come to a *jokbal restaurant* and order *noodles* every single time?\"\n\nHe'd named his restaurant *and* his game ID after jokbal because he genuinely, passionately loved the dish. Watching Peak Sword ignore it week after week felt like a personal insult.\n\nPeak Sword met his glare with complete sincerity. \"I don't like jokbal.\"\n\n\"You... *what?*\"\n\nDark's expression twisted into something demonic. But Peak Sword's face remained earnest—almost noble, like some patriotic martyr from the independence movement.\n\n\"I could lie,\" Peak Sword said. \"Pretend to love jokbal to win you over. But I want us to be genuine allies. So I'll be honest.\"\n\n*...Honest to the point of stupidity.*\n\nDespite himself, Dark felt something shift. This man knew about his dark past—knew he'd led a guild of bloodthirsty PKers—and still wanted him. Still came here every week. Still treated him with dignity.\n\nBut Dark kept his expression cold. \"Why don't you like jokbal?\"\n\nPeak Sword's answer was immediate. \"It's too expensive.\"\n\n\"*What?*\"\n\n\"Jokbal costs around thirty thousand won, right? But the portion? Barely enough for one person if you're actually hungry.\"\n\n\"...Who eats an entire jokbal by themselves?\"\n\n\"Someone with my metabolism.\" Peak Sword shook his head gravely. \"That's thirty to thirty-five thousand won for what amounts to maybe ten thousand won of meat. The markup is absurd.\"\n\nDark blinked. He'd expected some sophisticated culinary critique. Not... poverty trauma.\n\n\"What if,\" he said slowly, \"the jokbal was made with *handon?*\"\n\nPeak Sword went rigid. \"*Handon?*\"\n\nDomestic pork. In the twenty-second century, nearly all meat was imported—making Korean-raised pork worth its weight in gold. Peak Sword's composure cracked.\n\nDark smiled. \"Every piece of jokbal in my shop uses premium domestic pork. Still think thirty thousand won is expensive?\"\n\n\"You're not lying about the origin?\" Peak Sword's voice carried desperate hope.\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"...Fine!\" Peak Sword slammed a hand on the counter. \"Add one jokbal to that makguksu!\"\n\n\"Coming right up.\"\n\nAs Dark headed to the kitchen, he felt something unfamiliar: camaraderie. The Patriotic Association president was growing on him, one awkward visit at a time.\n\n*Maybe Overgeared isn't so bad...*\n\nThen the TV on the wall flickered with breaking news.\n\n『Breaking: A global notification has appeared to all Satisfy players. The contents...』\n\n**[A new hero has given peace to the specters of past heroes and has opened the final gate of the Behen Archipelago.]**\n\nThe message reached every player simultaneously. Most had no idea what the Behen Archipelago even was—only top rankers knew it existed. But the phrase \"final gate\" sparked immediate speculation across forums and streams.\n\nWho was this new hero?\n\n---\n\n**Elsewhere**\n\nAgnus paused mid-stride on his way to meet Empress Marie. \n\nThe quest she'd given him—*Build strength against the Five Pillars of the Empire*—represented his ticket to ultimate power. Marie had invested heavily in him, betting on his potential to support her son's claim to the throne.\n\nBut the world message changed everything.\n\n\"...Someone cleared the final gate?\"\n\nThat meant they'd beaten the sixty-second island—the same island where *he'd* been stopped cold. Demon Slayer Alex's Hell Restriction had hard-countered every death knight Agnus summoned. It had been an impossible fight.\n\nBut someone had won.\n\nAgnus' lips peeled back in a manic grin. \"Kikikik... of course it's you, Kraugel.\"\n\nIt had to be. Kraugel wielded the strongest combat class—no theoretical counter existed. Where Agnus had been shut down completely, Kraugel would have walked through.\n\n\"Kikikik! Fine! If it's you, I can accept it!\"\n\nThe death knights of past legends would've been nice. But Agnus didn't dwell. Marie's quest offered rewards potentially greater than anything on those islands.\n\nHe resumed walking.\n\n---\n\n**Near the Spear Saint's Territory**\n\n\"Who the hell reached the sixty-sixth island?\" Alexander's voice cracked with disbelief.\n\nHao shook his head slowly. \"I can't even imagine...\"\n\nThe world message had shaken them both. They'd assumed the Behen Archipelago existed solely for Kraugel—that only he possessed the strength to conquer it.\n\n*But someone else...*\n\nKraugel laughed at their stunned expressions. \"It's Grid.\"\n\n\"Grid...\"\n\nNeither man argued. They'd both witnessed Grid's duels at the Second National Competition and his monstrous performance against the Great Demon Belial. The evidence spoke for itself.\n\n\"Let's move,\" Kraugel said, already walking. \"Kirinus only appears once every three years. If we miss today, who knows when the next opportunity comes.\"\n\n\"Right!\"\n\nTalent and tenacity—these were what separated the elite from everyone else. Opportunities came to all. But only the relentless seized them."
