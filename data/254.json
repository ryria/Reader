  "content": "# Chapter 254\n\nHao, Master of the Hades Guild, represented China among Satisfy's elite. The guild he'd personally selected and trained possessed a strength that most underestimated due to their small numbers. Those who dismissed them simply didn't know better.\n\nThe Hades Guild's place among the seven great guilds was unquestionable. Their average level sat at 253, an overwhelming figure despite fielding only eighty members. A perfect unit of individuals bound by military hierarchy, their teamwork and tactical prowess placed them among the top combat forces in the game.\n\n*Kieek!*\n\n*Kyaak!*\n\nMoonlight bathed the night desert in pale silver. The Hades Guild marched without pause beneath Hao's command, their formation unwavering. Cold temperatures, treacherous sand, and aggressive monsters did nothing to slow their advance.\n\n> [System] Your level has risen.\n\nOne member grinned. \"Isn't this the best hunting ground on the continent?\"\n\n\"No wonder the Overgeared members' levels exploded,\" another agreed.\n\nThe desert spawned monsters over level 300, their experience yields exceeding expectations. The Hades Guild's levels climbed rapidly with each kill. Several members glanced at each other, silently agreeing they should remain here to grind.\n\nHao's voice cut through their thoughts. \"Don't get comfortable. Pick up the pace.\"\n\nHe glanced over his shoulder for the third time in as many minutes, tension radiating from his frame. The farmer called Piaro had killed Zibal in a single strike, yet Hao's guild couldn't understand why their master feared the other farmer who'd taken significantly longer to defeat Seuron.\n\nA lieutenant approached. \"The farmer who beat Seuron is strong, but he's not on Piaro's level. Why the paranoia?\"\n\nHao turned to face his subordinate. \"The farmer who killed Seuron is the sky above the sky.\"\n\n\"Sky above the sky?\" The lieutenant's eyes widened. \"You mean—\"\n\n\"Kraugel. Yes.\"\n\nOnly one person in Satisfy held that title. The straw hat had concealed his identity, but Hao possessed the skill to recognize even disguised legends.\n\nKraugel. The sole player Hao both admired and feared. Understanding dawned across the Hades Guild members' faces, followed immediately by agitation.\n\n\"This changes everything. If Kraugel serves Grid—\"\n\n\"He doesn't.\" Hao's tone brooked no argument. \"They're cooperating temporarily for unknown reasons.\" He paused, conviction hardening his features. \"Kraugel is the sky. He exists alone, beyond subordination.\"\n\nSilence answered him. The Hades Guild wanted to believe, but Grid had already absorbed the Tzedakah Guild into Overgeared. Could he truly claim Kraugel as well? The questions remained unspoken, mere speculation they wouldn't voice aloud to burden their master further.\n\nHao gestured forward. \"Move.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master.\"\n\nReidan's influence faded behind them. Soon they'd reach the desert's edge and enter imperial territory. Safety lay just ahead. The Hades Guild accelerated their march, cutting through desert monsters like a scythe through wheat. Nothing seemed capable of stopping them.\n\nBut life erected walls in series. Cross one, and another waited beyond. This truth applied to everyone.\n\n\"Stop.\"\n\nThe voice carried certainty, as if its owner had known they'd come to this exact spot. \"Leaving so soon? You haven't paid the toll yet.\"\n\nSilver hair gleamed in the moonlight. Lauel stood before them, one of the famed Ten Rookies, though calling him a rookie now seemed laughable. His growth rate after joining Overgeared had been monstrous, elevating him to a continental powerhouse.\n\n\"The price for treading Duke Grid's soil with your filthy boots?\" Lauel's eyes held no warmth. \"Pay it with your lives.\"\n\nFifteen Overgeared members materialized from the darkness behind him, faces grim and weapons ready. Hao studied their formation, his jaw tightening.\n\n*They have fewer numbers, but...*\n\nOvergeared fielded twenty-eight total members. Grid remained in the empire, Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl were still novices, and Jishuka defended Bairan with three others. Pon, Regas, and Euphemina pursued separate missions, while Vantner's group engaged the Golden Guild. Excluding Lauel, only fifteen stood before them.\n\nEighty against fifteen. The numerical advantage seemed overwhelming.\n\nBut Satisfy rewarded quality over quantity. Hao understood this fundamental truth all too well.\n\nThe fifteen Overgeared members were third advancement class users. All eighty Hades Guild members remained stuck at second advancement. The outcome wasn't in question. Hao opened his guild chat.\n\n*{All of you, run.}*\n\nThe response came immediately.\n\n*{Run? Master, what are you saying?}*\n\n*{I'll hold them. Escape through the gap I create.}*\n\nProtests flooded the channel.\n\n*{Master should flee while we buy time.}*\n\n*{We won't abandon you to the enemy.}*\n\nHao's rebuke silenced them. *{If all of you die here, our guild's power collapses. Retreat. That's an order.}*\n\nSacrifice seventy-nine or sacrifice one. The mathematics favored the latter. Every Hades member knew it.\n\nBut Hao ranked sixteenth on the unified rankings. The gap between eleventh and fiftieth was only four levels. A single death here would send his ranking into freefall.\n\n*{Rankings are symbols. Don't fixate on them.}* Hao's mental voice softened slightly. *{Run. We'll plan our revenge later.}*\n\nEventually, the Hades Guild would reach third advancement. Once the power gap narrowed, crushing Overgeared would become possible. Today's humiliation would be repaid.\n\n*{...Understood.}*\n\nThe guild members backed away, their master's determination overriding their loyalty.\n\nIbellin stepped forward. \"Where do you think you're going?\"\n\nThe Overgeared members moved to pursue, but Hao blocked their path. He drew an iron bar from his inventory and dragged it through the sand, carving a clear line.\n\nThe Overgeared members exchanged confused glances.\n\nHao planted the bar's end in the sand. \"For the next five minutes, you won't cross this line.\"\n\nSatisfy lacked a species selection function. Character creation forced all two billion users to start as human.\n\nDid that mean everyone remained human?\n\nNo. A minority found quests that changed them. Hao had completed one such quest.\n\n*Jjejeok! Jjejejeok!*\n\nHis shoulders split open. His back tore apart. Skin near his chest and abdomen peeled away, revealing crimson scales beneath.\n\n*Flap.*\n\nWings erupted from the wounds in his back, unfurling with wet snaps. His eyes shifted, whites and pupils bleeding to pure gold.\n\nHalf-draconian. The transformation increased his strength, agility, health, and resistance by ten percent. Incomplete flight and fire abilities manifested as well. The trade-off locked out most human skills, but Hao had never relied on skills anyway.\n\nHe possessed the ultimate physical form, wielding his body and secondary weapons as primary tools of destruction. The draconian transformation maximized everything he was.\n\nLauel's voice crackled across the Overgeared party channel. *{Toban, Laella, Zednos—handle Hao. Everyone else, run down the retreating members.}*\n\nHao ranked among Satisfy's strongest PvP specialists. Three members should suffice to contain him while the rest secured the kills. Lauel's logic was sound.\n\nHao barked a laugh. \"Only three? You're mocking me.\"\n\nThe three designated members formed a triangle around him.\n\n*Chwaruruk!*\n\nHao's chain lashed out before they'd finished positioning. It wrapped Toban's shield with frightening speed and precision. Toban stumbled forward, unprepared for the sudden yank. Hao's iron bar cracked against the back of his skull.\n\nThe dragon-eyed gaze snapped to Laella.\n\nThe bewildered mage triggered defensive magic stored in her orb, but her panic led to a critical error. She chose non-targeted spells.\n\nHitting Hao with non-targeted magic was virtually impossible. Even Yura, ranked fifth, had admitted she'd likely lose to him.\n\n*Peeok!*\n\n\"Kyak!\"\n\nThe bar struck Laella's sternum dead-center. She crumpled to the sand, gasping. Hao pressed forward, chaining combos to finish her.\n\n\"Shit! Someone stop him!\"\n\nIbellin charged, the blue flamberge Grid had forged for his third advancement cutting toward Hao's flank.\n\n\"Amateur.\"\n\nHao didn't even bother looking. A frontal assault from someone this inexperienced?\n\n*Chwaruruk!*\n\nSecondary weapons demanded exceptional control, discouraging most users from attempting mastery. Hao possessed Advanced Secondary Weapons Mastery. His chain whipped out, binding Ibellin's wrist mid-swing. Draconian strength yanked the young swordsman off his feet and hurled him across the sand.\n\nThe iron bar pivoted back to Laella's prone form, slamming into her exposed belly. Her body lifted off the ground. The weapon rotated and struck her slender throat with surgical precision.\n\n\"Uh...!\"\n\nBlood soaked the sand beneath her. As a mage, she couldn't endure Hao's physical assault. Only Toban's defensive buffs and Zednos' shields had kept her alive this long. Hao registered her stunned state and shifted targets to Zednos.\n\nThe wind mage had no time to cast. Hao's speed forced him to focus purely on defense. A shield materialized before him.\n\nToban had recovered, interposing himself to protect his teammate.\n\n*Peeeeeong!*\n\nThe iron bar collided with the massive shield. The impossible happened.\n\nToban, Overgeared's strongest tank and one of Satisfy's premier defensive specialists, slid backward two full steps.\n\n*This bastard!*\n\nHao had pinpointed the exact impact point to maximize force transfer through Toban's guard. It felt like facing Piaro. The man's combat sense truly was incredible, easily matching Pon and Regas.\n\nHao surveyed the Overgeared members, counting seconds in his head. \"Four minutes. I can hold for four more.\"\n\nOne minute had already elapsed since his five-minute declaration. The Hades Guild widened the gap with every passing second. After four minutes, pursuit would become impractical.\n\nLauel's irritation bled through his next command. \"Forget the runners! Everyone focus fire on him!\"\n\nThe Overgeared members converged, bringing all their power to bear on the draconian standing alone in the sand.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms**  \n**OG:** Glossary Link  \n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
