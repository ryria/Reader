Are you serious?'*\n\nThe Red Phoenix Bow gleamed on the altar before him—a legendary masterpiece born from his **Legendary Blacksmith's Creation** skill, the crystallization of everything Grid had learned. And now—\n\n*'I have to give it away?'*\n\nGrid stared in disbelief. Han Seokbong's expectant smile never wavered.\n\n\"The restored Red Phoenix Bow will allow me to safeguard Pangea for the rest of my life,\" the lord repeated, extending his hand. \"Please.\"\n\n\"Wait, this is... Ah!\" \n\nThe pieces clicked into place. *Restoration.* The word echoed in Grid's mind. To restore meant to *return* something to its rightful place. The Red Phoenix Bow was Pangea's national treasure—lost, yes, but never *abandoned*. Han Seokbong wasn't asking Grid to craft him a weapon.\n\nHe wanted Pangea's treasure *back*.\n\n*'Of course he does. It belongs here. How did I not...'*\n\nGrid's shoulders slumped. *'How could I be so stupid?'*\n\n\"Damn it,\" he muttered, tugging at his hair.\n\nThe frustration wasn't about the quest itself—that much he could admit. Building rapport with the lord, gaining access to the castle dungeons—those were rewards worth pursuing. If someone had told him upfront he'd have to surrender the finished bow, he would've accepted anyway.\n\nWhite phosphorus wood was plentiful on the East Continent. Materials weren't the issue. If the bow had been Epic-rated, or even Unique, Grid wouldn't have cared.\n\n*'But why—why did it have to turn out legendary?'*\n\nThe pattern was becoming unbearable. At the National Competition, he'd poured his soul into a growth-type longsword, only to watch it get whisked away by the system. Now, once again, a legendary creation slipped through his fingers before he could even appreciate it.\n\n*'Creating masterpieces just to hand them over to someone else...'*\n\nHe'd been so *proud* when that golden notification appeared. Like an idiot.\n\n\"My damn luck...\"\n\nThe words tasted bitter. There was no denying it—his cursed luck stat had struck again.\n\n\"Now then, shall we?\" \n\nHan Seokbong's gentle voice cut through Grid's brooding. The lord helped him to his feet with surprising strength, then gestured for both Grid and White to follow.\n\n---\n\nThe crowd outside erupted.\n\n*\"The lord is holding a blacksmith's hand!\"*\n\n*\"Lord Seokbong himself!\"*\n\n*\"Who is that man?!\"*\n\nCheers cascaded through the streets as the procession moved toward the castle. Grid barely registered the noise, still nursing his wounded pride.\n\nWhite, however, looked shell-shocked.\n\n\"He didn't even treat *me* like this last year,\" Enoch muttered from somewhere in the crowd, watching his former subordinate ascend to heights he'd never dreamed of. \"And I won the competition...\"\n\nThe Blue Flames smithy leader's face twisted with something between envy and disbelief.\n\n---\n\n**Pangea Castle**\n\n\"Hah...\"\n\nBy the time they reached the castle gates, Grid's complaints had died in his throat. \n\nPangea Castle stole his breath.\n\nThe architecture reminded him of Goryeo-era fortresses from historical dramas—sweeping tiled roofs, elegant wooden beams—but *grander*. More vibrant. The scale dwarfed anything he'd seen in the West Continent. They crossed polished marble floors, passed through seven successive gates, each more ornate than the last.\n\nFinally, they arrived at the innermost sanctum—the private quarters where only the lord's family and most trusted confidants could tread.\n\nWhite swallowed hard, his earlier excitement giving way to naked anxiety. \n\n\"That... Lord Seokbong.\" The blacksmith's voice trembled. \"I don't think this is a place for someone as lowly as me to—\"\n\n\"Lowly?\" Grid cut him off with a raised eyebrow. \"Why would you call yourself that?\"\n\n\"Haha! Exactly!\" Han Seokbong clapped Grid on the shoulder. \"Blacksmiths are the foundation of national strength! And White here is Pangea's finest! Only when you value yourself will the kingdom value you in return!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nWhite's eyes misted. Just this morning, he'd been a laughingstock—a failure who couldn't win a competition to save his life. Now, the lord of Pangea himself sang his praises. The roar of the crowd still echoed in his ears.\n\n*'My entire life changed in a single moment...'*\n\nHis gaze drifted to Grid, burning with gratitude and something uncomfortably close to worship.\n\n*'All thanks to him.'*\n\nGrid shifted uncomfortably. *'Why does every NPC look at me like that?'*\n\nIt had been like this since the beginning. Khan, Huroi's villagers, the old serf in Reidan—Grid seemed to attract middle-aged and elderly NPCs like a magnet. Meanwhile, he was a young man in his prime, and aside from Jishuka and a few others, beautiful female NPCs remained frustratingly out of reach.\n\n*'I've heard there are plenty of female blacksmiths in Satisfy.'*\n\nSo why did he only meet old men? Even the elf he'd encountered—Beniyaru—had been male.\n\n\"It can't be...\"\n\nWas his bad luck stat affecting *this* too?\n\nGrid's shoulders sagged. His mood plummeted further.\n\n---\n\nHan Seokbong led them to a side chamber within the inner palace. Calligraphy scrolls adorned the walls—elegant brushwork that spoke of decades of practice.\n\n\"Wow,\" Grid murmured despite himself. \"There are actually people in the world who can write as well as me.\"\n\nHan Seokbong coughed, a faint blush coloring his cheeks as he carefully removed a particular scroll from the wall. It wasn't a philosophical maxim—just the character for *'fire,'* written in bold strokes.\n\nBehind where the scroll had hung, a small button gleamed.\n\n*Click.*\n\nThe wall split down the middle with a grinding of stone, revealing a narrow staircase descending into darkness.\n\n\"This way.\"\n\nGrid and White exchanged glances. The entrance looked ominous—more dungeon than treasure vault.\n\nStill, Han Seokbong's benevolent smile never wavered. He gestured for them to follow and began descending.\n\n---\n\n\"A place like this exists beneath the castle...?\"\n\nThe underground chamber glowed with soft jade light. Monuments carved from luminous stone lined the walls, their surfaces covered in flowing script. Blue moss clung to the stonework, adding an ethereal ambiance.\n\nIt was small—intimate rather than grand—and suffused with a strange warmth.\n\n\"Too small for a dungeon,\" Grid muttered, glancing around. \"What is this place?\"\n\nHan Seokbong reverently placed the Red Phoenix Bow on a central altar before answering.\n\n\"This chamber sits at a convergence of auspicious energies—what we call good feng shui.\" He gestured to the surrounding monuments. \"The waterways beneath Pangea channel the power of the five elements. Metal, wood, water, fire, earth—all in perfect harmony. This space amplifies their resonance, ensuring prosperity and protection for generations to come. By housing the Red Phoenix Bow here, we—\"\n\n*'Waterways? Five elements? What is he even talking about?'*\n\nThe explanation stretched on. Grid's attention drifted. Arcane geomancy wasn't exactly his strong suit—most of Han Seokbong's words went in one ear and out the other.\n\n\"—and thus,\" the lord concluded with satisfaction, \"this sacred space will preserve Grid's magnificent work for all eternity.\"\n\n\"Ah... I see.\"\n\nOne thing was painfully clear: Grid would *never* get that legendary bow back.\n\n*'Sure, I could make another one. White phosphorus trees grow all over the East Continent.'*\n\nBut could he recreate a *legendary* rating? The odds felt astronomical.\n\n\"Wait!\" Grid straightened suddenly, a desperate thought occurring to him. \"Lord Seokbong, you should know—I only restored the bow's *function*, not the Red Phoenix's aura. Without that divine essence, isn't it just... a really nice bow? What's the point of keeping it here?\"\n\nIt was a last-ditch attempt to reclaim his creation. Han Seokbong, however, completely misread the situation.\n\n\"Distinguished one...\" The lord's eyes shimmered with emotion. \"You are truly extraordinary.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You've already restored Pangea's national treasure, yet you worry it isn't *enough*? Such humility...\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nGrid blinked. *Where is this going?*\n\n\"Your virtue rivals that of the greatest kings in the Cho Kingdom's history,\" Han Seokbong continued, clasping his hands together. \"I am moved beyond words. If you would permit me—I wish to bestow upon you a title befitting your character.\"\n\n*'A title!'*\n\nGrid's disappointment evaporated. Titles in **Satisfy** carried real power—stat bonuses, unique skills, passive effects. The more titles a player accumulated, the stronger they became. There was no reason to refuse.\n\n\"Yes! Give it to me!\" Grid nearly shouted, unable to contain his excitement.\n\nHan Seokbong nodded solemnly. \"You are a true gentleman of virtue. In honor of this achievement and our kingdom, I hereby name you **Pangea's Duke of Virtue**.\"\n\n\"Pangea's... Duke of Virtue.\"\n\nThe words settled over Grid like a wet blanket. Something felt *off*.\n\n> *'Just as some direct vampires hold the title of Wise Duke, humans too can earn ducal honors,'* Braham's voice echoed in Grid's mind, unbidden. *'Sword Saint Muller bore the title Duke of Pressure. Pagma himself was the Duke of Fire. These are symbols of legend—titles that grant immense power to those worthy of them. After Pagma received his, he could conjure flames with his hammer and swordsmanship alike.'*\n\n\"Oh...\"\n\nGrid's disappointment shifted to cautious hope. If this followed the same pattern—\n\n*'Then what ability do I get as a \"virtuous\" person?'*\n\nThe system notification materialized before he could finish the thought.\n\n---\n\n>[**The title 'Pangea's Duke of Virtue' has been acquired!**]\n\n>[**The passive skill 'Incomplete Virtue of Mercy' has been created!**]\n\n**[Incomplete Virtue of Mercy]**\n- **Category:** Passive  \n- When hunting monsters, there is a chance that you will show mercy and not take their lives.\n\n---\n\n\"Ah, fuck.\"\n\nThe curse slipped out before Grid could stop himself. Braham's voice returned, tinged with amusement.\n\n> *'Don't sulk like a child. Even a flawed duke title has value. Remember—these titles aren't singular achievements. You can acquire more as you grow. And even if you're stuck with this particular disaster forever, I'll simply have to compensate by making you powerful enough that it doesn't matter.'*\n\n\"I don't know anymore,\" Grid muttered, rubbing his temples. \"If this keeps up, I might just quit the game.\"\n\nAt that moment, Grid couldn't possibly imagine it—the true potential hidden within his virtuous title.\n\n---\n\n**S.A. Group Headquarters**\n\nChairman Lim Cheolho was reviewing quarterly reports when **Morpheus** interrupted with an alert.\n\n>[A duke title has been acquired.]\n\n\"What?\"\n\nLim Cheolho's coffee mug froze halfway to his lips. Duke titles were *incredibly* rare—symbolic honors reserved for players who either inherited a legend's legacy or were destined to become legends themselves. The requirements were staggering: countless achievements, widespread recognition from **Satisfy's** NPC population, and perfect timing.\n\n\"Morpheus, didn't your projections say these titles wouldn't emerge for another year and eight months?\"\n\n>[Correct. However, one of the five Miracle Players has once again defied my calculations. Grid continues to exceed all statistical models.]\n\n\"Grid...!\" Lim Cheolho laughed, leaning back in his chair. \"He broke your predictions *again*?\"\n\nGrid had become something of a favorite subject for the chairman. Watching a struggling young man rise through the ranks of the game he'd created brought Lim Cheolho genuine joy—like witnessing a success story unfold in real time.\n\n\"So what brilliant strategy did he use this time?\" Lim Cheolho asked, leaning forward with interest.\n\n>[No particular strategy. As usual, he earned the trust and gratitude of NPCs through respectful interactions and heroic interventions. When this pattern reached its 79th iteration, the title threshold was triggered.]\n\n\"Mm... That *does* sound like Grid.\"\n\nGrid possessed an almost supernatural talent for winning over NPCs—sometimes intentionally, often through hilarious misunderstandings. Neither Lim Cheolho nor **Morpheus** fully grasped how much of Grid's \"virtue\" stemmed from sheer accident.\n\n\"What title did he obtain?\"\n\n>[Pangea's Duke of Virtue.]\n\n\"*Pangea's*... Duke of Virtue?\"\n\nThe qualifier made sense—the \"Pangea's\" prefix indicated Grid hadn't yet achieved a *pure* virtue title. That was expected; it was far too early for a player to unlock a perfected legendary title.\n\nStill, Lim Cheolho couldn't suppress a grimace.\n\n\"Virtue? That doesn't exactly synergize with blacksmithing, does it?\"\n\nThe title had been designed with different legendary paths in mind—priests, paladins, perhaps certain knight classes. \n\n\"Why didn't he get Duke of Fire instead...?\" Lim Cheolho sighed, already imagining Grid's reaction. \"Oh boy. This is going to cause a meltdown.\"\n\nHe could practically *see* Grid losing his mind over this.\n\n\"Why does he have to be so kind to every NPC he meets?\" Lim Cheolho muttered, clicking his tongue.\n\nThis was the price of Grid's good heart—or at least, his uncanny ability to *appear* kindhearted. The chairman felt a mixture of sympathy and amusement.\n\n*'Well,'* he thought, taking a sip of coffee, *'it'll be entertaining to see how this plays out.'*"
