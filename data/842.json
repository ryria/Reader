  "content": "**Chapter [Number]**\n\nSatisfy offered freedom beyond the constraints of reality, its worldview vast enough to swallow years of exploration. A dedicated player could spend a lifetime discovering regional delicacies and hidden corners of the continent. Yet most chose a narrower path.\n\nThe typical ranker played Satisfy no differently than any other game—obsessed with climbing the rankings, spending every waking hour in hunting grounds. They abandoned the ordinary pleasures others enjoyed, grinding endlessly for experience. Their dedication earned them wealth, honor, and a place among the elite.\n\nGrid was not typical.\n\nHis status window told the story:\n\n**[Name: Grid]**\n**[Level: 362]**\n**[Class: Pagma's Descendant (Conditional Great Magician)]**\n**[Title: One who Became a Legend and 25 others]**\n**[Health: 88,815 | Mana: 14,268]**\n**[Strength: 3,160 (+360)]**\n**[Stamina: 1,987 (+580)]**\n**[Agility: 2,690 (+330)]**\n**[Intelligence: 1,838 (+540)]**\n**[Dexterity: 3,547 (+880)]**\n**[Persistence: 1,472 (+330)]**\n**[Composure: 1,078 (+330)]**\n**[Indomitable: 1,333 (+440)]**\n**[Dignity: 1,986 (+330)]**\n**[Insight: 1,826 (+330)]**\n**[Courage: 1,022 (+330)]**\n**[Political Power: 21 (+330)]**\n**[Demonic Power: 15,498]**\n**[Good Luck: 241]**\n**[Deity: 4]**\n**[Remaining Stat Points: 267]**\n\nCompared to normal rankers, Grid spent remarkably little time hunting. Most of his hours disappeared into the forge or responding to constant crises. By conventional logic, he shouldn't be anywhere near the single-digit rankings.\n\nYet there he was.\n\nThe secret lay not in grinding but in connections. Grid stood at the center of Satisfy's vast narrative web, linked to countless NPCs. Through those relationships, he'd challenged legendary bosses and uncovered hidden quests—gaining in a single raid what would take others a hundred days of hunting.\n\nOther players didn't understand this.\n\n\"100,000 Army Massacre Sword.\"\n\nThe air exploded. Dozens of energy blades materialized, filling the space above Penan's streets. Every soldier who'd rushed to answer Boutian's and Arisa's cries disintegrated into grey light. Over two hundred men, gone in an instant.\n\n\"You damn son of a—\" Boutian's voice cracked. He watched months of training and Merchant King Kir's gold evaporate before his eyes. In his obsession with Grid's position as king, he'd forgotten one crucial detail: Grid had never stopped being a ranker.\n\n*I should've known he'd chase us here. The bastard does nothing but eat and play that damned game.*\n\nThe thought was bitter with irony. Boutian himself averaged twelve hours a day in Satisfy, most of it spent in hunting grounds or executing Kir's orders. He'd never dreamed of cracking the single-digit rankings—his peak had been the top hundred. In his mind, Grid must spend every waking moment in the game.\n\n*If only I was ten years younger...*\n\nHis body had betrayed him in his forties, reflexes dulling with age. Envying Grid's youth, Boutian shouted, \"Full force! Build a barricade!\"\n\nDespite the massacre he'd just witnessed, Boutian didn't despair. Urban defense offered too many advantages. The barricades alone would force Grid to expose himself—while he destroyed them, archers and mages would have free shots. In a siege, numbers were absolute.\n\nCommon sense said so.\n\n\"Magic Missile.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nWhite projectiles lanced from the God Hands at one-per-second intervals. Throughout the city, barricades shattered like kindling.\n\n\"Lightning!\" A black cat dove at the soldiers, electrical energy crackling outward. Guards collapsed in convulsing heaps.\n\nBoutian's hands shook as he directed the archers. \"Hurry!\"\n\n\"Revolve.\"\n\nRandy—Grid's mirror image—stepped forward. Arrows struck an invisible barrier and rebounded, finding their own shooters.\n\n\"Kuock—!\"\n\n\"Ugh!\"\n\nArchers crumpled, pierced by their own shafts.\n\n\"What is this?\" Boutian and the remaining mages finally completed their spells, but momentum had already shifted against them.\n\n\"Did you think I'd come alone to fall for such obvious tactics?\" Grid's voice came from directly beside him—Freely Move closing the distance in an eyeblink.\n\n[You have suffered catastrophic damage!]\n\n[Your spirit can't endure it!]\n\n\"Cough!\" The Enlightenment Sword carved through Boutian's defenses, his health gauge plummeting below fifty percent. The stun effect locked his body in place. In that frozen moment, two grinning skeletons closed in.\n\n[You have dealt 509 damage to the target!]\n\n[You have suffered 480 damage!]\n\nA dagger slipped between Boutian's ribs. Soldiers rushed to protect their commander, but Boutian's rage overwhelmed his pain. \"You! Are you so arrogant you won't even finish me yourself?\"\n\nThe skeleton's dagger couldn't penetrate his defense—until it did.\n\n[Your ribs have been broken!]\n\n[Critical damage sustained! Skills cannot be used! Your spirit can't endure it. Movement speed reduced! Health recovery reduced by 80%!]\n\n[You have taken medicine for broken bones.]\n\n[The effect of the medicine isn't working.]\n\n[You need superior medicine for broken bones.]\n\n\"What?\" Ice flooded Boutian's veins. Grid had already moved on, cutting through the remaining soldiers with mechanical efficiency. The golden hands, the cat, the doppelganger, the skeletons—other players would treasure a single one of these assets. Grid wielded them all simultaneously.\n\n\"Ugh!\"\n\nBoutian watched Arisa struggle and fail against Grid's overwhelming individual power. The truth crystallized: Grid didn't just overwhelm high rankers in the two and three-digit ranks.\n\n*He's transcended what a player should be.*\n\nGrid wasn't an individual anymore. He was an army. A titan that couldn't fall. Only one option remained.\n\n\"Shit! Army... full force! Keok!\"\n\nAn Immortal necromancer's spell struck him down before the Overgeared Skeletons could deliver the finishing blow.\n\n\"Can't miss this opportunity.\" The necromancers smiled, raising the scattered corpses throughout the streets. Unlike the disaster at the empress' palace, today they had reinforcements—the Black and White Sisters.\n\n\"Been a long time, damn bastard.\"\n\n\"Today we settle accounts.\"\n\nThe sun-grade players who'd once dominated Blood Carnival stepped forward. After abandoning their former guild, they'd hidden within Immortal's ranks for months, training obsessively. They'd hunted, they'd leveled, they'd prepared. With Kir and Immortal backing them, they were certain of victory.\n\nWhite and Black burned through their energy, summoning clones. Revenge against Grid, against Faker, even against Grid's son Lord—all of it would be paid back today.\n\n\"Dieeeeeee!\"\n\nWhite obliterated the Overgeared Skeletons with a single blow. The sisters' clones surged toward Grid, who was still cutting through soldiers. They closed the distance.\n\nIt was suicide.\n\n\"Blackening.\" Grid didn't hesitate.\n\n\"Open the Rune of Darkness—Weakened Great Demon Astaroth's Power.\"\n\n\"...!!\"\n\n\"Storm Demonic Energy Field.\"\n\nThe overcast sky Grid had specifically waited for darkened further. Lightning erupted—four to eleven strikes per second, blanketing two hundred meters in every direction. Each bolt delivered ten thousand fixed damage. Paralysis. Stun. Burns. The sisters and every soldier within range suffered simultaneously.\n\n\"Eek! What kind of nonsense item is this?\"\n\nBlack somehow resisted the paralysis and stun through sheer willpower, teeth gritted against the pain. A field summon? This couldn't be a skill—it had to be a consumable item. Grid had stopped being a player and become a boss.\n\n\"Overgeared bastard!\" White forced her body forward through the crushing wind pressure, dodging lightning strikes. She poured everything into one blow—all her strength, all her anger, all her accumulated grudges.\n\nGrid's blackened form slipped past the attack as if it moved in slow motion. His counter-slash caught White mid-strike. He didn't stop until she dissolved into grey light.\n\n\"Sister!\" Black watched helplessly as lightning paralyzed her clones one by one.\n\nUnder this new sky, two suns couldn't coexist."
