  "content": "**[Pavranium]**\n\n*—The strongest mineral forged through collaboration between legendary blacksmith Pagma and legendary great magician Braham.*\n\n*Harder than adamantium, the god's mineral. More compatible with magic than mithril. More elastic than jaffa.*\n\n*By default, pavranium revolves around and protects its owner, responding to direct commands.*\n\n*• Through Goddess Rebecca's blessing, pavranium grants accelerated healing. Owner's health recovery speed increases by 300%.*\n\n*• Through God Dominion's blessing, pavranium enhances offensive power. Owner's attack power increases by 15%.*\n\n*• Through God Judar's blessing, pavranium bolsters defense. Owner's defensive power increases by 15%.*\n\n*Smelting Conditions: Pagma, Grid.*\n\n*Conditions of Use: Pagma, Grid.*\n\nPerfect? Not quite—the ego could be a disadvantage—but for him, pavranium was the ultimate material. Yet he'd never forged battle gear from it.\n\nWhy? Not because it was too difficult to smelt. As a class item for Pagma's Descendant, working with pavranium came naturally to him. Smelting and hammering the golden metal felt easier than working common iron ore, fluid as water under his hands.\n\nThe reason was simpler: it was too precious. Binding pavranium into rigid form felt wasteful when it could move and act independently.\n\nBut this was different. He was competing against a god. No room for sentiment when facing divinity itself.\n\n*CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!*\n\nHis hammer—the same one he'd wielded for years—struck true. Pavranium responded to his intent and technique, gradually taking the shape of a hammer.\n\nHexetia's eyes narrowed. *'Transcendent. Without question.'*\n\nThe speed was four to five times faster than ordinary human blacksmiths, the sophistication twenty times greater. Beyond human domain entirely. This skill matched Pagma himself, matched even the seven malignant saints who'd once earned Hexetia's jealousy.\n\nBut this one was different. Where Pagma had rebelled and resisted, this blacksmith understood, embraced, served. The divine stone—Hexetia's own creation, gathering the strength of all minerals—would prove the difference.\n\n*TANG!*\n\nHexetia placed divine stone on his anvil and began. Confidence surged through him. No mineral anywhere could match divine stone's perfection!\n\n*'Your feelings have reached me, Grid. Your abilities, too. Now I'll show you in return...'*\n\nThe greatness of a god!\n\n*'I'll brand my greatness into your soul. You'll serve me forever!'*\n\nUnloved. Alone. Hiding in shadows cast by the goddess of light. Why did he even exist? Acting on her will, yet remembered by no one. Forgotten. Avoided.\n\n*Why?*\n\nWhat was the point? Would it have been better never to exist at all?\n\nThese thoughts circled endlessly. Sometimes he envied the humans below—creatures who lived in the moment, who laughed and cried and found meaning despite their inferior nature. No such chance for meaning when existence meant solitude.\n\nUntil now. Finally, someone who understood his work. Someone who wanted to serve him.\n\n*'I'll prove my worth to Grid!'*\n\n*CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!*\n\nHexetia hammered desperately. No room to relax. He was far from the omnipotent god the world assumed.\n\n*'I can't miss this chance...!'*\n\nCouldn't lose. Wouldn't fail to prove his value. Wouldn't be alone again.\n\nHis hammering accelerated, surpassing the blacksmith's rhythm—ten times faster!\n\n*'What the—!'*\n\nSix strikes per second. A personal record. Yet the god hammered sixty times per second, metal blurring under his assault!\n\n*'Is that even... right, not human.'*\n\nDespite the flames burning from his nipples, Hexetia looked almost human. His personality, too—far from transcendent, almost ordinary. Easy to forget what he truly was.\n\nA god. The blacksmith god. A being who raised furnace temperatures by pinching his own nipples.\n\n*'Stay calm. Don't panic.'*\n\nWatching the impossible speed, he forced his hand to move again.\n\n*'Speed alone means nothing.'*\n\nQuality mattered. Sophistication was what metalworking demanded, not mere velocity. Rushing wouldn't produce refinement.\n\n*'Keep my own pace!'*\n\nNo time limit on this match. No reason to panic over Hexetia's speed advantage.\n\nThen—\n\n*CLANG!*\n\nHexetia paused. The divine stone had become a blade. He plunged the hot metal into cold water and withdrew it, entering the next stage.\n\n*CLAANG!*\n\nThe sound of tempering rang across the heavens.\n\n\"...!\"\n\nAdmiration mixed with wariness. The divine stone matched or exceeded pavranium's quality.\n\n*'Of course it does.'*\n\nPavranium: created by two legends. Divine stone: literally forged by a god. The divine stone was probably a higher-order material entirely.\n\n*'My best material... trivial before divinity...'*\n\nHis faith in pavranium wavered. Could he even compete in materials against a god?\n\n\"...\"\n\nStillness washed over him. His hammer stilled completely. Could he win when beaten in materials? Was the match already decided? Was he wasting time?\n\nDefeat loomed. The goddess' blessing slipping away. As these thoughts clouded his mind—\n\n*CLANG!*\n\nHexetia's tempering accelerated. Each hammer strike coincided with fresh flames from his nipples, reheating the blade and simplifying the process. Sweat rolled down Grid's face. As the work continued, more flames erupted, raising the ambient temperature. The air became volcanic, too hot even for a legendary blacksmith to endure. Now he understood why young angels avoided Hexetia's presence.\n\n\"Kgh...\"\n\nHe'd thought legendary blacksmiths were immune to temperature. Apparently there were limits. Confronted by how small he was before divinity, motivation died.\n\n*'I was insane. What made me think I could defeat a god?'*\n\nNatural to lose. Better to surrender cleanly. His only advantage—his tenacity—crumbled.\n\n*[The effect of Valhalla of Infinite Affection is maintaining your body temperature...]*\n\nThe notification strengthened his weakened body and mind. His suffering flesh felt light as air. Valhalla—Khan's masterpiece that he'd never removed—activated its temperature regulation.\n\n\"...Khan.\"\n\nHis heart clenched, reading Khan's intentions in the armor. Even in his final moments, Khan had prayed for his well-being. His grip tightened on the hammer.\n\n*'Khan never gave up.'*\n\nEven knowing his life was ending, Khan never released the hammer in his hand. He was a blacksmith. How could a legendary blacksmith drop his hammer? An unforgivable sin. Khan would be disappointed, watching from wherever he was now.\n\n*'Fight to the end. Even in defeat.'*\n\nHe couldn't disappoint Khan. And he wasn't fighting alone anymore. Khan's soul and will stood beside him.\n\n\"RAAAAGH!\"\n\nHe struck pavranium with renewed force. Remembering that Khan's final work—Valhalla of Infinite Affection—had been made without special materials. Black iron, relatively common now, was its foundation. Yet it had become an unprecedented item with myth-level performance.\n\nThe result didn't depend solely on material value. More important: the skill, intentions, and will of the maker. Khan's final lesson.\n\n*'Watch me until the end, Khan.'*\n\n*CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!*\n\nForged pavranium entered quenching, hot metal glowing gold.\n\n*'Your son faces a god with your teachings!'*\n\n*CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!*\n\n*[You are extremely focused. Legendary Blacksmith's Breath has activated.]*\n\n*[You are extremely focused. Legendary Blacksmith's Patience has activated.]*\n\n*[You are extremely focused. Legendary Blacksmith's Breath has activated.]*\n\n*[You are extremely focused. Legendary Blacksmith's Patience...]*\n\n*[......]*\n\n*[......]*\n\nIn Asgard's eternal daylight, beneath the serene sky, his first work reached completion.\n\n*[You have created a myth rated item!]*\n\nA new blacksmithing hammer was born."
