  "content": "# Chapter: Unexpected Encounter\n\nSurprisingly, many players chose the soldier class. The appeal was clear: stable income, consistent military quests, and skills that scaled with rank. Few classes offered such a comprehensive progression system. Yet for all these advantages, the drawbacks were equally significant.\n\nFreedom was the first casualty. Players had to log in at specific times for mandatory training. Orders from superiors weren't optional—they were absolute. The chain of command was rigid, and unrestricted travel was impossible.\n\nThis raised an obvious question: why would anyone *choose* to be a soldier in a game meant for escapism? What enjoyment could be found in a controlled, regimented existence?\n\nMost players viewed the soldier class negatively. But others saw opportunity where the masses saw restrictions.\n\nThe ambitious ones understood. A soldier could rise through the ranks based on merit alone. Power wasn't just possible—it was systematically guaranteed for those skilled enough to seize it. These players accepted short-term control for long-term accumulation.\n\nAmong them was a member of the Eternal Kingdom's naval R77 unit. His ID was simple: *Soldier*.\n\nThe name reflected his philosophy. In reality, he served in the US Army and thrived under its structure. He appreciated strict rules, valued the clarity of command hierarchies, and found satisfaction in violence sanctioned by authority.\n\n*Grid... Could there be a more perfect stepping stone for my promotion?*\n\nHe'd studied his target extensively. Grid was the hero who'd defended Reinhardt during the golem invasion. A skilled administrator who'd transformed the desolate Reidan into a thriving territory. A cunning strategist who'd absorbed both the Tzedakah and Silver Knights Guilds. A media manipulator who'd leveraged global attention to seize Patrian. The only legendary item maker in existence.\n\nReviewing Grid's history—including his performance at the National Competition—Soldier couldn't help but admire him. The man was exceptional. His legendary status was well-earned.\n\nWhich made him the perfect target.\n\n*The bigger the giant, the greater the glory in bringing him down.*\n\nGrid's rebellion against the Eternal Kingdom was opportunity incarnate.\n\n*One war. Multiple promotions. Possibly straight to commander in a single leap.*\n\n*But first, today's objective. I need to contribute meaningfully to Cork Island's occupation.*\n\n**Splash!**\n\n**Splash splash!**\n\nDeep into the night, thirty members of R77 dove from their ship. They descended into dark waters, slipping beneath the enemy's surveillance network. Third-generation magic wetsuits—developed by naval mages—kept them oxygenated and concealed.\n\nSoldier employed **Advanced Swimming Mastery Lv. 2**, a skill he'd painstakingly trained since joining the navy. His eyes gleamed with determination.\n\n*War hero. That's what I'll become.*\n\n***\n\nCork Island held special meaning for the Silver Knights Guild. Among Overgeared's territories, it possessed the highest economic value—dozens of mines and significant tourism revenue made it invaluable.\n\nAs the former guild master, Peak Sword was determined to defend it. He refused to surrender his old stronghold without a fight.\n\nYet realistically, withstanding the Eternal Kingdom's assault was impossible. Cork Island was isolated. The garrison numbered only a thousand soldiers averaging level 150. No named knights. No legendary defenders. Even if Grid himself were present, the island couldn't be held indefinitely.\n\nLauel had advised abandonment. Strategic retreat.\n\nPeak Sword's will, however, was unshakable.\n\n\"I'm a Korean who inherited the spirit of Admiral Yi Sunsin. I will never surrender.\"\n\nOne month. That was his goal. Tie up enemy forces for thirty days. Extract every gold piece of tax revenue from Cork Island while bleeding the Eternal Navy dry.\n\nFor five days, he'd fought with everything he had. The coastal fortifications built by Cork Island's previous lord proved their worth—several enemy ships already rested on the ocean floor.\n\nThe Silver Knights' ten elite members and Cork Island's soldiers deserved credit, but Peak Sword's naval tactical acumen was equally impressive. His lengthy territorial conflict with the Sakura Guild over this very island had forged him into a formidable maritime commander.\n\n\"Brother, you're pushing yourself too hard,\" Changsal said, eyeing the empty buff potion bottles accumulating near Peak Sword's position.\n\nHe was second-in-command of the Silver Knights Guild, and his concern was genuine.\n\n\"Making money is difficult. You won't be able to afford a wife at this rate. What's the point of drinking expensive potions if you end up a bachelor forever?\"\n\nLauel's warnings echoed in Peak Sword's mind. *Cork Island can't hold longer than a week. Accept that.*\n\nHe'd dismissed the prediction initially. But after five days of brutal combat, Lauel's assessment proved accurate. Even with Changsal and the Silver Knights elite, the navy's overwhelming numbers and superior resources were grinding them down. Stamina had limits. Human endurance had a breaking point.\n\n\"The men also need rest. The soldiers are already exhausted,\" Changsal pressed. \"Holding the island is admirable, but not if the cost is total annihilation...\"\n\n\"This isn't wasteful sacrifice,\" Peak Sword cut him off.\n\n\"This is for Overgeared.\"\n\nHe believed it worthwhile—absorbing pressure that would otherwise fall on Grid's shoulders and Lauel's strategies. He owed them everything. They'd given him purpose, resources, territory. Repayment required his absolute best effort.\n\nWhich was why tonight, he'd bring out his pickaxe.\n\nDeep into the night, Peak Sword judged the enemy fleet unlikely to attack in darkness. He stood.\n\n\"I'm heading to the mines.\"\n\n\"Good grief...\" Changsal clicked his tongue. \"Why mine every single night? You should rest when you have the chance.\"\n\n\"There are no efficient hunting grounds on this island. Level grinding is inefficient. But **Stamina** and **Persistence**?\" Peak Sword smiled. \"Those I can improve. God Grid would do the same. You know God Grid?\"\n\nRepetitive labor generated small but steady stat growth. Mining, particularly, brought Peak Sword a strange satisfaction—the tactile pleasure when his pickaxe struck true and revealed hidden minerals.\n\n\"Everyone else, get some sleep. I'm going.\"\n\nHe left his colleagues behind and headed for the mine closest to the coast. Its yield was lower than Cork Island's other excavation sites, but proximity to the fortress was essential. The other mines were too distant—if the enemy launched a surprise attack, he needed to respond immediately.\n\n*At least this mine's position allows me to reinforce the walls within minutes if needed.*\n\n**Ttang! Ttang!**\n\nThe dark mine swallowed him. Peak Sword lit several torches, their flickering light casting dancing shadows on rough stone walls. He raised his pickaxe and began working.\n\nThe wall was solid. Each strike resonated through his arms. He wasn't rushed—minerals weren't the goal. **Stamina** growth was the objective, and labor was the most efficient path.\n\n**[Your Persistence has increased by 1.]**\n\n**[Your Stamina has increased by 1.]**\n\n**[The Intermediate Mining skill has increased to Lv. 3.]**\n\n\"Yes...! Excellent!\"\n\nHow satisfying was this?\n\n**Kaaang! Kaaang!**\n\nA genuine smile crossed Peak Sword's face as he continued his rhythm.\n\n**Teong!**\n\n**Teeeeeong!**\n\n\"...?\"\n\nFrom the mine's deepest reaches—the end of a narrow tunnel—a faint sound emerged. Peak Sword tilted his head.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nIt was fundamentally different from wind. The sound had weight. Substance. And it came from *behind* the wall.\n\n\"...Could it be?\"\n\nPeak Sword's eyes brightened.\n\n\"A secret dungeon?\"\n\nIf true, this was a jackpot. Discovering a new dungeon meant substantial rewards. More importantly, he could potentially redirect the dungeon's monsters against the invading navy.\n\n*This dungeon is positioned right next to the battlefield. If I time it properly, I could weaponize the mob spawns against the enemy.*\n\nThe idea was likely too optimistic, but hope was intoxicating.\n\n*Gulp.*\n\nAnticipation and tension filled Peak Sword in equal measure. He gripped his pickaxe and faced the completely sealed wall.\n\n*Hidden locations always contain great treasures.*\n\nHe had to see what lay beyond! Peak Sword tightened his grip, then assumed a familiar stance—the drawing posture. This technique granted class bonuses when wielding weapons or tools and allowed him to channel his swordsmanship principles into any implement, just as Piaro combined farming with blade techniques.\n\n\"Draw Sword.\"\n\n**Surung!**\n\nThe pickaxe Grid had forged for him was no ordinary mining tool. Its **Durability** and attack power far exceeded standard equipment, transforming it into a legitimate weapon.\n\n\"Fang.\"\n\n**Paaaat!**\n\nLight erupted from Peak Sword's fingertips like a released arrow.\n\n**Kurururung!**\n\nThe wall—his intended target—suddenly collapsed on its own.\n\nAnd...\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\nFrom behind the crumbled stone, a figure appeared. The ID above his head read: *Soldier*.\n\nA player. Like Peak Sword.\n\n\"?????\"\n\n\"?????\"\n\nFor one frozen heartbeat, Peak Sword and Soldier locked eyes. The same question crystallized in both minds:\n\n*Who the hell—?*\n\nThe moment of confusion shattered.\n\nBoth men understood the situation simultaneously, but Peak Sword's pickaxe moved first.\n\n**Puok!**\n\n\"Kuk... Keeoook!\"\n\n*What the hell is this?* Soldier's mind reeled. *A miner? Covered in coal dust? Why is someone mining during wartime, and why—HOW—is he mining directly in front of our secret tunnel entrance?!*\n\n\"D-Dammit...\"\n\nWas this how he died? A rising star of the Eternal Kingdom's military, killed by a *miner* in a random cave?\n\n**Stagger.**\n\nConfusion overwhelmed Soldier as he stumbled backward. Blood streamed from where the pickaxe had connected with his forehead. His body began turning grey, the slow dissolution of a player suffering lethal damage.\n\nDraw Sword. The technique required significant activation time and had a lengthy recovery period. But its attack power ranked among the highest burst damage skills available.\n\nThis wasn't an ordinary pickaxe either. The power channeled through Grid's craftsmanship was devastating—sufficient to instantly eliminate a level 250 player ranked within the top 10,000. Peak Sword's overwhelming presence triggered Soldier's fear resistance, but it couldn't save him.\n\n\"You... What *are* you?\"\n\nThe remaining R77 members stared in shock as their comrade was murdered before their eyes. Peak Sword belatedly grasped the situation's full implications.\n\n\"Swo... No, a miner. Just an ordinary miner from Cork Island.\"\n\n\"*What?*\"\n\nThe coincidence seemed absurd, but their ace operative had died in a single strike. The R77 members understood this \"miner\" was anything but ordinary. Yet they couldn't deny the evidence—the coal dust, the pickaxe, the mining tunnel...\n\n**Clink!**\n\nPeak Sword recovered his bloodied pickaxe and shifted into combat stance. This time, however, he drew a proper sword instead of relying on mining equipment. The R77 members' eyes widened as they watched his hand move to the sheath.\n\n\"This is no joke!\"\n\nToo late. The R77 troops had given Peak Sword all the time he needed.\n\n\"Annihilate.\"\n\n**Ku kwa kwa kwa kwa! Ku kwa kwa kwa kwa!**\n\nThe R77 unit—elite naval commandos who'd accumulated extensive combat experience across multiple campaigns—were annihilated. Their complete destruction in a random mine shaft would become the kind of rare catastrophic failure that sent the navy's high command into frantic crisis mode."
