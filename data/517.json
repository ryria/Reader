  "content": "Grid raised his hand. \"Magic Detection.\"\n\nThe spell activated with a familiar pulse of mana. Magic Detection (Enhanced) Level 2 required five seconds to cast with an eight-minute cooldown. A significant improvement over the base version.\n\nAfter passing through the north gate, Grid maintained a steady rhythm. Every time the cooldown elapsed, he cast the spell again. Braham's Boots reduced his cooldown times, allowing him to use Magic Detection every five and a half minutes during his journey toward the monster community.\n\n*Two birds, one stone.* He needed to level the skill, and the East Continent was unpredictable. Better to be prepared.\n\n\"Magic Detection.\"\n\nThe environment here was ideal for training. Normally, the spell consumed 2,000 mana per cast. Prohibitive for frequent use. But the East Continent's ambient mana saturation accelerated his regeneration rate. Combined with the Ring of Absurdity's fifty percent cost reduction, he could spam the spell indefinitely during hunts.\n\nGrid glanced at the ring on his finger. \"This thing is ridiculous.\"\n\nThe Ring of Absurdity, looted from Black. A single accessory worth more than entire armor sets. Most accessories sacrificed raw stats for special effects. This one defied convention. It sat at the apex of its category.\n\n*If only I could craft accessories.*\n\nTechnically, he could. Simple bands and chains were within his capabilities. But accessories existed for two reasons: aesthetics and unique enchantments that equipment couldn't provide. His attempts produced crude, ugly things. No options. No appeal. A waste of materials and time, like Idan's cooking.\n\nGrid's stomach churned at the memory. \"Ugh. Still makes me sick. How is that restaurant still open?\"\n\nHe shook his head. *There must be something. Some hook beyond the food itself.*\n\nThe northern road deteriorated with each step. Weeds choked the path. Cracks spiderwebbed across ancient stones. No maintenance crews this far out. Grid's expression hardened. Unknown territory. No guidebooks. No veteran advice.\n\n*I'm ahead of them.*\n\nThe thought struck him with sudden clarity. He spent so much time measuring himself against Kraugel, feeling like he was chasing the man's shadow. Following a trail already blazed. But objectively? They were peers now. Equals.\n\n*Soon, I'll overtake him.*\n\nCurrent Grid vastly outstripped the Kraugel who'd first reached the East Continent. Stronger. More versatile. More options. Pride swelled in his chest.\n\n*The rankers I used to watch from afar...*\n\nNow he stood at the summit with them. Most sat below him on the rankings. The envy and longing he'd once felt had transformed into something else entirely.\n\n*This game is incredible!*\n\nThe fundamental human need to accomplish something meaningful. Satisfy had become the dominant global culture. Being the best here meant being the best in the world. Period. Grid's hands trembled with excitement. He wanted to scream into the sky.\n\nThe East Continent stretched before him. Empty of players. Just NPCs and wilderness. Liberation washed over him like cool water. A rich, deserted island ripe for plunder. No guild politics. No diplomatic considerations. No maintaining the Overgeared Master persona.\n\nGrid broke into a run toward the distant pine forest. His laughter echoed across the wasteland. Wild. Unrestrained. Like a madman in the city square.\n\n*Interesting.*\n\nBraham observed Grid's undignified sprint with mild amusement. The man was running around like a dog in heat, yet somehow still maintained combat awareness.\n\n*Cautious even while excited?*\n\nNo openings. Despite the seemingly carefree behavior.\n\n*He's still growing, still flawed, but he has the minimum requirements for a legend.*\n\nSomeone might see Grid's antics as a vulnerability. A moment to strike.\n\n*They'd die.*\n\nBraham filed the thought away.\n\nGrid entered the pine forest. Needles crunched under his boots.\n\n*Kyaooooh!*\n\nA massive shape erupted from the undergrowth. Fangs and claws. Grid's sword was already moving. Not a monster. A tiger. A mundane beast that had fled the monster community.\n\n\"Die and leave your hide!\"\n\nMagic Detection (Enhanced) had spotted it seconds ago. Grid cut the tiger down mid-lunge. Its pelt materialized in his inventory.\n\nHe frowned, scanning the forest. \"Too quiet. Where are the monsters?\"\n\n*Don't use demonic power here. This place won't tolerate it.*\n\n\"Ah. Because of this?\"\n\nA notification hung in his vision.\n\n> [You have entered: Tranquil Pine Forest]\n> A refreshing energy permeates this place. Health and mana regeneration increased by 20%.\n\n\"A safe zone near the hunting grounds.\" Grid nodded to himself. \"I can retreat here if things go bad.\"\n\n*You're capable of thinking like a dog or cat now. Progress. Keep developing steadily.*\n\nThe crude words didn't bother Grid. He could sense Braham's emotions through their soul link. No malice. Just affection. Still, Grid's personality demanded reciprocation.\n\n\"Tsk tsk. That mouth of yours.\" Grid smirked. \"No wonder your only friend betrayed you.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nBraham recoiled as if struck. Betrayed and murdered by his closest friend, now mocked by his current friend. The legendary great magician tried to maintain composure.\n\n*H-He wasn't... friend... he...*\n\nThe quiver in Braham's voice made Grid wince. He coughed. \"Uh. Right. Anyway.\"\n\nGrid exited the forest quickly. The pine grove wasn't large. Beyond the treeline, the monster community sprawled before him.\n\nArched tents dotted the landscape. Hundreds of them. Grid counted silently. Five hundred, minimum. Two monsters per tent meant a thousand residents at least.\n\n\"They have tents. Tools. Organization.\" Grid studied the layout. \"High intelligence? Lizardmen variant?\"\n\nHe waited for Braham's input. Nothing. The great magician was still wallowing in shock. His spirit was ironically fragile toward those he cared about, despite his cruel tendencies.\n\nGrid clicked his tongue. \"How long will you sulk? You're not a child. You're hundreds of years old.\"\n\nHypocrisy, considering Grid's own lack of friends outside Overgeared. His personality and obliviousness made friendship difficult. He and Braham were similar in that regard.\n\n*Whatever. Focus on the community.*\n\nThe five hundred tents spread across the area, separated by fifty-meter intervals. Low fences divided the sections. Privacy mattered to these creatures.\n\n*Humanoid, not lizardmen. Social but independent.*\n\nHigh living standards. Strong sense of personal space. What species fit that profile? Grid drew a blank.\n\n*Right. This is the East Continent.*\n\nWestern assumptions meant nothing here. Common sense from back home wouldn't apply.\n\n*I need to see for myself.*\n\nGrid activated his Hooded Zip Up. His form vanished. He crept toward the nearest tent.\n\n*No presence?*\n\nThe silence was absolute. Wrong. This was supposed to be a thriving community. Every tent seemed empty.\n\n*Did they evacuate?*\n\nBut a thousand monsters moving in unison would leave traces. Trampled grass. Disturbed soil. He saw nothing.\n\n*Nap time?*\n\nThe absurd thought crossed his mind before he dismissed it. Grid peered inside the tent.\n\nHe froze.\n\nA rat. No. More like a hamster. A large hamster couple sleeping peacefully inside their tent.\n\n*Cute monsters?*\n\nWrong focus. They had the 'hide' passive. Their information panels were blank even at close range.\n\n*This is cheating.*\n\n\"Muong?\"\n\nThe hamsters' noses twitched. They stirred. Rose. Both heads swiveled toward Grid's exact position despite his invisibility.\n\n\"Kyaak!\"\n\nTheir mouths gaped wide. Cuteness evaporated. Hundreds of needle-sharp teeth lined their jaws in rows. Serrated. Stained. Rotting food wedged between them.\n\nGrid staggered back. \"Kuk!\"\n\nThe wrongness of it hit him like a physical blow.\n\n\"Braham, are you seeing this? There's putrefied meat stuck in their...\" The smell reached him. Grid covered his nose. \"Ugh!\"\n\nToo late.\n\nThe hamsters, actually called 'big poisonous rats,' weaponized their breath. The stench triggered confusion and poison status effects. Grid's legendary resistance blocked the debuffs, but the discomfort remained overwhelming.\n\n\"Human! Muong! Kill! Muong!\"\n\nThe big poisonous rats lunged. Tridents appeared in their paws. Their black eyes shifted to crimson. Venom dripped from their protruding front teeth.\n\n*Fast!*\n\nTheir attack speed matched true blood vampires. Tails whipped at Grid's weak points with disturbing accuracy.\n\n*Peeng!*\n\nGrid swapped his Hooded Zip Up for Lantier's Cloak mid-dodge. The ground where he'd stood exploded under a trident strike. These creatures inflicted confusion and poison through proximity, then finished victims with overwhelming speed and power. Comparable to top-tier Western monsters.\n\nGrid grinned. Excitement replaced apprehension. He'd expected the East Continent to be brutal. Harder monsters meant better experience.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship, Kill!\"\n\nThe tent's interior was cramped for combat. Grid used his sword dance footwork to evade, then chained his attack.\n\n*Chaaeng!*\n\nKill struck both hamsters simultaneously. They died instantly. A notification blazed across Grid's vision.\n\n> [You have defeated a Big Poisonous Rat]\n> 35,970,411 experience acquired.\n\nGrid exhaled slowly. \"Kek.\" The number stunned him. Far beyond his projections."
