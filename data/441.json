The user will be selected by the sword.\n\n*Unbelievable!*\n\nThree and a half years as a blacksmith. According to Satisfy's accelerated time, Panmir had produced at least 20,000 items over a decade of grinding labor. More than 500 had consumed over six hours each. Yet despite this mountain of work, he could count on two hands the pieces worthy of being called \"masterpieces.\" The ratio was abysmal. Top-rated items with efficient options remained frustratingly rare.\n\nBut today? In front of the world? A masterpiece.\n\nPerfect timing. The spotlight couldn't have been better. In all his fifty years, Panmir had never felt this alive.\n\n\"Good!\" The word burst from him, unbidden. Age fell away. His hands trembled with vindication.\n\n*I've proven it. Grid is just luck. A legend by chance. My years weren't wasted.*\n\nThe thought crystallized into certainty. *I won.*\n\nEven if Grid somehow produced a legendary-rated blade, it wouldn't matter. Panmir had combined blacksmith mastery with dwarven technique to create the finest level 300 longsword possible. The peak of craftsmanship. Powerful and noble.\n\nThe MC's voice cut through his euphoria.\n\n\"L-Legendary blacksmith Grid was the only one who made a normal rated sword...?\"\n\nPanmir's breath caught.\n\nThe host continued his confirmation, moving from participant to participant. Each word drove ice deeper into Panmir's chest. Around him, the other blacksmiths stood frozen, disbelief etched across their faces.\n\nGrid. A legendary blacksmith. Normal rating.\n\nThe concepts refused to align.\n\n*Even advanced blacksmiths produce rare items as a baseline.*\n\n*A legendary class should spit out rares just by hitting the production button.*\n\nWhat insanity could drive the result so low? Catastrophic bad luck? There had to be an explanation.\n\n*Forgotten ingredients?*\n\n*The smelting looked flawless... Did he bungle the forging completely?*\n\nSteng, who had also crafted a unique-rated sword, broke the stunned silence. \"It isn't possible for Grid to make a normal rated item!\" His protest carried the weight of firsthand observation.\n\n\"Grid struck the steel three times in the time I took to strike it once.\" Steng's gestures became emphatic. \"When I was gasping for air, Grid's posture hadn't changed!\"\n\nNo hyperbole colored the claim. Steng's eyes held conviction. Unless Grid had destroyed a galaxy in a past life and earned karmic retribution, a normal-rated item shouldn't exist.\n\n\"Check the item information again! This is obviously a mistake...\" Steng's defense died mid-sentence.\n\n\"Shit.\" Grid's curse was quiet, venomous. His face twisted with fury.\n\n*So it's real.*\n\nSteng's certainty crumbled. Grid had actually produced a normal-rated item. Despite the skill. Despite the effort. All negated.\n\n*Is this operator manipulation?*\n\nThe thought surfaced unbidden. Steng stared at Grid, processing the impossible.\n\n*Unlucky doesn't begin to cover it.*\n\nHours working beside Grid had given Steng insight into the man's character. Grid caught his gaze.\n\n\"The ownership of the item created...\" Grid's voice shook. Rage barely contained. \"We don't keep it, do we?\"\n\nSteng managed a nod. \"That's correct.\" His throat felt tight. \"It will be permanently displayed in the National Competition's Hall of Fame.\"\n\nThe implication hung between them. Grid's failure immortalized. A normal-rated blade bearing the legendary blacksmith's name, exhibited to the world. The humiliation would be eternal.\n\n*I'd want to crawl into a hole and never emerge.*\n\nSympathy welled up. Steng dreaded Grid might quit Satisfy entirely from the shame. Grid exhaled deeply, muttering to himself.\n\n\"Hah, I have to return this. It's ridiculous.\"\n\nSteng blinked. *Return what?*\n\nSomething felt off. Grid's anger seemed... misdirected? Before Steng could process it, the host's voice boomed across the venue.\n\n\"How many of you would expect a legendary blacksmith to produce a normal item? Yes, that's right! I couldn't even expect it!\"\n\nThe participants converged on Grid's sword. Panmir and Steng pushed forward, eyes widening as they examined the blade.\n\n*At first glance, nothing special. A plain longsword.*\n\n*But the craftsmanship... This is massive!*\n\nNormal rating? Steng's professional eye caught details that defied the classification. Panmir leaned closer, reassessing. The other blacksmiths began murmuring as realization dawned. Their expertise allowed them to see what the ordinary public could not.\n\nThe broadcast chat exploded:\n\n—What type of legendary blacksmith makes normal items? It might be different if he made it in 10 minutes, but hasn't he been hammering for 8 hours?\n\n—Was he just hammering the air?\n\n—Was he sleeping...? ㅋㅋㅋ\n\n—I'm only a beginner blacksmith, but my analysis is that Grid seems to have very low dexterity. He doesn't have experience with manual work because he can easily make items with his class, thus not raising his dexterity.\n\n—Is that why the result is so bad? No, there's no way. No matter how low his dexterity is, won't there be a compensation effect due to his legendary class? Then how did he make a normal rated item?\n\n—It seems to be the result of his insufficient skills combined with worst luck.\n\n—Insufficient skills ㅋㅋㅋ His combat skills have increased since last year, so he must've neglected his blacksmithing.\n\n—Stop talking nonsense. What evidence is there that Grid's skills are lacking?\n\n—That's right. Look at the items that Grid was wearing. He made them himself, so it doesn't make sense to say his skills are bad. This time, he was just unlucky.\n\n—Is there any proof those items were made by Grid? Maybe he obtained them from raids?\n\nThe dissection of Grid's abilities became surgical. Public criticism sharpened to ridicule. Grid's night with Yura and Jishuka remained fresh in collective memory. Anti-fans emerged from their caves, emboldened.\n\nSouth Korea descended into chaos.\n\n*(Breaking News) Shocking! The legendary blacksmith Grid made a normal rated item!*\n\n*(Breaking News) South Korea missed the gold medal... It's virtually impossible to get 1st place now! Grid, he enjoyed a promiscuous private life and forgot his duties.*\n\nThe media turned feral. South Korea, weak in Satisfy's competitive scene, had pinned its dreams on Grid. That fact evaporated beneath sensational headlines.\n\nIn the Shin household, pain settled like lead.\n\n\"This is disgusting...! They are scum!\" Youngwoo's father slammed his palm on the armrest.\n\n\"Oh my, Honey.\" His mother placed a restraining hand on his arm. \"No matter how angry you are, don't use such words in front of Sehee!\"\n\n\"Hum hum.\" The man cleared his throat, chastened.\n\nOn the television, their son stood beneath the world's scrutiny. He'd traveled to a foreign land for national honor. One mistake, and the country devoured him.\n\n\"How resentful would he be!?\" Youngwoo's mother wrung her hands.\n\n\"He paid off all his debt and cleared his father's debt as well,\" his father said quietly.\n\n\"N-No, Honey... How many times have I told you that I will pay Youngwoo back? If you say that at this timing...\"\n\nSehee, who had been watching silently, smiled.\n\n\"He's fine.\"\n\nA lifetime of responsibility for her incompetent brother had taught Sehee to read him. She never spoke of it, but she knew her brother's tells better than anyone.\n\n*He's frowning, but his left eyebrow is raised.*\n\nHappiness and sadness, mixed in equal measure. The worst hadn't happened. Her insight rarely failed.\n\nThe host's voice swelled with theatrical energy. \"A legendary blacksmith made a normal rated item? I think there are countless people disappointed with the outcome! But let that disappointment go! This is why a legend is a legend! Grid proved to be in a different class from the other participants!!\"\n\nMeaningful words. Pregnant with hidden meaning. The sword's options materialized on screens worldwide.\n\n> **Sealed Transcendent Sword**\n> \n> Rating: Normal (Growth)  \n> Durability: 360/360 Attack Power: 401\n> \n> * One option is added every time the rating increases.\n> \n> The legendary blacksmith Grid made a longsword with skills and a commitment beyond human limitations.\n> \n> A blade of steel that was hammered more than 45,000 times in a short period of time, it is beyond ideal and has a transcendent power.\n> \n> However, it is limited by the typical form, causing its power to be sealed.\n> \n> It will gradually find the right form and release its true strength in the process of being cut, hit and reworked.\n> \n> User Restriction: Level 300 or higher. Intermediate Sword Mastery level 7. 1,500 strength.\n\n\"Heok!\" Panmir's exclamation came strangled.\n\n\"A growth type item?!\" Steng's voice cracked.\n\nUnderstanding crashed over them. The blacksmiths stared at Grid's creation, seeing their own hubris reflected in the steel. The \"ideal form\" they'd chased their entire careers was a cage. Their mission should have been to transcend it. This wasn't luck. This wasn't class privilege.\n\n*Grid, I misunderstood you.*\n\nPanmir's hands fell to his sides. Grid had worked. Trained. Suffered the same brutal path Panmir himself had walked. Perhaps harder.\n\n*Respect.*\n\nPride and bias had blinded him. Panmir bowed his head, shame heating his neck. Around him, the other blacksmiths followed suit. Acknowledgment of defeat. Recognition of superiority.\n\nGrid reigned over the world's finest blacksmiths. The National Competition's ratings shattered records yet again.\n\nGrid noticed none of it.\n\n*Ah, shit. I got nervous when Legendary Blacksmith's Breath appeared.*\n\nHis disappointment sat heavy in his chest."
