  "content": "Grid's hands moved with practiced precision over the workbench. The Red Phoenix Bow had taught him a valuable lesson—myth-rated items required divine materials. The Red Phoenix's Breath had been the key then.\n\n*Lifael's Spear must contain something from Goddess Rebecca. My skills have improved since I last examined it. I should be able to find it now.*\n\nHe reached for the spear, his fingers tracing its contours. *Once I understand the material, I can remodel it.*\n\nWith steady movements, Grid removed the decorative fleece from the spearhead. His hands never faltered as he separated each component, working with surgical precision. No connecting parts suffered damage. No joints were stressed.\n\nThe Reinhardt blacksmiths gathered closer, their eyes wide.\n\n\"Look at that touch,\" one whispered. \"Like caressing a lover's skin—delicate beyond measure.\"\n\n\"Yet fast. No hesitation.\"\n\nA master smith nodded slowly. \"Pagma's Descendant lives up to the title. He's reached heights that only a dwarf lord could match.\"\n\nTheir imaginations ignited with possibility. A new kingdom led by such a master—it would be a paradise for their craft. Perhaps he would teach them directly. Perhaps competitions would be held. Reinhardt could become a mecca for smiths across the continent.\n\nGrid registered none of their excitement. The world narrowed to the spear in his hands and the mystery it held.\n\nDamian and Isabel watched in silence. The sacred artifact of the Rebecca Church lay in pieces, its components glowing molten in the forge. Neither showed concern. They had faith.\n\nThat faith wavered as Grid's expression darkened.\n\n*I don't understand.*\n\nEvery component lay separated, the metals cooled and catalogued. Not a scrap had been lost to his work. Yet something was wrong.\n\n*Where is it? Where's the goddess's touch?*\n\nThe spear consisted of pure adamantium. The secondary parts—more adamantium. He activated his skill on each piece, searching.\n\n**Legendary Blacksmith's Appraisal.**\n\nThe results came back identical every time.\n\n*Just adamantium. Plain, unblessed adamantium.*\n\nHis jaw clenched. *How? How can a myth-rated weapon exist without divine materials?*\n\nA thought crystallized, cold and unwelcome.\n\n*Unless... a god forged it.*\n\nThe hypothesis fit. If a divine blacksmith had crafted the weapon, the maker's nature—not the materials—would grant the rating. A god's technique, not a god's essence.\n\n*Which means I can't remodel it.*\n\nThe realization hit like a hammer blow. Without special materials to manipulate, he couldn't recreate myth-rated work. Just as the Red Phoenix Bow had been impossible without the Red Phoenix's Breath, this would be—\n\n*Damn it.*\n\nIsabel's freedom slipped through his fingers like sand. He refused to accept it, yet the evidence stared him in the face.\n\n\"Do you know who made this spear?\" Grid's voice came rough.\n\nDamian shook his head. \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I have no idea,\" Isabel added.\n\n\"Anything about its origin?\"\n\n\"There's a legend,\" Damian said slowly. \"Long ago, the first pope received divine artifacts directly from Goddess Rebecca.\"\n\n\"Directly from the goddess...\"\n\nGrid's mind raced. Legends of Pagma and Braham had proven true. Why not this?\n\n*A weapon from Rebecca's own hands. Forged in the divine realm. Created with a god's craft, not a god's materials.*\n\nHis hands fell to his sides. The weight of failure pressed down on his shoulders. Isabel and Damian had trusted him, and he'd raised their hopes for nothing. His own limitations mocked him.\n\nHe could force the reconstruction. Push through despite his lack of understanding. But the risk—he might destroy Lifael's Spear entirely, rendering it useless.\n\nThe choice made itself.\n\nGrid carefully reassembled the components. Each piece slotted into place, the spear reforming under his practiced touch. He reached for the decorative fleece, preparing to hang it back near the spearhead.\n\nThe white bundle felt soft in his palm, delicate as a dandelion.\n\n*Wait.*\n\nHis hand froze mid-motion.\n\n*This fluffy thing... is it actually part of the spear?*\n\nThe ornament had been present from his first examination. He'd assumed Isabel had added it—a personal touch to her weapon.\n\n*But would she?*\n\nThe thought unraveled his assumption. Isabel revered Goddess Rebecca above all else. The spear was a gift from her goddess, a sacred trust. Would she dare attach something frivolous to it? Would she treat a divine artifact like common jewelry?\n\n\"Isabel.\" Grid held up the bundle. \"You didn't add this, did you? It came with the spear?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's right.\"\n\nLight broke through the darkness clouding his mind. Grid's lips curved into a grin.\n\n\"**Legendary Blacksmith's Appraisal.**\"\n\nHe focused the skill on the fluff itself.\n\n> **[The blacksmith who became a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]**\n\n> **[Fluffy Bundle]**\n> *An ornament hanging on Lifael's Spear.*\n> *A pretty white fluff.*\n> *Weight: 0*\n\n> **[!!!!!!!!!]**\n\n> **[You have discovered a hidden feature in the item!]**\n\n> **[The information about the target item has been updated.]**\n\n> **[<span class=\"myth\">Goddess' Fluffy Hair</span>]**\n> *Fine hair belonging to Rebecca, goddess of light.*\n> *It has long fallen away from the goddess, but still contains a strong divine power.*\n> *It destroys evil and humans can't bear this divine power.*\n> *Depending on the use, it might become a drug or a poison.*\n> *Weight: 0*\n\n\"Incredible...\"\n\nGrid brought the bundle closer, studying it with new eyes. The cotton-like texture resolved into individual strands—each one impossibly thin and faintly translucent. Divine hair that had fallen from a goddess.\n\n*The statues and portraits show her as a great beauty. Beautiful women do have soft, downy hair.*\n\nHe set the thought aside. The goddess's appearance didn't matter. What mattered was the solution in his hands.\n\n\"Believe in me,\" Grid said, meeting Isabel's and Damian's gazes in turn.\n\nThe spear demanded its wielder's vitality—a curse disguised as power. He would transform it into something worthy of the light goddess's blessing. But he needed help.\n\nOne person specifically.\n\nGrid pulled up his interface and opened a whisper.\n\n—*Sehee, what are you doing?*\n\n—*I'm comforting the families of those sacrificed to summon the great demon.*\n\nOf course. Saintesses were obligated to perform good deeds daily. Failure meant losing the class. Sehee treated her responsibilities seriously, always volunteering within the game.\n\n—*I'm sending you my location. Come help me. I need your strength.*\n\nRuby had earned a special reward for destroying the great demon's soul during the raid. Grid had high hopes for what that power could do.\n\n***\n\n\"So this is Reidan.\"\n\n\"How has agriculture developed to this extent in a desert? Everything's green.\"\n\n\"Bah. That crazy farmer's work.\"\n\nBlood Carnival moved through the outskirts like shadows. The worst PK group in Satisfy harbored deep grudges against Grid and Overgeared. None burned hotter than the fury of the White and Black sisters.\n\nGrid had ruined their Siren invasion. Worse, Black had lost the <span class=\"unique\">Ring of Absurdity</span>—her finest accessory—because of him.\n\nThey'd waited for this opportunity, monitoring the war between Overgeared and the Eternal Kingdom with hungry eyes. Their intelligence network—the finest in the game—had revealed the crucial weakness.\n\nReidan stood nearly empty.\n\nWhite, whose abilities rivaled Grid and Kraugel, smiled with predatory satisfaction. \"I'll strip away everything Grid holds dear.\"\n\nBlack, thin and gloomy beside her brilliant sister, nodded once. \"Yes. We'll make him suffer a pain far greater than what we endured.\"\n\nInformation flowed to Blood Carnival constantly, traded from dozens of sources. The sisters knew Reidan's current state intimately.\n\n*Overgeared's top powers are scattered across multiple battlefields.*\n\n*The mad farmer and his companions are deployed elsewhere.*\n\n*Only a thousand soldiers guard the city—average level 100.*\n\nNothing could stop them. The sisters had confidence in their combined strength. If they'd worked together during the Siren invasion, Grid and his guild would never have humiliated them.\n\n\"Grid!\" White's voice rang with vicious promise. \"I'll make you weep tears of blood!\"\n\n**BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!**\n\nThe desert trembled as the sisters burst into motion. Dust clouds exploded in their wake.\n\nReidan—and Irene—would soon face disaster."
