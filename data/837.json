  "content": "\"I won't forget this! Never!\" Kir's scream echoed across the battlefield as his body dissolved into gray ash, eyes burning with a hatred that promised vengeance.\n\nGrid's expression remained impassive. He understood the weight of making an enemy—understood it intimately, in fact. He'd carried enough grudges in his past to know how they festered, how they inevitably came back to haunt you.\n\n*I've become someone's target now.*\n\nThe higher he climbed, the more he had to lose.\n\n\"Was that wise? Pushing him that far?\" Jishuka's voice carried a note of genuine concern.\n\nGrid met her worried gaze without flinching. \"What choice did I have?\"\n\nKir had been a potential threat. But Grid's actions today had been justified. Given that, crushing him completely was the only logical move. Showing mercy would only invite a more dangerous retaliation later. In this world, alliances formed and shattered daily. Players betrayed each other without hesitation.\n\n\"It's survival,\" Grid said flatly. \"I won't give an enemy room to breathe.\"\n\nHe couldn't afford to show weakness. Not when a second or third Immortal could emerge to threaten everything—everyone—he'd built.\n\n*I'll grind them into dust before they even think about revenge.*\n\nThe cold resolve in Grid's eyes sent a ripple of unease through the watching guild members. Chris, however, wore a satisfied smile. As former leader of the Seven Guilds, he recognized the qualities of true leadership.\n\n*A leader must be ruthless with enemies.*\n\nIn Satisfy's cutthroat world, mercy was a weakness that got you killed. Grid's approach was exactly right.\n\nMeanwhile, Grid examined the unicorn's status window.\n\n---\n\n> **[Unicorn]**\n> \n> *A legendary divine creature from the East Continent. Extremely aggressive and difficult to tame. Possesses a temperament that adores women and despises men.*\n> \n> **Name:** Not Set  \n> **Level:** 189  \n> **Affinity:** -110/100\n> \n> **Health:** 40,000/40,000  \n> **Mana:** 80,000/80,000  \n> **Defense:** 1,980\n> \n> *Barding can be equipped.*\n> \n> **Status:** Sad and petulant.  \n> *(Master gave me many girlfriends, then abandoned me. And now he's given me away to add insult to injury. Even worse, my new master is male. How irritating.)*\n> \n> **—Skills—**\n> \n> **[Unicorn's Blessing (Passive)]**  \n> Increases resource recovery of all riders by 20%. Female riders receive an additional 30% increase.\n> \n> **[Sprint]**  \n> Move 60 meters per second for up to 3 seconds. Unicorn and riders enter a super armored state, resisting all conditions except physical status effects. Female riders extend duration to 5 seconds.  \n> *Cooldown: 2 minutes*  \n> *Mana Cost: 4,900*\n> \n> **[Jump]**  \n> Jump up to 10 meters. Avoid all attacks and obstacles during the leap.  \n> *Cooldown: 5 minutes*  \n> *Mana Cost: 7,800*\n> \n> **[Repel]**  \n> Attack with horn, dealing 10,000 fixed damage and knocking back target.  \n> *Cooldown: 30 seconds*  \n> *Mana Cost: 1,500*\n> \n> **[Male Hatred]**  \n> The unicorn hates all males regardless of species. If the owner is male, affinity decreases by 1 point daily. Affinity can only be increased through constant contact with women.\n\n---\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid stared at the creature.\n\nThe unicorn was objectively beautiful—elegant white coat, graceful neck, pristine horn. Its large black eyes radiated innocence. Nothing about its appearance matched the vicious description in the status window.\n\n*Is this a bug?*\n\nGrid reached out tentatively to stroke the unicorn's face.\n\n*Thud!*\n\nThe horn slammed into his chest.\n\n> **[You have suffered 10,000 damage!]**\n\n\"Ugh!\" The unfamiliar sensation of pain made Grid grimace. His defense was usually high enough to shrug off most attacks.\n\nThe unicorn immediately pranced over to Jishuka, eyes curving into happy crescents. It nuzzled against her chest and licked her cheek.\n\nJishuka laughed, charmed. \"What a friendly creature! You got lucky with this one.\"\n\n\"...You just watched him attack me.\"\n\n\"That was probably affection. What pet attacks its own master?\"\n\nThe status window updated as the unicorn buried its face in Jishuka's chest.\n\n> **Status:** Joyful  \n> *(I didn't expect my ugly new master to have such a gorgeous girlfriend. This is an excellent trade.)*\n> \n> **[Affinity with the unicorn has increased by 10.]**\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid's eye twitched. The blatant double standard was infuriating.\n\n*What kind of sick developer designed this thing?*\n\nWith a resigned sigh, he decided to name the creature. Despite his irritation, he wouldn't resort to petty revenge through nomenclature.\n\n\"Overgeared Corn.\"\n\n> **[The unicorn has been named.]**  \n> **[A bond has formed.]**  \n> **[Affinity has been restored to neutral.]**  \n> **[Affinity: 0/100]**\n\n*That happy about a name?*\n\nGrid studied the unicorn with grudging appreciation. Perhaps there was some sincerity beneath the attitude.\n\nThe Overgeared members, however, thought the unicorn looked even more miserable than when it had lost its previous master.\n\n---\n\n\"Thank you for saving us.\"\n\nThe 12 Te—elite representatives from the twelve elven clans—bowed toward Grid. For these proud creatures, such deference to a human was unprecedented.\n\nGrid felt more awkward than flattered. \"There's nothing to thank. I told you—I'm repaying the favor I owe Sticks.\"\n\nDeruyaru, noticeably younger than the other elves, grasped Grid's hands. \"What exactly is your relationship with Sage Sticks? Do you know where he is now?\"\n\nA century ago, the revered high elf Sticks had departed the forest before the catastrophe that split their home in two. For decades since, male and female elves had maintained separate villages around the World Tree, passing each other without acknowledgment.\n\nThe 12 Te found the situation intolerable. Their birth rate had plummeted. The survival of their species hung in the balance.\n\nBut the king, dwelling with the male elves, dismissed their concerns. He refused any reconciliation, while the female elves matched his stubbornness with their own.\n\nIf only Sticks would return... He could reason with the king, lay the groundwork for reunification...\n\nThe 12 Te desperately needed him. This crisis had only intensified that need. Had Sticks been present, they never would have fallen for the human trafficker's trap.\n\n\"Sticks is a dear friend,\" Grid explained. \"Right now, he's living in the Overgeared Kingdom as my guest.\"\n\n\"Sticks dwells in a human kingdom...\" The elves exchanged troubled glances.\n\nGrid frowned. \"Wait. You didn't know? He visited recently.\"\n\nSticks had come to the forest seeking ingredients for Khan's antidote. But the elves seemed genuinely ignorant of this.\n\nThe 12 Te stirred with confusion. \"Sticks was here? Recently?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then...\" They huddled together, whispering urgently.\n\n\"He must have gone to the king's village.\"\n\n\"Of course. That wretched fool probably poisoned Sticks' mind with lies.\"\n\n\"Sticks doesn't know the truth of our situation.\"\n\nThey turned back to Grid with grave expressions.\n\n\"Please, ask Sticks to return to the forest. Tell him to meet with the 12 Te directly—not the king.\"\n\n\"Uh... sure. I can do that.\"\n\n*What kind of drama is this?*\n\nCalling their own king \"wretched\" suggested deep dysfunction. Grid wanted no part of elven politics. But he couldn't leave yet—not when the World Tree itself had summoned him.\n\n*Maybe it wants to thank me for saving the elves. That could mean serious rewards...*\n\nAnticipation building, Grid followed the elves toward their village. He failed to notice Beniyaru trailing behind the group, her eyes burning with emotions distinctly different from the other 12 Te—emptiness mingled with smoldering rage.\n\nThen a notification flashed across everyone's vision.\n\n> **[The one who leads the dead has been born again as a legend!]**  \n> **[The world will fall into panic!]**\n\nA world message. But the phrasing was unusual—\"born again,\" \"leads the dead.\" Only one person fit that description.\n\nGrid and the Overgeared members froze mid-step.\n\n\"Agnus...\"\n\n---\n\n*\"—sculptor Polish, who rose to prominence at his debut, revealed he learned his craft through Satisfy. Experts across multiple fields claim skill acquisition within the game is genuine. Organizations and governments worldwide are now investing in Satisfy-based training programs. The S.A. Group—\"*\n\nThe television droned on in the darkness of the massive castle, its light flickering against stone walls. The capsule hissed open. A gaunt, pale figure emerged and draped a robe over his naked frame.\n\nAgnus.\n\nHis exhausted eyes fixed on the large portrait dominating the room's center. The woman smiled out at him—genuinely happy in that captured moment, all traces of the misery that had driven her to suicide carefully erased.\n\n\"Soon,\" Agnus whispered. \"We'll be together again soon.\"\n\nThree years of relentless effort had finally borne fruit. His growth-type hidden class, Baal's Contractor, had ascended to legendary rating. More importantly, he'd gained the skill he'd been chasing all along.\n\n**Creation.**\n\n\"Caroline... I will remake you.\"\n\nHe didn't care about the cost. Didn't care if it was illusion rather than reality. He would resurrect his lover—the woman driven to death because of him. And when he succeeded, this wretched reality would become the lie instead.\n\nAgnus pressed his cheek against the portrait and closed his eyes."
