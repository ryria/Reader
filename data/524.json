  "content": "The Seven Guilds were no longer a topic of conversation.\n\nOne force had proven itself stronger than all seven combined, and from that moment, their prestige crumbled. The title of \"strongest\" slipped from their grasp as guild members flooded them with withdrawal requests rather than applications.\n\n\"We're removing ourselves from the alliance.\"\n\nBondre, France's representative and master of Ice Flower, delivered his declaration without ceremony. Until his defeat at Grid's hands during the National Competition, he'd held the nickname \"Undefeated\"—the 1st ranked ice mystic commanding the continent's most powerful magician collective.\n\nThe remaining guild leaders offered no resistance. But Bondre's withdrawal proved the catalyst. One by one, the other masters announced their departures. Why cling to an alliance that had outlived its purpose?\n\nEven Zibal, the alliance's founder, let them go.\n\n\"I won't stop them.\" His voice held none of its former arrogance.\n\nThe 2nd National Competition had changed him. He'd entered that tournament believing himself unmatched in raids and hunting—the absolute best. Grid had shattered that delusion along with his ribs. *I'm not the best. Never was.* The realization stripped away his right to self-importance, to force his will on others.\n\nZibal released his grip on the Seven Guilds and chose a different path: growth. As the last guild formally withdrew, he stood before the entrance to the Behen Archipelago and laughed—a sound edged with anticipation rather than bitterness. Then he stepped through.\n\n***\n\n\"What happens to us now?\"\n\nUnease rippled through Ice Flower's thirty elite magicians. They were specialists—powerful, but specialized. Leaving the alliance meant facing old enemies without backup, navigating disadvantageous trades without production players to offset their weaknesses.\n\nBondre's calm voice cut through the worry. \"We're joining the God of War. Our future there will be brighter than anything we had before.\"\n\n\"God of War?\" Multiple voices overlapped. \"Who's that?\"\n\n\"Ares.\" Bondre met their confused stares. \"An unofficial ranker with unique abilities. He's on Grid's level.\"\n\nStunned silence.\n\n*How strong must he be for Master Bondre to make that comparison?* \n\n\"Then why haven't we heard of him?\"\n\n\"Exactly. If he's that powerful—\"\n\n\"Satisfy is vast,\" Bondre interrupted. \"Do you know every exceptional person in every field in reality? Of course not. There are countless talents hidden in the world, and this virtual realm mirrors that truth.\"\n\nBondre himself had been ignorant of Ares's existence until three days ago, when Scott contacted him with information that had left him genuinely shocked. Now, as he led his guild down the road toward their new future, his thoughts focused on—\n\n\"Yes, the world is wide.\" An unfamiliar voice sliced through his contemplation. \"But you're all beneath my feet.\"\n\n\"Who—?\"\n\nIce Flower snapped to battle formation. Dozens of skeletons materialized from nowhere, blocking the road back to their territory. The voice continued, dripping with malice.\n\n\"Bondre. Become a sacrifice for the king.\"\n\n*Chill.*\n\nEvery member of Ice Flower felt it—an icy dread that had nothing to do with magic. The madness saturating that voice triggered something primal, an instinctive terror.\n\n*Entering a fear state just from his words?* Bondre's mind raced. *A boss monster? Here, on a road traveled by thousands daily?*\n\nImpossible.\n\n\"Reveal yourself!\"\n\nHe completed the casting for his level 8 Ice Cutter and fired. The spell lanced toward the voice's origin with lethal precision.\n\n*Jeeeong!*\n\nThe razor-edged ice blade stopped mid-flight. Shattered. A curtain of darkness had materialized in an instant, effortlessly negating his magic.\n\n*He blocked that so easily?*\n\n*Swaaah.*\n\nThrough the glittering fragments of destroyed ice, a figure emerged from the dark curtain.\n\n\"Agnus?\"\n\n*Chwaaaak!*\n\nRecognition hit Bondre like a physical blow. With Kraugel, Zibal, and Yura absent from the rankings, Agnus had risen to 3rd place. More importantly, he was the rumored psychopath that even Kraugel avoided confronting.\n\n\"Kikikik!\"\n\nGolden eyes fixed on Bondre like a predator eyeing a cornered rat.\n\n***\n\n\"Hunting grounds this far from the city are a pain. I need to stock up on return scrolls.\"\n\nGrid had originally planned to head back to Pangea when the smithy competition started. But finding Idan's Frying Pan had accelerated his timeline—he needed to build affinity with the chef immediately. The item information made the reason obvious.\n\n> **[Idan's Frying Pan]**\n> \n> Rating: <span class=\"unique\">Unique</span>\n> \n> Durability: 35/260 Attack Power: 89\n> \n> * When equipped, grants **Intermediate Cooking Lv. 2**\n> \n> The moment you use this, you'll become a seasoned chef!\n> \n> A frying pan used for centuries by the Idan family, who embrace a philosophy of cooking. Optimized to draw out unique flavors from any ingredient.\n> \n> Special events occasionally occur due to the accumulated desires of generations of master chefs.\n> \n> When an Idan family member uses this frying pan:\n> * High probability of creating food with buffing abilities\n> * Low probability of creating food that permanently increases stats\n> \n> Condition: You must consume the entire dish without leaving anything behind.\n> \n> Conditions of Use: Beginner Cooking Mastery. Special effects activate only when used by an Idan family member.\n> \n> Weight: 40\n\n*So that's why Kraugel forced himself to eat Idan's cooking four times.*\n\nIdan was a golden goose that laid stat-increasing elixirs. His food might taste like death itself, but his value was astronomical—a one-in-a-million talent.\n\nGrid's decision crystallized. *I'm leaving here with Idan as my personal chef.*\n\n\"Idan!\"\n\nGrid burst into the restaurant on Pangea's North Street, nearly colliding with a waitress.\n\n\"Where's Idan?\"\n\n\"The boss went to gather ingredients.\"\n\n\"Can't he get them delivered?\"\n\n\"Not when he needs rotten liver from jiangshi.\"\n\n\"...Jiangshi rotten liver?\"\n\nA chill crawled down Grid's spine. Idan's Frying Pan was *optimized to draw out the taste of ingredients.* If he cooked rotten liver from an undead creature...\n\n*This is a nightmare.*\n\nHis vision dimmed. *Why the hell is he cooking rotten liver? And from a jiangshi corpse, no less?*\n\nA horrifying thought struck him. *If I recruit him as a full-time chef, do I have to eat this kind of nightmare fuel every single time?*\n\nHe forced himself to breathe. *No. That can't be right. He must make normal dishes sometimes.*\n\n*I'll eat whatever I have to. Or... I'll just tell him what to cook.*\n\nGrid couldn't quite believe his own rationalization. \"Where are the jiangshi?\"\n\n\"South gate, then head north. There's a cemetery with an infestation.\"\n\n\"And Idan's there?\"\n\nBefore Grid could leave the restaurant—\n\n\"Hmm? You are?\"\n\nIdan pushed through the door, carrying a basket filled with something black and reeking. Grid fought down his gag reflex and held out the frying pan.\n\n\"Here's what I promised.\"\n\n\"Hrmm.\"\n\nIdan's expression shifted from skepticism to wonder as he examined his family's heirloom. Clearly, he hadn't expected it to be found in just two days.\n\n\"Oh...! *Ohh!* **Ohhhh!** Unbelievable! You recovered it so quickly!\"\n\nGenuine joy radiated from the chef. The moment his hands closed around the pan's handle, a notification appeared.\n\n> [The quest 'Find the Traces of the Great Hero!' has been completed.]\n> \n> [You have received 30% character experience.]\n> \n> [Affinity with Idan has increased by 10.]\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nOnly 10 affinity? For returning a priceless family heirloom? Grid had expected at least 50.\n\n*What kind of stingy—*\n\n\"Have you eaten yet?\" Idan guided the confused Grid to a table. \"Sit down. I'll treat the person who recovered my family's treasure to a wonderful dinner.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes...\"\n\n*Maybe this is my chance to get stat-increasing food.* Grid sat cautiously, then remembered something critical.\n\n\"Please note that I have a liver allergy.\"\n\n*Translation: Don't you dare serve me anything made with jiangshi liver!*\n\nIdan's expression froze. The warmth drained from his eyes, replaced by ice.\n\n\"Y...es? Is that so?\"\n\nHe clicked his tongue and stalked toward the kitchen. His unfriendly demeanor triggered Grid's worst suspicions.\n\n*Did my affinity just drop?*\n\nIt made terrible sense. Idan must be an NPC who only liked people who ate his dishes—*all* of them. That's why returning the frying pan had only granted 10 affinity. On their first meeting, Grid had left most of the orc cream pie uneaten. The damage was already done.\n\n*This is a disaster.*\n\nTo recruit Idan as a full-time chef required high affinity. How could he raise it without eating Idan's horrific cooking? While Grid spiraled into despair—\n\n\"This is my signature dish, prepared especially for you. Japchae.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nIdan set down a plate of japchae—stir-fried glass noodles, a beloved Korean dish. Even Grid's favorite.\n\n*Okay, thank god. How bad could japchae be?*\n\nVegetables, meat, and translucent noodles. Grid grabbed a generous portion with his chopsticks and shoved it into his mouth without hesitation.\n\nThen immediately spat it out.\n\nThe vegetables tasted like *dirt*—raw, crunchy, unwashed. The barely-cooked pork was cold and rubbery. The noodles had the texture of overcooked rubber bands. Nothing strange in the ingredients themselves, but the individual flavors clashed violently instead of harmonizing. It was as if Idan had deliberately extracted the worst possible taste from each component.\n\n\"This is—\"\n\nGrid nearly cursed out loud, but Idan's glare stopped him cold. Those eyes were fixed on the rejected japchae with dangerous intensity.\n\n\"Did you spit it out because it doesn't suit your tastes?\"\n\n\"No! It's delicious!\" Grid's smile felt like it might crack his face. \"I was so surprised by how delicious it was that I accidentally spat some out!\"\n\n*Endure. You have to endure this.*\n\nGrid pinched his nose shut and shoveled the entire remaining portion into his mouth at once.\n\n*Chew, chew.*\n\nHis face went pale as he forced his jaw to work. Idan watched with narrowed eyes.\n\n\"Why are you blocking your nose while eating?\"\n\n\"It's my eating habit.\"\n\n\"Huh. Really? What an unusual habit.\"\n\n*Your cooking is more unusual, you culinary terrorist...*\n\nSweat beaded on Grid's forehead as he swallowed the last rubbery bite.\n\n> [The effect of consuming Idan's dish has permanently increased **Intelligence** by 1.]\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nIt was the moment when Grid's sorrow overwhelmed his joy."
