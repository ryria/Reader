I can no longer delay your execution.\"\n\nThe Lava Prison's oppressive heat did nothing to warm the Cho King's words. Han Seokbong, hearing his sovereign's pronouncement, lowered his head in acceptance.\n\n\"I am a man who deserves death. Your Majesty, release your burden and do what must be done.\"\n\nSilence stretched between them. The king's gaze remained fixed on his condemned friend—the only friend he'd had since his days as a prince. Han Seokbong had never seen him as merely a monarch. He had loved and respected the man behind the crown, and that friendship now made what came next all the more bitter.\n\n\"Tell me again.\" The king's voice cracked slightly. \"The yangbans of the Hwan Kingdom demand the whereabouts of the Red Phoenix Bow's creator. If you cannot—or will not—provide answers, they will make an example of this entire kingdom. So I ask you one final time... do you truly not know where he is?\"\n\n\"I do not, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"This is madness...\" The king's shoulders sagged. He believed Han Seokbong—he always had. But belief meant nothing against the weight of political reality. The court officials, sensing opportunity in crisis, had turned this into a witch hunt. They screamed accusations of treason, demanding Han Seokbong's head to appease the yangbans' wrath.\n\n*So many have waited for this moment,* the king thought bitterly. *Seokbong's integrity always cast their corruption into sharp relief. They've finally found their excuse.*\n\nThe scales of power had tipped beyond his control.\n\n\"This may be presumptuous of me,\" Han Seokbong said quietly, \"but I beg you... protect my daughter.\"\n\n\"You have my word. I will watch over Sua as much as circumstances allow.\"\n\nShe would lose her noble status—that much was inevitable. But her life would be spared.\n\nThe king turned away, unable to meet his friend's eyes any longer. \"I won't attend your execution. I cannot bear to witness your end.\"\n\n\"May Your Majesty live long and lead our kingdom to prosperity.\"\n\nEven now, facing death, Han Seokbong prayed for his nation's welfare. The king found he had no words left. He fled the prison as quickly as dignity would allow.\n\n---\n\n\"Impressive city.\"\n\nGrid stood in the heart of Kars, capital of the Cho Kingdom, taking in the cultural tapestry around him. Like Pangea, the city was a fusion of architectural styles—Western townhouses standing alongside traditional oriental structures, with the royal palace itself resembling something from the Silla dynasty.\n\n*Larger than Reinhardt, easily.* The thought made sense; only five kingdoms existed on the East Continent, each one dwarfing their Western counterparts in scope and scale.\n\nGrid's hands moved mechanically, cutting cloth with practiced efficiency while his eyes catalogued his surroundings. Beside him, Muto spoke up.\n\n\"I'm going to scout the city before meeting with the king. Need to assess the Cho Kingdom's market situation—better intelligence means better negotiations.\"\n\n\"Good thinking. Don't let me stop you.\"\n\n\"What about you?\"\n\n\"I have someone to find.\"\n\n\"Give me a name. I can help search.\"\n\n\"No need. I already know where they are.\"\n\nMuto paused, then nodded, recognizing the implicit boundary. Grid wasn't sharing quest details. \"Right... one more thing. About the loot we collected on the road here...\"\n\nIt had been a five-day journey. Grid and Muto had slaughtered hundreds of monsters en route to Kars, accumulating a substantial haul. Since Grid was party leader, everything had gone directly into his inventory.\n\nGrid produced a carefully calculated split—eighty-twenty, with himself taking the lion's share. Muto, rather than being offended, looked almost guilty.\n\n\"Grid, you handled most of the fighting. Ninety-ten would be more than fair.\"\n\n\"There were several close calls that would've gone badly without you and your Zentu warriors backing me up. This split is appropriate.\"\n\nMuto's respect deepened. *The Overgeared Guild attracts talent for a reason. Sticking with Grid is the smart play.*\n\nHe made a mental note: when he returned to the West Continent, he'd seek membership in the Overgeared Kingdom. After pledging his future cooperation, Muto departed to begin his reconnaissance.\n\nGrid watched him go, satisfaction warming his expression. He'd successfully invested in Muto's loyalty.\n\n*A slightly generous split now buys goodwill later. Not a bad trade.*\n\nPleased with his own cunning, Grid turned his attention to the main square—and immediately sensed the tension radiating from the crowd of thousands.\n\n*What's this about?*\n\nCuriosity drew him closer.\n\n\"Hear the decree! Viscount Han Seokbong of Pangea has been sentenced to death! The execution will be carried out tomorrow at dawn!\"\n\n\"Han Seokbong? The one with the sterling reputation? Why would they execute a man like that?\"\n\n\"He angered the yangbans of the Hwan Kingdom.\"\n\n\"God above... the *yangbans*...\"\n\n\"Then he might as well be dead already...\"\n\nGrid's blood ran cold. The man he'd come to save would be executed in less than a day.\n\n*Dammit. Too fast. This is happening way too fast.*\n\nHis original plan had required time—reconnaissance of the prison's location and structure, assessment of rescue feasibility, contingency planning. If rescue proved impossible, he'd intended to approach the Cho King directly. But that option had just evaporated.\n\n*If the execution's already scheduled, the king clearly can't or won't intervene. Which means I have to extract Han Seokbong myself. Tonight.*\n\nGrid immediately began gathering intelligence on both Han Seokbong and his daughter Sua. Yang Fei's Pushover Detection skill proved invaluable, allowing her to extract information from susceptible sources with remarkable efficiency.\n\n\"Tsk. I should make sure I'm never that easy to manipulate,\" Grid muttered, completely unaware that Yang Fei had once categorized him as exactly that type of target.\n\n---\n\nNoble Sam Dasoo descended to the Lava Prison's second level, ostensibly to visit the prisoner housed there—Sua, daughter of the condemned Han Seokbong.\n\n\"W-What? My father's execution has been confirmed?\"\n\nEven after a fortnight in this filthy cell, Sua retained an ethereal beauty. She shone like white jade in the darkness, moonlight made flesh. The effect was magnetic, impossible for most men to resist. Sam Dasoo swallowed hard, his eyes crawling over her body with poorly disguised hunger.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" he confirmed. \"At dawn.\"\n\n\"That can't be...\" Sua's composure fractured. Her father had devoted his entire life to serving the kingdom, and now he faced execution simply for offending the yangbans? The injustice of it threatened to choke her. \"How is this possible? We are citizens of the Cho Kingdom, subjects of the Cho King! Why do our lives hang on the whims of foreign nobles? *Why?*\"\n\n\"You're young. You don't understand how the world works.\" Sam Dasoo's tone was condescending. \"The Hwan Kingdom is the sky itself. They are the power we all must acknowledge. Anyone who offends them faces consequences.\"\n\nSua's jaw tightened, but she said nothing.\n\n\"But don't worry too much.\" Sam Dasoo leaned closer to the bars, his voice taking on a falsely sympathetic tone. \"I, Sam Dasoo, have personally petitioned to spare your life. It would be too cruel for you to suffer for your father's mistakes. You'll lose your noble status, naturally, but you'll live.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"And you needn't worry about your future livelihood. You'll remain at my side, under my protection. I'll ensure you want for nothing.\"\n\nThe naked lust in his eyes made his intentions crystal clear. Sua met his gaze directly, her bewitching stare momentarily robbing him of coherent thought.\n\n\"I am grateful for Lord Sam Dasoo's benevolence.\"\n\n\"Ah? Y-Yes, yes. Haha, trust in me. Everything will work out.\"\n\n\"Then if you truly wish to help me... let me see my father. I need to say goodbye. One final time.\"\n\n\"Ah? Yes, of course... Guard! Open the cell and—n-no, wait!\" Sam Dasoo caught himself mid-order. He'd nearly fallen completely under her spell. But beneath Sua's beauty was a trained warrior. If she got out of that cell, there was no telling what she might attempt. \"Actually, that won't be possible right now.\"\n\nSua's expression hardened, then twisted into something close to contempt. \"If only I had my cosmetics,\" she muttered.\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\nFor an instant, Sam Dasoo thought he'd misheard. The venomous look in Sua's eyes vanished, replaced by the mask of a fragile, helpless maiden. The transition was so smooth it seemed like a hallucination.\n\n\"It's simply... unbearable that I cannot see my father before he dies.\"\n\n\"D-Don't distress yourself. Tomorrow, before the execution, I'll arrange for you to say your goodbyes.\"\n\nSam Dasoo offered an awkward laugh and retreated hastily. He'd made a tactical error, allowing his lust to override his judgment. Once alone, Sua stopped performing. She bit her nails, mind racing.\n\n*What do I do? Father's execution is tomorrow. I can't let this happen. The only option is to break him out before dawn. But how?*\n\n\"I'm useless...\"\n\nThe tears came then, hot and bitter. She wrapped her arms around her knees, shoulders shaking. Without an audience, she had no need to pretend strength.\n\n---\n\n\"The Cho King has submitted his report. He's executing Han Seokbong, who maintains he doesn't know the identity of the Red Phoenix Bow's creator.\"\n\n\"And he thinks that settles the matter? Pathetic.\"\n\n\"Fools. We don't care about one man's death.\"\n\nIn a luxurious VIP chamber within the Cho King's Palace, several young people reclined on silk cushions worth more than most citizens earned in a year. The yangbans of the Hwan Kingdom.\n\n\"The Red Phoenix Bow was Pagma's work. I don't know how he's survived since leaving the Hwan Kingdom, but we need to locate him.\"\n\n\"If Han Seokbong dies without revealing Pagma's whereabouts, we'll have to begin the search ourselves.\"\n\n\"I'm curious to see Pagma again. His swordsmanship was always... entertaining.\"\n\n\"You mean that sword dance technique Hanul had to suppress? Calling it 'swordsmanship' is generous. It was crude at best.\"\n\n\"Keep your voice down. This isn't the Hwan Kingdom. We should maintain appropriate dignity in front of these people.\""
