  "content": "Skunk had grown up surrounded by cinematic greatness—the inevitable consequence of being a filmmaker's son. His childhood had been filled with the classics: a mafia don torn between family and empire; a brilliant prodigy who wielded wealth like a weapon; an archaeologist racing Nazis for ancient treasures; a middle-aged nobody who shaved his head to save one local child.\n\nThese protagonists had shaped him, their stories burning themselves into his soul. By the time he entered drama school, his path was set. He lived a thousand lives on stage and screen—hero and villain, explorer and salaryman, idealist and drifter.\n\nThe roles gave him something his ordinary life never could: possibility. The explorer characters spoke to him most deeply, awakening dreams of uncharted territories and virgin frontiers. But reality offered no such romance. The age of discovery had ended centuries ago. Every corner of Earth had been mapped, catalogued, conquered. Space remained, but space was for billionaires and astronauts, not second-rate actors scraping by on minor roles.\n\nThen Satisfy arrived.\n\nA new world. An entire frontier waiting to be explored. For Skunk, it was salvation—his chance to become the Indiana Jones he'd always pretended to be. Over the years since launch, he'd built a reputation uncovering Satisfy's hidden secrets.\n\n[The Great Explorer's Knowledge and Intuition is activated!]\n\nThe Sword Grave stretched before him—a vast plain where the legendary blacksmith Pagma had allegedly spent his final years. Thousands of blades jutted from the earth like a steel forest, their rusted edges catching the light.\n\nNothing else. No shelter, no forge, no tools.\n\n*He lived here?*\n\nThe absence troubled Skunk. Where were the basic necessities? The signs of habitation?\n\n*Someone must have cleared the site.*\n\nBut no. His trained eye detected no evidence of erasure. The plain had simply... always been empty.\n\n*Then how did Pagma survive?* \n\nHad the legendary blacksmith endured every season exposed to the elements—scorching summers, frozen winters, spring rains and autumn winds—with no protection whatsoever?\n\n*No. That's insane.*\n\nThe weathering patterns were wrong. After hundreds of years, even careful removal would leave traces. The only logical conclusion: No one had ever lived here at all.\n\n\"There's nothing!\" one of his subordinates called out.\n\n\"Same here,\" another confirmed.\n\n\"This isn't a dwelling site.\"\n\n\"The rumors about Braham being buried here must be false.\"\n\nTheir reports matched his own assessment. The Sword Grave offered no clues—except for the swords themselves.\n\nSkunk gripped one of the thousands of blades. It didn't budge. These were props, immutable scenery that players couldn't affect. He moved to another sword. Then another.\n\n*Wait.*\n\nOne blade shifted when he pulled. Just slightly, but it moved.\n\n*Can I actually wield these?*\n\nHis pulse quickened. This was Pagma's final workshop—supposedly. What if the legendary blacksmith had left something behind? The site's very name suggested its nature: the Sword Grave, where Pagma had discarded thousands of failed creations. Garbage to a legendary craftsman.\n\nBut trash to a legend might be treasure to anyone else.\n\n*These \"failures\" could be epic-rated. Maybe unique.*\n\nHis hands trembled with excitement. Weapons crafted by Pagma himself, even flawed ones, would be extraordinary. The performance alone would be remarkable, and the historical value... \n\nAs an explorer, this discovery could launch him into the top ranks.\n\n*The money won't hurt either.*\n\n\"Check every sword!\" Skunk shouted to his team. \"Not a single blade gets missed!\"\n\n\"What?\" His subordinates exchanged bewildered glances. Check all of them? The swords had been weathering for years—most would be corroded, worthless.\n\n*This will take forever.*\n\n*Waste of time.*\n\nBut Skunk was already working, methodically testing each sword in sequence. His team's grumbling faded as they watched him move with purpose.\n\nThen—\n\n\"What the hell?\"\n\nThe 134th sword. When Skunk twisted its handle, the blade rotated half a turn in its earthen socket. It didn't pull free, but unlike the previous 133 swords, it actually moved.\n\nHis heart hammered against his ribs. As the sword rotated, other blades shifted slightly. The ground beneath them trembled, plates of stone sliding into new configurations.\n\n\"Did you all see that?\" Skunk's grin spread across his face as he met his colleagues' eyes. \"We're arranging them into a cube pattern! This might take days. Hell, it might take months!\"\n\n\"Let's do it!\" The explorers erupted in cheers, their earlier complaints forgotten. They'd found the thread—now they just had to follow it to whatever secrets or treasures waited at the end.\n\nEach sword's rotation affected the ground differently. Some caused major shifts, others returned sections to their starting positions. The mechanism was fiendishly complex, potentially requiring months to solve.\n\nSkunk and his team had never been more excited.\n\n***\n\n—*Hexetia's envy brought suffering to countless humans and endangered all of humanity. His sins are profound. Can you forgive him?*\n\nGrid stood in silence, the weight of divine revelation heavy on his shoulders. The gods weren't what the world believed them to be. Now came his choice: Would he inherit the Fourth Evil's rebellion against the heavens? Or would he turn away from the truth as he had before?\n\nIn S.A. Group's monitoring center, Morpheus's voice filtered through the speakers. —*Player Grid has a 61.8% probability of inheriting the Fourth Evil's will.*\n\nChairman Lim Cheolho straightened in his seat. \"61.8%? Only a 40% chance he refuses?\"\n\nThe current scenario's ultimate reward was the Fourth Evil itself—the power to challenge the gods directly. Grid would unlock it by declaring the gods unforgivable, strengthening God's Command in ways he'd missed during the Crossroads of Good and Evil quest.\n\nRefusal offered nothing except keeping Rebecca's blessing. By every logical calculation, Grid should accept. The blessing was valuable, but God's Command enhancement was transformative.\n\n\"Did his previous experience affect the probability?\" Lim Cheolho mused. \"He already gave up the half-god class once.\"\n\n—*Correct. Analysis of his prior behavior suggested a 97% probability of accepting half-god status, as he typically avoids severe penalties. The outcome contradicted predictions.*\n\n\"Because the penalties would've affected his companions, not just him.\"\n\nGrid's defining characteristic: he protected those around him. Family, friends, allies—he'd proven repeatedly that their welfare outweighed his personal advancement.\n\nOn the monitor, Grid spoke: \"I... It's fine. I get envious too, sometimes. Who am I to judge Hexetia? To forgive or condemn a god?\"\n\n—*The scales are incomparable. You are mortal. He is divine. Hexetia's envy threatens your entire species. Will you still forgive his crimes?*\n\n\"Yes, he's a god.\" Grid's expression remained steady. \"Which means his envy can endanger all of humanity because he's powerful enough to do it.\"\n\n—*...What?*\n\n\"If Hexetia were weaker than me, maybe I'd condemn him. But he's stronger, so I'm smart enough to keep my head down.\"\n\n—*You! Coward!*\n\n\"Can't help it. I'm responsible for my family, not the human race.\" The smile faded from Grid's eyes, replaced by steel. \"So right now, I'll avoid him. But if his envy ever threatens my family? I'll take responsibility. I'll fail, I'll die, I'll resurrect and try again, over and over until I destroy him. Selfish? Probably. But that's who I am.\"\n\n—*...*\n\nThe Seventh Evil's presence wavered and dispersed. The visions of the past collapsed around Grid. He had refused the Seventh Evil's inheritance again—but this time, he'd gained awareness of a potential divine enemy while expressing his principles with unflinching honesty.\n\n[The Seventh Evil has become interested in Player Grid.]\n\n[Affinity with the Seventh Evil: +10]\n\n\"Affinity with the Seventh Evil?\" Lim Cheolho stared at the notification in disbelief. \"The intelligence of the Seven Malignant Saints—isolated for centuries—has evolved this far?\"\n\nHis hands trembled slightly as the implications settled over him."
