  "content": "# Chapter: The King's Burden\n\nEvery role carried responsibilities. None were insignificant. For a king tasked with governing an entire nation, those responsibilities were especially grave.\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\nBefore logging into Satisfy, Sehee shared breakfast with her family.\n\n\"What?\" Youngwoo raised his head from where he'd been eating grilled eel, looking at his sister with mild confusion.\n\nSehee's brow furrowed with concern. \"I saw on the news that you're incredibly busy as king. You have to pay attention to politics, economics, diplomacy, education, the arts... Experts were worried that an average person's physical health might—\"\n\nShe placed a piece of eel on his rice bowl as she spoke. Their parents exchanged worried glances.\n\n\"Youngwoo, you shouldn't skip meals even when you're busy,\" their mother said gently. \"Please get enough sleep and eat plenty of broccoli.\"\n\nTheir father nodded. \"How can it not be exhausting, taking responsibility for hundreds of thousands of lives? But don't forget—you're someone's precious family member. You need to take care of your health.\"\n\n\"You don't need to worry.\" Youngwoo scooped up a large spoonful of rice, eel, and broccoli, then laughed. \"All the busy and complicated tasks are being handled by Lauel. Your precious son isn't having a hard time at all. Hahaha!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*If Lauel lived nearby, we'd give him some health supplements...* Youngwoo's parents felt immense gratitude toward Lauel, while Sehee's concern took a different direction.\n\n*That cold-blooded person is exploiting the people again, isn't he?*\n\nShe had no doubt that Lauel was suffering on her brother's behalf—his abilities were undeniable. But Sehee suspected there was a problem with Lauel's attitude toward the common folk.\n\n*I'll protect the people in the name of the Saintess!* she resolved silently.\n\nOf course, only so long as it didn't hold her brother back.\n\n***\n\n**Rebecca Temple**\n\nThe magnificent temple built directly beside Reinhardt Palace offered a breathtaking view when bathed in morning sunlight. The stone statue of Goddess Rebecca at the temple's center seemed to smile more intensely as the marble floor transformed into waves of shimmering silver.\n\n\"...Goddess Rebecca.\"\n\nA young man bowed before the statue. Blue eyes glinted through silver hair.\n\n\"When I woke this morning, there were exactly two hundred and three strands of hair on my pillow. It took me seven minutes to count them.\" His voice cracked slightly. \"Is this really hair loss? Can it not be restored with the power of the benevolent goddess? Will this wound last for eternity?\"\n\nOne month had passed since the kingdom's founding. The Overgeared Kingdom was developing without major difficulties. Using the existing forces of Overgeared and Duke Steim's troops, the Eternal territory had been thoroughly defended and absorbed, incorporating the Eternal people in the process.\n\nAdditionally, domestic affairs in both Reinhardt and Reidan were progressing steadily. Many new facilities had been constructed, and as a result, player immigrants were beginning to emerge. The Siren Kingdom had been politically incorporated into the Overgeared Kingdom, and diplomatic relations had been established with the Fold Kingdom.\n\nAll of this was Lauel's work. Having endured tremendous fatigue and mental strain during this arduous endeavor, Lauel was convinced his hair had thinned noticeably.\n\n\"I wonder if Miss Ruby could still see me as an angel now... an angel who's lost his wings...\"\n\nLauel still had plenty of hair, objectively speaking. That wasn't the issue. What mattered was the highly probable trajectory—he was *losing* hair.\n\n\"Ahh... Now my heart is like a stormy sea, desperately in need of a guiding light...\"\n\n\"What are you doing every morning?\"\n\n\"...!!\"\n\nLauel shot upright from his prayer position before the statue. He spun around to find Grid standing behind him. Grid wore his newly crafted crown, radiating the elegant bearing of a king.\n\n\"You're here, my King.\"\n\n\"I told you not to talk like that when there aren't any NPCs around...\" Grid's eyes narrowed. \"What? You... Why do your eyes look so dead?\"\n\n\"Should I tell you honestly?\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"It's too hard these days.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"Please help me.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nGrid was genuinely startled. He'd never imagined Lauel would actually *ask* for his help.\n\n*This person usually refuses any assistance...* The burden must be crushing him right now.\n\nThe apologetic Grid laid a hand on Lauel's shoulder. \"Just say the word. I won't shirk my responsibilities.\"\n\n\"If so, then make the quests...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nQuest creation was a privilege of nobles and the king. They could generate quests as needed and announce them to players. The applications were infinite—quests could serve the needs of nobles and royalty, like Great Magician Ashur's quest for Pagma's Rare Book, or they could be designed purely for the growth of players and NPCs.\n\nWas it difficult? No, it was remarkably simple.\n\nThus, Grid felt somewhat disappointed.\n\n\"It's just this...\"\n\n\"Simple labor from the boss is the greatest gift.\"\n\n\"...Understood. To be honest, it's too demanding for you to handle this daily.\"\n\nLauel was a top-tier strategist. He wasn't suited for simple, repetitive labor. Grid accepted willingly.\n\n\"Okay, leave today's quest quota to me.\"\n\n\"You should consider the players' and NPCs' levels when creating quests. Also our financial status. We're quite poor.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay. Don't worry, I'll be careful.\"\n\n\"Ah! Don't share the work with Jude! The kingdom will be ruined if you do!\"\n\n\"I understand!\"\n\n*Borrow Jude's hand?* Grid made an indignant sound at the mere suggestion.\n\nAfter giving his morning greetings to Queen Irene and Prince Lord, he headed straight to his office.\n\n\"Quest Creation.\"\n\n> [You can generate quests using the authority of the Overgeared King.]\n\n> [The national rating of the kingdom is **F**. The total number of quests available per day is **8,000**. (**3,940**/**8,000**)]\n\n\"It's morning, yet nearly half have already been created.\"\n\nIt meant the Overgeared members scattered across the kingdom were doing their utmost.\n\n\"I should pull my weight.\"\n\nGrid studied the system window intently.\n\n> [A king is not dependent on territory. You can announce quests throughout the kingdom.]\n\n> [A king is not dependent on financial status. You can create high-level quests without restrictions. However, please be cautious of accumulating debt.]\n\n\"Need to save money now...\"\n\nIt would be prudent to create F~E rank quests that consumed around 10~20 gold. Most players in the Overgeared Kingdom were still low level.\n\n\"But this won't satisfy mid-to-high level players, so I need to mix in an adequate number of D-A grade quests.\"\n\nTen gold equaled 12,000 won in real currency. That meant creating even the lowest F-grade quest cost the equivalent of two bowls of jajangmyeon. C-grade quests required 100 gold. Yet the Overgeared Kingdom generated 8,000 quests daily. Was this financially sustainable?\n\nOf course it was possible. When a player cleared a kingdom-generated quest, the kingdom was also rewarded. There was a 50% refund on gold spent during quest creation, plus additional rewards based on quest completion rates.\n\nFurthermore, goods acquired by players and NPCs as quest rewards would eventually return as taxes. It formed a virtuous cycle. The quest-issuing NPCs would also gain experience from successful quest completions.\n\n\"Create a D-grade quest.\"\n\n> [Please enter the details. The quest contents must be feasible.]\n\nNaturally, the quest contents should contribute to the kingdom's development. Grid recalled the thieves who'd appeared near Reinhardt recently.\n\n\"The remnants of the noble forces... Let's eliminate them.\"\n\n> [The specified targets are over **level 200**. According to scout reports, they are composed of regular soldiers and knights. This cannot be classified as a D-grade quest.]\n\n\"R-Really? Then make it C-grade.\"\n\n> [The specified targets are over **level 200**. According to scout reports, they are composed of regular soldiers and knights. They are too strong to be classified as a C-grade quest. Do you still wish to proceed?]\n\n\"Phew, barely made it.\"\n\nRelief washed over him that it could at least qualify as C-grade. A B-grade quest would consume 300 gold—a significant loss.\n\n\"Good start from the beginning. Huhuhut.\"\n\nGrid smiled as he confirmed the quest creation.\n\n> ['Eliminate the Thieves Near Reinhardt' quest will be announced in the central square.]\n\n> **[Eliminate the Thieves Near Reinhardt]**\n> **Difficulty:** C\n> Overgeared King Grid has commanded the brave citizens of Overgeared to travel to the northern foothills and defeat the thieves. Reinhardt's security rests in your hands.\n> **Quest Clear Rewards:** 500 gold. 3,000,000 experience. One Fallen Knight set item.\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThe rewards for a C-grade quest seemed excessive. Grid was momentarily bewildered before breaking into a grin.\n\n\"Is it because the *king* created the quest?\"\n\nThis was the king's dignity manifesting!\n\n\"Alright! Let's do this! Quest Creation! Quest Creation! Quest Creation!\"\n\nGrid continued generating quests with enthusiasm.\n\nOn this day, Reinhardt fell into utter chaos.\n\n***\n\n**Reinhardt's Central Square**\n\n\"What is this?\"\n\nUsers attempting to receive quests before heading to the hunting grounds doubted their own eyes. The contents of the announced quests were... unusual.\n\n\"Is this quest rating even correct?\"\n\n\"It has to be a bug.\"\n\nThe difficulty of the announced quests was significantly higher than standard quests. F~E grade quests were suitable for players below level 50. D-grade quests for players below level 100. C-grade quests for players below level 150. B-grade quests for players below level 250.\n\nOf course, individual variations existed depending on a player's class and equipment. However, today's announced quests were utterly ludicrous. The D-grade quests resembled C-grade difficulty, while the C-grade quests matched B-grade standards.\n\n\"This is... a new method of torture?\"\n\n\"Is he trying to raise us Spartan-style?\"\n\n\"Look! I told you! There are only crazy people in the Overgeared Guild, and we should've been careful about immigrating to the Overgeared Kingdom! We shouldn't have been deceived by the tax benefits!\"\n\nThe players trembled. They questioned the created quests and looked around nervously.\n\n\"It's acceptable if we attempt a quest with lower-than-usual ratings.\"\n\n\"But the compensation...\"\n\n\"The difficulty is practically B-grade, yet it's classified as C-grade, and the quest reward matches the highest tier of C-grade compensation.\"\n\n\"Oh, the Overgeared Kingdom is garbage.\"\n\n\"No, calm down, everyone.\"\n\nAmidst the torrent of complaints and curses, one player stepped forward. His ID was Coke. He was a prominent figure among the second generation of rookies. Several years ago, he'd been honored with the experience of dying to bones thrown by Piaro in Patrian. Of course, only a small portion of this history was publicly known.\n\n\"The Overgeared Kingdom wouldn't create these quests without careful consideration. We must understand what God Grid is thinking.\"\n\n\"What 'God Grid' nonsense... He's a scammer.\"\n\n\"So the rumor that Coke is a Grid fanboy is actually true.\"\n\nThe voices remained hushed, as if whispering. None of the players spoke loudly enough for Coke to overhear. The average level of players who'd immigrated to the Overgeared Kingdom hovered in the mid-100s. Meanwhile, Coke was level 230. They couldn't afford to antagonize him carelessly.\n\nCoke shared his analysis. \"Quests from a kingdom have special features. We can receive support from soldiers. Understand? God Grid set such a high difficulty level because he *wants* us to cooperate with the soldiers to clear these quests.\"\n\n\"Why would you think that?\"\n\n\"It's obvious. We'll grow faster by challenging difficult quests. It will also raise the soldiers' levels and achieve military enhancement. Think about it—this isn't a loss for us. We gain higher-than-usual quest rewards *and* an opportunity to build favor with the soldiers.\"\n\n\"Isn't this interpretation overly generous? The number of soldiers assigned per quest is limited, isn't it? For example, a C-grade quest only provides two soldier escorts. You want to wipe out the remnants of the nobles with just two soldiers? Does that make any sense?\"\n\n\"Exactly. The E~D grade quests only grant *one* soldier's support. How are we supposed to eliminate ten direwolves like that? Won't we just become dog food?\"\n\nThere was no refuting the players' complaints. Their perspective was cold and brutally realistic. Coke actually sympathized with their concerns. But his pride was too strong to reverse his position after publicly supporting Grid. This was the ego of a second generation rookie.\n\n*Shit...*\n\nIn the end—\n\n\"I believe in God Grid!\"\n\nCoke squeezed his eyes shut before accepting the only B-grade quest available. The 'One Horned Griffin Hunt' required killing five of them. It was impossible for the level 230 Coke to hunt One Horned Griffins, which had a minimum level of 300. However...\n\n\"I believe in God Grid!\"\n\nThere was no turning back now. Coke felt half-desperate as he turned toward the barracks. He selected five soldiers and departed for the griffin nest.\n\nThe other players watched him go. Several followed Coke, eager to witness how the arrogant upstart would suffer alone.\n\nCoke would soon be in tears from the humiliation awaiting him."
