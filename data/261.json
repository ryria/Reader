  "content": "# Chapter 261\n\nPiaro, a legendary farmer? \n\nAbsurd didn't begin to cover it. The idea scraped against Grid's brain like gravel under his boot. *This is paranoia. Actual insanity. Even the worst web novel wouldn't pull this shit.*\n\n*Piaro dreamed of becoming a Sword Saint. Why the hell would he throw that away for... agriculture?*\n\nGrid shook his head. The spike in harvest rates had to come from somewhere else. *He probably picked up some farming tricks as a hobby. That makes sense. He's versatile enough.*\n\n*I'm overthinking this.*\n\nHeat crept up Grid's neck at the thought of Jude silently judging him. He forced a smile, rolling his shoulders back to shake off the spiral of stupid thoughts. Piaro and Asmophel stood a few paces away, the tension between them thick enough to choke on.\n\n\"Let's leave.\" Grid jerked his head toward the exit.\n\nThe Overgeared members followed without question. Damian trailed behind them. Once the space cleared, Piaro and Asmophel began their long-overdue conversation.\n\nThat day, both men made silent vows. Duke Grid had torn away the veil of misunderstanding. He'd shown them the true enemy, pulled them from the pit of misdirected rage. For that, they pledged their loyalty. Eternal. Unbreakable.\n\n***\n\nThe road stretched toward the castle, and Reidan sprawled before Grid like a half-finished painting. The development was striking. Buildings clustered tighter, roads ran straighter, the skyline pushed higher.\n\n*It's definitely better than the old Reidan.*\n\nBut Winston still put it to shame. Reidan had twice the physical space of Winston and old Reidan combined, yet the infrastructure lagged behind. The root problem festered obvious and ugly: population. Rabbit, the administrative genius, could only work miracles with the people he had. No manpower meant slow progress. Simple math.\n\n\"Lauel, what's the plan for the population crisis?\"\n\n\"Same strategy as before.\" Lauel fell into step beside him. \"We secure persecuted minorities from across the empire and offer them sanctuary.\"\n\nLike the Ul Clan. But that well would run dry soon. The method bled the Overgeared members, and the empire wouldn't tolerate the brain drain forever.\n\n\"Any natural growth?\"\n\n\"That...\" Lauel hesitated. \n\nGrid didn't know it yet, but Reidan's name carried weight now. The defense against seven guilds had rippled through the playerbase. Interest spiked. Users were already plotting their migrations, drawn by the promise of a rising power. The problem? Geography. The journey would filter out all but the most determined.\n\n\"Don't rush it,\" Lauel said. \"We finish the mine development first. Connect the roads. Deploy troops along the routes. Monster populations will thin out naturally. After that, it's a waiting game.\"\n\n\"How's the mine development progressing?\"\n\n\"Slow. We're bleeding for skilled workers. Miners especially. It'll take longer than projected.\"\n\n\"Miners...\"\n\n*Minor would be perfect.* The kid had the talent for it. But pavranium came first. Sticking Minor in a hole to dig iron ore felt like using a legendary sword to chop vegetables.\n\n*Where the hell is he, anyway?*\n\nThe boy was mapping labyrinths across the western territories. Grid's gut twisted at the thought of monsters catching him off-guard. Then again, Minor had proven slippery. Too clever to get cornered.\n\n*Stop worrying.*\n\nGrid shifted topics. \"Other guilds have knights divisions yet?\"\n\n\"Knights division?\" Lauel frowned. \"Probably not many? I guess any guild could slap the label on an organized group and call it one. Mass production.\"\n\nHe clearly had no idea the system existed as an actual mechanic.\n\n*So I'm first.*\n\nIt had to be. Named NPCs didn't exactly grow on trees.\n\n*First knights division...*\n\n\"First\" meant something in Satisfy. Titles. Bonuses. Special privileges that separated legends from the pack.\n\n*What's the reward going to be?*\n\nGrid's pulse quickened. Not anxiety. Controlled anticipation. The kind that kept him sharp, kept him from falling back into the pit of failure he'd clawed out of.\n\n\"Duke Grid! Welcome back!\"\n\nAdministrator Rabbit and Jude stood at the castle entrance, alerted to his arrival beforehand. Grid pulled up the Great Lord's Sword interface, scanning their stats. A grin spread across his face.\n\n*They've grown.*\n\nRabbit's Intelligence and Political Power had spiked. Jude showed massive gains in Strength and Stamina. Both had embraced their roles completely.\n\n\"You held down the fort while I was gone.\" Grid clapped their shoulders.\n\nRabbit bowed, humble as ever. Jude snorted like a bull in rut, chest puffing with pride. They flanked Grid as he entered the castle proper. A thousand soldiers snapped to attention in perfect unison.\n\n\"Kingdom's hero! Reidan's sun! We greet the great Duke Grid!\"\n\n\"Attention!\"\n\nThe roar shook dust from the rafters. Grid walked the line, observing.\n\n*They're on par with the empire's soldiers.*\n\nThe growth rate defied logic. Jude's brutally stupid training methods were somehow working. The <span class=\"skill\">I Have No Idea</span> skill lived up to its SS-rank designation. No thoughts, just results. Grid couldn't help but smile.\n\nOne man watched him with laser focus. Damian.\n\n*Now. This is my chance.*\n\nHe'd been waiting for the right moment since Grid arrived in Reidan. The duke seemed relaxed. Happy, even. This was it.\n\n\"Grid! It's been too long!\"\n\nDamian stepped forward, nerves screaming beneath a forced calm exterior. He dropped to one knee.\n\nGrid squinted at him. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Heok.\" The word escaped Damian like a gut-punch. \"You don't remember me?\"\n\nThe urge to cry pressed behind Damian's eyes. Grid stared at the crumbling man before him. *To be fair, he was basically an extra during the pope raid. That was ages ago.*\n\nDamian swallowed the hurt and straightened. \"I am Damian. Paladin of the Rebecca Church. Goddess' Agent. About one year and two months ago in Satisfy time, I provided buffs while you raided Pope Drevigo.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Recognition clicked. The otaku paladin. Grid hadn't appreciated it then, but looking back, Damian's buffing abilities were exceptional.\n\n\"I remember. So why are you here?\"\n\n*Does he want to join Overgeared?* Hope flickered in Grid's chest.\n\n\"Please save Isabel!\"\n\n\"Isabel?\"\n\n*Who?*\n\n*Oh. Right.* One of Rebecca's Daughters. Blonde. Spear user. Exceptional technique. *Did something happen?*\n\n*Wait. Why is he asking me?*\n\n*Oh no.*\n\nIce water flooded Grid's veins. **Lifael's Spear.** The divine weapon sealed by Pagma, wielded only by Rebecca's Daughters. Grid had broken that seal. Then he'd... left. Never returned it. Never checked on the consequences.\n\n*Shit.*\n\nIsabel was dying because of him. Guilt gnawed at Grid's stomach, but worse than that was the looming specter of compensation. Legal damages. Financial ruin.\n\n*I have no money.*\n\n\"I'll give you everything I own!\" Damian's voice cracked. \"Please... please save Isabel!\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\nGrid's brain stuttered. He'd expected demands for restitution, not a desperate bribe. *Is this guy a pushover?*\n\nLauel's whisper cut through Grid's confusion.\n\n-Damian is a pope candidate. Help him. If he takes the throne, Reidan gains an alliance with the Rebecca Church. The value exceeds money.\n\n*Pope candidate...*\n\nGrid had already planned to help. Guilt toward Isabel alone was enough motivation. But there was more. *Lifael's Spear.* A divine weapon. An opportunity to study its construction, its properties. \n\n*Finally.*\n\nA chance to craft divine items. Weapons beyond **Failure**. Beyond even Pagma's works. The potential made Grid's fingers itch.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nDamian blinked, thrown by the sudden question. Grid clarified.\n\n\"How much will you pay me to seal Lifael's Spear?\"\n\nGrid took what he could. Always. That wasn't greed. It was survival. Opportunities slipped through the fingers of fools and pushovers.\n\n*I used to be a pushover.*\n\n\"I have 530,000 gold prepared...\" Damian's voice wavered.\n\nHis deposit. Everything liquid he could scrape together.\n\nGrid's expression stayed neutral. *How much is that?* Quick math. *636 million won.*\n\nDamian's anxiety spiked at the silence. \"I-If I sell my mansion, I can get another 1.2 million gold!\"\n\n\"Mansion?\"\n\n\"Yes! A small one in Tokyo where I live!\"\n\n*He'd sell his real-world house for an NPC?*\n\nOld Grid would've laughed in Damian's face. Mocked him for prioritizing pixels over property. But Grid had changed. Irene, Khan, Piaro—they'd shown him the depth NPCs could reach. The love they could give. Damian's devotion earned respect.\n\n*He's not a bad person.*\n\nJust a pushover. But also a pope candidate. That detail mattered more than immediate profit.\n\n*Long-term investment over short-term greed.*\n\nThis favor would pay dividends when Damian wore the papal crown.\n\n\"I'll take just the 530,000 gold.\"\n\n\"Heok?\"\n\nDamian knew Grid's reputation. Greed incarnate. He'd steeled himself for extortion, prepared to liquidate everything, maybe even sell organs on the black market if it came to that. This generosity shattered his expectations. *Grid isn't evil. He's... generous?*\n\n\"Thank you! I really... thank you!\"\n\nTears streamed down Damian's face. In that moment, Grid looked like salvation itself. An angel willing to spare Isabel from suffering.\n\nGrid, meanwhile, was calculating.\n\n*A chance to study a divine weapon.*\n\nLike finding a lottery ticket on the way to cash in lottery winnings.\n\n***\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms:**  \nOG: Glossary Link  \n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week  \nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
