  "content": "Grid's thoughts drifted back to the forty-first island of the Behen Archipelago. That desolate stage had offered him a simple, brutal challenge—defeat himself or perish.\n\n*The clone.*\n\nThe duplicate had been perfect. It wielded his skills with his exact stats, fought with superior technique, and seamlessly chained sword dances together. It wore identical equipment, commanded the same God Hands—but with far greater mastery. While Grid struggled to issue precise commands to multiple constructs simultaneously, the clone possessed a super named NPC's artificial intelligence, controlling them with flawless coordination.\n\nYet somehow, Grid had prevailed.\n\n*If the clone has God Hands, I can harvest more pavranium from them.* The realization struck him with sudden clarity. Until recently, he'd forgotten about his duplicate entirely, never imagining that the entity he'd destroyed on that island could have survived. Then Yura had informed him: his clone existed in Hell itself, actively searching for him.\n\nThe mechanism became obvious. His dark-skinned doppelgänger had died while in Blackening mode, dragging his soul down to the infernal realm where it somehow persisted.\n\n*That's why Belial reacted so strangely when she saw me.*\n\nNormally, entities that fell to Hell through Blackening would be expelled once the transformation ended. Yet his clone had apparently remained there for years.\n\n*Why?*\n\nThe question had no ready answer. Understanding every game system was impossible for any player. He could only accept the situation and adapt accordingly.\n\n\"Hmm...\" Grid drummed his fingers on the table, mind churning through implications. If his clone truly inhabited Hell, then preserving the Blacksmith Hammer to Go Against the Gods and the Blade Aiming at the Gods made perfect sense. He needed to claim those God Hands at the earliest opportunity.\n\n*Though there's no guarantee they'll drop when I kill him.*\n\nStill, he desperately needed additional God Hands—or more precisely, the pavranium they contained. The gamble was worth taking.\n\nThe problem was simpler: *I don't know how to reach Hell.*\n\nMemory of their previous encounters flooded back. Grid had fallen to his clone multiple times in their early confrontations. The duplicate had been stronger—matching Grid's stats while wielding an artificial intelligence that demonstrated overwhelming combat superiority. \n\nYet in the end, Grid had triumphed. Through Item Creation, he'd forged the Motley Flail and won through sheer, improbable luck.\n\n*I've grown considerably stronger since then.*\n\nHis skills had evolved beyond the clone's original capabilities. Grid had acquired God's Command, earned the First King and Hero King titles, and absorbed the powers of multiple named bosses—Belial, Astaroth—into his rune. The goddess' blessings and the special event triggered by crafting six myth-rated items had fundamentally transformed him. The Grid who entered the forty-first island and the Grid of today existed as entirely different beings.\n\nIf he descended to Hell and confronted his clone now, victory seemed assured.\n\n*I could probably win one-handed.*\n\nThe confidence lasted precisely three seconds.\n\n*Ah... wait.*\n\nHadn't Yura—powerful, skilled Yura—been devastated by a single strike from the clone? Could his duplicate from years ago defeat the current Yura?\n\n*Impossible.*\n\nWas the clone from that time strong enough to rattle the Great Demon Belial herself?\n\n*Absolutely not.*\n\nThe truth crystallized with uncomfortable clarity: his clone had grown stronger alongside him.\n\n*In the worst case scenario...*\n\nThe duplicate might be directly linked to Grid's own development. Perhaps when Grid obtained God's Command, so did the clone. When Grid became the Hero King and gained fighting energy, his shadow might have gained it simultaneously. Given that the clone's fundamental nature involved duplicating Grid's appearance and abilities, the possibility couldn't be dismissed.\n\n*Even so, I can fight.*\n\nGrid refused to shrink back. Even if the clone surpassed him now, he believed in one certainty:\n\n*I can win somehow if I use the Motley Flail again. No need to overthink this.*\n\nUltimately, he would rely on luck once more. That wasn't foolishness or lack of preparation—it was pragmatism. What countermeasures could anyone devise against an unknown enemy of indeterminate strength? Overthinking would only waste precious time.\n\n\"Alright...\" Grid stood decisively. He would descend to Hell and eliminate his clone.\n\n—Yura, I need you to take me to Hell.\n\nThe whisper caught her off-guard. —Are you planning to fight your clone?\n\n—Yes. I can't leave that thing running around. Time to clean up this mess.\n\nGrid's motivations extended beyond mere pavranium greed. The clone derived from him, sharing his essence. Left unchecked, it might eventually influence him in ways he couldn't predict—likely destructive ones. Eliminating the duplicate was his responsibility. He could be forgiven for inaction when ignorant of its survival, but now that he knew, passivity was unacceptable.\n\n—.....\n\nYura fell silent, though not from admiration at Grid's determination.\n\n*Seriously?* As the world's most beautiful woman, Yura received constant praise. Men performed elaborate courtship dances, and everyone carefully measured their words and gestures in her presence.\n\nEveryone except Grid.\n\nGrid had just said \"clean up this mess\" without the slightest hesitation, treating her exactly like one of the guys. Clearly, he saw her as a comfortable friend rather than a woman.\n\n\"Ha...\" She sighed audibly.\n\n—Yura? Did you step away? Why the silence? Ah, is it impossible to transport another person to Hell?\n\n—...No. I can take up to two others. Three total, including myself.\n\n—Three people?\n\nGrid's heartbeat quickened. Despite his bravado about \"cleaning up,\" he'd be lying if he claimed no fear. If the clone proved stronger and killed him, the death penalty would be severe. Fighting alongside allies made infinitely more sense.\n\nOne name immediately came to mind.\n\n—If you can bring one more, let's take Euphemina.\n\nThe only player Grid acknowledged as potentially stronger than himself was the Duplicator. Yura agreed immediately. —Good idea. We can count on her.\n\nUnlike Grid, Yura could objectively assess Euphemina's capabilities. She didn't fear her, but she possessed a solid understanding of her power. Yura recognized that Euphemina ranked among the greatest players, especially when she copied the strongest skills. Add in her mastery of Mumud's magic, and—\n\n*With the three of us together, the clone won't stand a chance.*\n\nYura had watched Grid's duel against Damian at the Vatican through OGC's broadcast. While media and public marveled at how easily Grid overwhelmed the paladin, Yura understood that Grid had held back considerably.\n\n*He's been doing this since the third National Competition.*\n\nGrid never revealed his full power against players—not even when facing Kraugel. Because of this, Yura suspected Grid's true capabilities exceeded even her estimates. Combined with Euphemina's conditional supremacy, they could surely overcome the clone.\n\nHowever, a problem emerged.\n\n—Is Euphemina responding to you?\n\n—...?\n\n***\n\n[A whisper has arrived, but you cannot hear it.]\n\n\"...\"\n\nEuphemina's Skill Duplication wasn't omnipotent. Beyond the limited usage count and the overload from excessive copying, another practical issue plagued her: unexpected penalties. Her duplication could replicate skills at one hundred percent effectiveness, but penalties might manifest unpredictably.\n\nThe Master Level Stealth she currently employed carried a \"concentration\" penalty. Maintaining the ability required absolute focus, which forbade high-speed movement, skill casting, and conversation—all activities that would shatter her concentration. The restriction seemed absurdly harsh considering actual assassins who mastered Stealth could move at high speeds, cast skills, and converse freely while remaining invisible.\n\n\"...\" Still, Euphemina remained calm.\n\nYears as a Duplicator had familiarized her with spontaneous penalties. She accepted the concentration requirement naturally, acknowledging she wasn't a true assassin.\n\n[A whisper has arrived, but you cannot hear it.]\n\nShe ignored the cascading notifications, curiosity about the sender buried beneath focus on the scene unfolding before her.\n\n\"Kik... kikik...\"\n\nThe third one now. For reasons unclear, Agnus had been systematically visiting accessory makers' workshops across multiple countries. Yet each time he arrived, the craftsman was already dead, and guards immediately blamed him for the murder.\n\n\"H-hik...!\" The final surviving guard dropped his spear, hands trembling.\n\nAgnus showed no mercy. His blade pierced the young man's heart.\n\n\"...Kik.\"\n\nDeep in the shadowed alley, Agnus finally stopped after shaking off all pursuit.\n\n\"...Lu... na. Luna...\"\n\nStagger. Stagger.\n\nHis body, mind, and spirit matched his hollow eyes—utterly exhausted. His mouth mechanically repeated one name. No, Euphemina recognized it was a nickname.\n\n*Luna is Caroline.*\n\nThough Euphemina existed as an unofficial ranker absent from leaderboards, her information network and resourcefulness had kept her at the pinnacle since Satisfy's launch. She couldn't possibly lack information about Agnus—the target she needed to defeat for her class change quest. \n\nWhich made her heartache all the worse.\n\n*Why?*\n\nWhy did this man drag his lover, already dead in reality, into the game as an undead puppet? Terrible sadness washed over her as she watched Agnus, felt cold witnessing the madness that papered over his grief. He appeared as a massive beast baring fangs, yet in truth, he was pitifully small before reality's weight.\n\n\"Lu... na.\"\n\nThud! The journey had offered no respite. Agnus had battled countless enemies while drowning in despair, pushed far beyond his limits. Like a sand castle built only to collapse, he crumbled. He hit the ground and couldn't rise.\n\nA blonde girl emerged from the darkness—Euphemina, unable to remain a spectator any longer.\n\n\"You?\" His face pressed against cold stone, eyes trembling as he watched her approach. She ached seeing the wounded beast so frightened.\n\nEuphemina's expression twisted bittersweet as she extended a delicate hand toward him. \"Do you want to craft that stone?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Promise you'll release Mumud. Then I'll help you.\"\n\n\"...Why?\"\n\nIn a world containing only frustration and despair, salvation appeared as a blurred fantasy before Agnus' failing vision. Euphemina's heart plummeted witnessing his tears, struggling to maintain composure.\n\n\"No reason. I just think it'll be convenient.\""
