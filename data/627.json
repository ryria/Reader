  "content": "# Chapter: The Weight of Dignity\n\nEarl Bruno froze mid-stride as he entered his living room.\n\nThere—leaning casually against the railing at the center of the hall—stood the Overgeared King.\n\n*No sense of dignity whatsoever.*\n\nBruno's ideal monarch had never been defined by competence. A true king, in his estimation, should possess an air of unassailable nobility, even if they lacked practical ability. Bearing was everything. Authority was inherited, not earned.\n\n*No matter his accomplishments, how can I possibly look up to someone who carries himself like a common laborer?*\n\nThe earl had convinced himself long ago that Grid's humble origins would forever cling to him like cheap cologne. Birth mattered. Bloodlines mattered.\n\n*A king should descend from—*\n\n\"Earl Bruno?\"\n\nGrid's question cut through his thoughts. The king remained where he was, slouched against the stairs, yet Bruno's pulse quickened.\n\n*Those eyes...*\n\nWas that predatory gaze intentional? Had Grid somehow uncovered his role as head of the Anti Grid Alliance? Bruno couldn't be certain. The man was notoriously difficult to read. A chill crept down his spine despite himself.\n\n*The tactical brilliance that allowed him to position himself for the throne before the golem invasion years ago... The raw power to stand against a hundred thousand soldiers... His gift for swaying crowds... The audacity to face down fifteen territorial representatives without flinching...*\n\nBut such a catalog of virtues was unnecessary. Grid could be summarized in far simpler terms: the hero who had annihilated a Great Demon. Yes—Grid had transcended the boundaries of mere mortality, surpassing even the legends of old.\n\nBruno acknowledged all of this. He had no choice.\n\nAnd yet.\n\n*Capability alone doesn't make a king. A monarch must embody elegance, not merely wield power. The throne demands a symbol, not a soldier. Grid should serve as a minister—a blade to be wielded, not the hand that wields it.*\n\nHis noble blood would never permit him to kneel before such a man.\n\nBruno's fists clenched, but when he spoke, his tone remained measured and courteous. To descend to rudeness would be to compromise his own dignity, and he refused to stoop to common behavior.\n\n\"Forgive me for receiving Your Majesty in such... modest accommodations.\"\n\n\"Modest?\" Grid's lips curved into a smile. \"This place rivals the royal palace itself.\"\n\n*The palace...*\n\nGoosebumps rippled across Bruno's arms. The words were pleasant enough on the surface, but he could sense the thorns beneath.\n\n*Remarkable. He knows. Of course he knows.*\n\nGrid must have received intelligence about the thousands of troops concealed within the estate. The comparison to a palace wasn't idle flattery—it was a pointed reference. What ordinary residence could justify housing a private army?\n\n*He's aware I lead the Alliance. But how? Even Duke Steim, who I've served beside for years, suspected nothing.*\n\nSuch an intelligence network would put the Saharan Emperor himself to shame.\n\n\"Kukuk...\"\n\nLaughter escaped Bruno's throat before he could suppress it. He met Grid's gaze directly.\n\n\"May I ask how you discovered the truth?\"\n\nThe question was tactical—an attempt to identify his mistake. But Grid interpreted it differently.\n\n*So Bruno does know about Fatima. He's wondering how I traced it back to him.*\n\n\"I received reports that Fatima was last seen in the vicinity of your estate,\" Grid said simply.\n\n\"...!!\"\n\nBruno's eyes widened. The words struck him like a physical blow.\n\n*From a single witness account, he deduced not only that I'd taken her hostage but that I'm financing a rebellion? That I command the entire Alliance?*\n\nThe man's mind was a steel trap.\n\n*If you had been born to the right family... I would have followed you to the ends of the earth.*\n\nRegret crashed over him like a tsunami. Yet no matter how he tried, Bruno couldn't reconcile himself to Grid's common blood. The knowledge sat in his chest like a stone.\n\nSilence stretched between them.\n\n\"So,\" Grid said at last. \"Where is she?\"\n\nThe question took Bruno by surprise once more.\n\n*He's... concerned for a tailor? A king worrying over a single craftsperson?*\n\nA laugh tried to claw its way up his throat. *Madness. The more I learn, the clearer it becomes. This man would make his people truly happy.*\n\nUnderstanding crystallized in Bruno's mind. The Overgeared Kingdom under Grid's rule would shine more brilliantly than Eternal ever had. But for the old nobility? It would be a nightmare. A commoner king proving himself superior to every blue-blooded monarch who came before—it shattered every assumption Bruno had built his life upon.\n\nHis teeth ground together as he forced out the words.\n\n\"Fatima is underground.\"\n\n\"Underground...\" Grid tilted his head. \"Is there a workshop down there?\"\n\n\"Huhut. I'll tell you exactly what I had planned.\"\n\n\"Oh? Well, I apologize in advance, then.\"\n\nGrid seemed to think he was interrupting some underwear commission Bruno had placed with the tailor.\n\n\"But don't worry—this won't take long. I'll be finished quickly.\"\n\nGrid's confidence stemmed from his legendary craftsmanship. With his exceptional dexterity, he expected to master the underwear production techniques with minimal difficulty. \n\nBruno frowned. \"You'll finish... in an instant?\"\n\n*Does he mean to say he'll kill me, my knights, and three thousand soldiers in the span of moments?*\n\n*Arrogant... but not without cause.*\n\nGrid had faced down a hundred thousand troops. He'd destroyed a Great Demon. Common sense dictated that Bruno and his forces wouldn't even slow him down.\n\nAnd yet.\n\n*Battle is never certain. Variables exist.*\n\nPerhaps, when steel finally met steel, there would be an opening. A chance. That was the nature of combat—the unpredictability of life itself.\n\n*Clink.*\n\nBruno's hand moved to his sheath.\n\n*Step.*\n\nGrid descended the stairs. The presence that radiated from him pressed down on Bruno like a physical weight. But the earl refused to buckle.\n\n\"I carry the blood of a line that stretches back centuries,\" Bruno said, his voice low and fierce. \"Only a true monarch can make me—\"\n\nHis hand tightened on the hilt—\n\n*Wait. To win Fatima's favor quickly, I should maximize my charm and dignity as much as possible.*\n\nThe thought struck Grid suddenly. He opened his inventory and equipped two items: the Holy Light Crown and the Great Lord's Sword.\n\n\"Heok!\"\n\nThe word burst from Bruno's throat. His hand fell away from his weapon as if burned.\n\n*W-What...?*\n\nBruno was no ordinary NPC. His noble blood had been coded with specific parameters—only a character with at least 2,000 dignity points could trigger his recognition response. Grid's naturally high dignity had never quite reached that threshold.\n\nUntil now.\n\nWith the crown and sword equipped, Grid's dignity stat skyrocketed past the critical value.\n\n*A king born not of blood... but of will...*\n\n*Flop.*\n\nBruno's knees hit the floor. His mind went blank, overwhelmed by the sheer weight of authority emanating from the figure before him. In that instant, every conviction he'd held about Grid—every justification for the Alliance—crumbled to dust.\n\n\"Dare... I wouldn't dare stain Your Majesty's hands with my blood.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nGrid noticed belatedly that the earl had drawn his blade and was now kneeling. Then Bruno spoke words that made no sense whatsoever.\n\n\"My knights and soldiers... they never harbored hatred toward Your Majesty. They simply obeyed my irrational commands, as vassals must. I know I have no right to beg mercy, but I trust in your judgment. I'm leaving you a list of all Alliance members. Please—spare my men. Care for them as your own.\"\n\n\"???\"\n\n*What is he talking about?*\n\nQuestion marks might as well have been floating above Grid's head, but Bruno seemed to mistake his confusion for magnanimous silence.\n\n\"Your silence grants clemency. Your Majesty—may you reign eternal!\"\n\n\"Wait, what are you—\"\n\n*Puok!*\n\nThe blade pierced Bruno's own heart before Grid could finish his sentence.\n\n[You have eliminated Earl Bruno, head of the Anti Grid Alliance!]\n\n[List of Anti Grid Alliance members obtained.]\n\n[Old-fashioned Noble's Ring acquired.]\n\n[Old-fashioned Noble's Whip acquired.]\n\n[1,390 of 3,017 soldiers have pledged their loyalty following Earl Bruno's death.]\n\n[28 of 30 knights have pledged their loyalty following Earl Bruno's death. They are in awe of your ability to defeat their master without spilling a single drop of blood.]\n\n[Duke Steim is approaching rapidly!]\n\n\"Your Majesty!\"\n\nThe duke's voice echoed through the halls before the man himself appeared, breathless.\n\n\"I am disgraced! To think an enemy nested among my own subordinates all this time! This is the price of my arrogance!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid felt a profound exhaustion settle into his bones. The situation had spiraled so far beyond his understanding that his cognitive abilities had simply given up trying to parse it.\n\n\"First...\" He rubbed his temples. \"Let's just find Fatima...\"\n\nPerhaps learning underwear production techniques would help clear his head.\n\n---\n\n### S.A. Group Headquarters\n\n\"What do you make of it?\"\n\nLim Cheolho's laughter filled the observation room as monitors displayed Grid's accidental dismantling of the Anti Grid Alliance. Yoon Nahee pulled up several data streams before responding.\n\n\"The variable was Grid maximizing his affinity with Sage Sticks. Originally, if Grid had visited the Frontier after reaching a certain blacksmithing threshold, he would have 'naturally' encountered the Fatima quest. Sticks accelerated the timeline, causing it to overlap with the kingdom's founding episode.\"\n\n\"Precisely. Without maximizing that affinity, Grid wouldn't have been at the Frontier at this specific moment. Furthermore, without Grid claiming the throne, the Anti Grid Alliance would never have formed in the first place.\"\n\n\"Correct. The convergence of the Fatima quest, the Alliance conspiracy, and Earl Bruno—all at once—required every single one of Grid's preceding actions. Remove any one element, and the scenario collapses.\"\n\n\"Which means it wasn't coincidence at all.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Think about the chain of causality. Grid's relationship with Piaro led to his friendship with Kraugel. That friendship led him to the Behen Archipelago, where he encountered Sticks. Every action Grid takes inevitably links to the next. That's not coincidence—that's something far more profound.\"\n\nLim Cheolho leaned back in his chair, a satisfied smile playing at his lips.\n\n\"Peak causality. That's what Grid represents. No wonder Morpheus struggles to predict him.\"\n\n*I need to watch this one closely.*\n\nThree monitors cycled continuously through the chairman's field of view: Grid, Kraugel, and Agnus. Among the five Miracle Players, these three were proving exceptionally fascinating. But lately, the supercomputer Morpheus had been devoting unusual processing power to Agnus.\n\nSomething was building. Lim Cheolho could feel it."
