Every third step, he froze and scanned the parking lot. When headlights swept across the pavement, he dove behind a telephone pole and held his breath.\n\nThe trash bags rustled in his grip. His heart hammered against his ribs.\n\n*Thank God I went through basic training.*\n\nActive duty had been hell at the time, crawling through mud under barbed wire, but the skills stuck. He low-crawled the final ten meters to the bins, dumped the bags, and scrambled back to the apartment entrance.\n\nInside, Youngwoo sagged against the door. \"It was good that I served.\"\n\nThe army had been a sacred duty. Not a waste. He'd hated every minute back then, but now? Pride swelled in his chest.\n\nHis mother looked up from the garlic pile spread across the living room floor. Her knife paused mid-peel. \"Why are you wearing a mask and sunglasses at night?\"\n\n\"False accusations.\" Youngwoo waved a hand. \"I have to protect myself. Can you have Sehee take out the trash for a while?\"\n\n\"Are you insane?\" She set down the knife. \"What false accusation?\"\n\nThe concern in her eyes made his stomach twist. Youngwoo dropped onto the floor beside her and grabbed a garlic bulb. \"Just joking. Let me help.\"\n\n*Pak! Pa pa pa pat!*\n\nWhite cloves flew from his fingers. Skin peeled away in perfect strips, the papery shells falling into a neat pile. His hands moved with mechanical precision, each motion fluid and exact.\n\nHis mother's jaw dropped. \"How are you...?\"\n\n*My son has a talent!*\n\nShe'd spent thirty years peeling garlic, but Youngwoo's speed made her look like a beginner. Her chest tightened. All these years, she'd worried about her son. He'd struggled in school, shown no particular gifts, nothing that made him special. The guilt had eaten at her, the fear that she'd failed him somehow.\n\nBut this. *This.*\n\nTears pricked her eyes as the garlic pile grew. Youngwoo kept his head down, fingers working, oblivious to the emotion radiating from the woman beside him.\n\n***\n\nGrid materialized in Reidan after dinner.\n\nHis boots hit the castle floor, and he immediately turned toward Irene's chambers. Fifty days until the birth. The thought drove him forward like a clockwork mechanism, faithfully ticking through his nightly ritual.\n\nIrene smiled when he entered. \"Dear husband, have a good day today.\"\n\nShe pressed her lips to his cheek. The softness, the warmth, it sent electricity down his spine. Better than any legendary item drop.\n\n*Ttiring~*\n\n> [The child in the belly has felt the true love of the couple, increasing all stats by 1.]\n\nGrid's pulse quickened. *Ten days since the last one.* The stat increases came in patterns now, predictable cycles that he'd started tracking.\n\n*Good start.*\n\nHe kissed Irene's forehead and headed for the smithy.\n\n\"We greet the great sun of Reidan, Duke Grid!\"\n\nThe young blacksmiths snapped to attention. Khan grinned from his workstation, hammer in hand.\n\nGrid acknowledged them with a nod and closed his eyes. *Concentrate.* The structure of a human hand floated in his mind, every bone, joint, and tendon mapped after three hours of study.\n\n\"Item Creation.\"\n\n> [What item do you want to create?]\n\n*Will it work?* The skill had limits. Accessories were impossible. Certain weapon types refused to materialize. He could only create what fell within a blacksmith's domain.\n\nGrid's throat clicked as he swallowed. \"Hands. I want to create hands.\"\n\n> [...]\n\nSilence. The system notification hung in the air, blank and unresponsive.\n\n*Is it impossible?* Disappointment began to curdle in his gut, but then...\n\n> [It is hands, not gauntlets?]\n\nThe question felt different. More organic, more alive than the usual sterile system prompts.\n\n*Something's happening.*\n\nGrid straightened. \"That's right! I want to create hands! Hands based on mine!\"\n\n> [It is possible if you set the material as pavranium.]\n\nHis blood sang. Grid punched the air. \"I will set the material as pavranium!\"\n\n*Ttiring~*\n\nThe cheerful chime echoed through the smithy. Then the notifications cascaded.\n\n> [You have had the same idea as the legendary blacksmith Pagma.]\n>\n> [The third class quest 'What Pagma couldn't Achieve' has been created.]\n\n---\n\n**[What Pagma couldn't Achieve]**\n\n**Difficulty:** Class Quest\n\n300 years ago, the legendary blacksmith created the strongest mineral called pavranium.\n\nPavranium is a mineral with transcendent performance, even above the god mineral adamantium. It would never have been completed without the knowledge of Great Magician Braham.\n\nPagma was inspired. It was his desire to make something that transcended the gods using pavranium. But the quantity was limited, so Pagma had to consider how to use it.\n\nHe conceived the God Hand.\n\nGolden hands that could demonstrate dexterity equivalent to a legendary blacksmith. With the God Hands, Pagma believed he could produce items beyond his current reach.\n\nHowever, he was unable to complete them. Human life was finite, and Pagma was already old.\n\nNow you have reached the same idea. Create and produce the God Hands. Transcend the foundation set by Pagma by achieving what he could not.\n\n**Quest Clear Conditions:** Fully produce hands made of pavranium.\n\n**Quest Clear Reward:** One of the hidden pieces of Pagma's Descendant, 'Sealed Abilities,' will open.\n\n---\n\n*It's as Braham said.*\n\nThe timeline made sense now. Pagma existed 300 years ago, dying even then. Yet somehow, he appeared in history 100 years later. Grid's mind spun through possibilities. *Ghost? No. I'll find out during the story quests.*\n\nHe shook his head and refocused. The challenge ahead demanded everything.\n\n*I'll do it.*\n\nConfidence burned in his chest. Three hours memorizing hand anatomy. The structure was etched into his brain.\n\n> [Please design the God Hand.]\n\nA blank blueprint materialized. Grid's hand moved across the interface, sketching joints, metacarpals, the delicate machinery of fingers. The Item Creation skill compensated, refining his crude drawings into elegant schematics.\n\n> ['Design: God Hand' has been acquired!]\n\n*God Hand.* Even the name radiated power. Grid grinned and pulled pavranium from his inventory.\n\nThe mineral gleamed gold in the furnace light. He positioned it on the anvil and raised the Legendary Blacksmith's Hammer.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nSilence descended. The young blacksmiths stopped moving. Khan set down his tools. The only sound was metal on metal, a rhythmic heartbeat filling the space.\n\nGrid's world narrowed. Pavranium. Anvil. Hammer. Nothing else existed.\n\n*Ttaang—ttang—!*\n\nThe hammer became an extension of his arm. His arm became the hammer. Body and tool merged, moving as a single organism. Each strike fell with perfect precision, shaping the gold.\n\n*Ttaaang!*\n\nThe pavranium flowed like liquid, reforming into complex structures. Joints materialized. Fingers took shape. The intricate mechanics of a human hand emerged from formless metal.\n\nKhan leaned forward, breath held. The young blacksmiths' eyes went wide.\n\n> [Your extreme concentration has activated the Legendary Blacksmith's Breath.]\n>\n> [The Legendary Blacksmith's Breath has increased the effectiveness of your production items.]\n\nGrid blinked. Reality crashed back. He lowered the hammer and stared at the anvil.\n\nGolden hands gleamed in the firelight.\n\n***\n\n*There is no possibility I will lose today.*\n\nPiaro drove his hands into the soil, uprooting vegetables with mechanical efficiency. Grid's level exceeded expectations, but levels weren't everything.\n\n*I'm sorry, My Lord.*\n\nGrid grew quickly. Impressively so. But growth took time. Grid hadn't reached the threshold of legend yet.\n\n*There is still a sky between us.*\n\nSkills couldn't transcend that gap overnight. Yesterday's spar replayed in Piaro's mind. The outcome was predictable. He could win today without sustaining injuries.\n\n*Puk! Puk puk puk puk!*\n\n*Pa pa pa pat!*\n\nVegetables flew from the earth. Piaro's hands moved without pause, a blur of motion that cleared entire rows in seconds.\n\nChris watched from the edge of the field, eyes wide. The Five Captains stood beside him, equally stunned.\n\n*I want a farmer like that.*\n\nPedro lay in ruins, trampled by the golem army. The fields were devastated, food production at zero. But with someone like Piaro? Harvests would improve every quarter. Revenue would soar. The population would rally, reconstruction would accelerate exponentially.\n\nChris sighed. Envy tasted bitter. Grid had collected named NPCs like rare drops, and Piaro was the crown jewel.\n\nPiaro stood and dusted off his hands. \"I should end it here today.\"\n\nThree hours early. Unprecedented.\n\nChris approached. \"Are you going already? What about the sparring?\"\n\n\"I have something important today.\" Piaro brushed dirt from his clothes. \"After finishing the field work, we will spar at night. Later.\"\n\nHe walked away, soil still clinging to his boots.\n\n\"It must be huge if that old man left early.\" One of the captains frowned. \"He's obsessed with farming.\"\n\n\"Maybe something happened with Overgeared?\"\n\nThe speculation made sense. Piaro rarely abandoned his fields. What crisis could pull him away?\n\n\"Follow him.\"\n\nChris gestured. They trailed Piaro through Reidan's sparse streets, maintaining distance. Piaro's insight was supernatural, but the low population made tracking simple enough.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Grid?\"\n\nPiaro stopped outside a large smithy. Grid emerged from the entrance, armed with two greatswords. His expression was grim, focused, the look of a man preparing for war.\n\n*Is there a feud?*\n\nChris's mind raced. If Piaro and Grid had fallen out, this was his chance. Recruitment opportunity.\n\n\"This idiot doesn't understand who he's facing.\"\n\nThe other captains scoffed. Grid couldn't beat Piaro. They'd all fallen to his hand plow. Ten seconds, maximum, before Grid hit the dirt.\n\n*We were beaten. He'll be destroyed.*\n\nThe Five Captains had reached third advancement. They knew Grid's capabilities. The outcome was obvious.\n\nThen the spar began.\n\n\"What...\"\n\nChris's mouth fell open. The Five Captains stood frozen, disbelief etched across their faces.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms**\n\nOG: Glossary Link\n\nCurrent schedule: 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
