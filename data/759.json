  "content": "# Chapter: The Legendary Blacksmith's Luck\n\n*A legendary item? In this timeframe?*\n\nPanmir's mind raced through the calculations. Less than point-zero-one percent—those were Grid's odds, and the evidence supported it. Grid had possessed Pagma's Descendant for at least three or four years. A decade in Satisfy's accelerated time. Plenty of opportunity to forge legendary equipment, yet how many pieces had he actually produced? Ten at most?\n\n*The blue greatsword. That black blade. The scale armor.*\n\nThe same gear, year after year. For all his reputation as the Overgeared King, Grid was practically starving for proper equipment. No, this event would be no different than any other blacksmithing competition. Panmir's confidence solidified. Grid's chances of producing a legendary item here were essentially zero—the same miserable odds Panmir himself faced.\n\nThen reality struck him across the face.\n\n**[(Seeing the Gods' Techniques) Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship Skill Lv. 8]**\n\nThe skill itself had evolved. Where the old Grid had merely a *very rare* chance at legendary items, this Grid operated on a *slim* chance. And that wasn't the end of it. The Legendary Blacksmith's Hammer—Grid's own design—pushed the odds up by a staggering one percent. One in every hundred items. Theoretically.\n\nSo why the shortage? \n\nPure, unadulterated bad luck.\n\nYoon Nahee, head of S.A. Group's operations team, still kept those emails. Dozens of them, sent years ago, each one progressively more unhinged than the last.\n\n*[I'm a legendary blacksmith. I followed the recipe exactly—why am I producing normal-rated garbage? Is this a bug??]*\n\n*[Operators?? I sent you an email. Hours of work for a normal or rare item?? And the rare ones barely show up.]*\n\n*[Hey, you XXX people! Hundreds of items and not one epic! What kind of XXX joke is this? Why call me a legend when I can't make legendary items?! Bug or manipulation—which is it?? Answer me!!]*\n\n*[XX! Scammers! Do I have to show up at headquarters in person?? Will THAT stop the manipulation??]*\n\nThe management team hadn't sanctioned him. How could they? The man was too pitiful. They'd even checked for bugs in the system, convinced something had to be wrong. But no—Grid's luck stat was simply that abysmal. The entire operations team had felt genuine sympathy.\n\n*I never could have imagined.* A smile played across Yoon Nahee's lips as she confirmed the blacksmithing event results. *That this player would rise so high.*\n\nAll that accumulated misfortune, converted into explosive success at critical moments. It worked only because Grid never quit. Never gave up, despite every reason to do so.\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Yoon Nahee murmured to her monitor, raising her coffee cup in salute. \"Keep making miracles.\"\n\n***\n\n*Luck is a skill too. My defeat was inevitable.*\n\nPanmir tried to rationalize it. His opponent was a legend—by definition, their fortune would be overwhelming. Two consecutive years of losses. He attempted to swallow the bitter pill.\n\nBut the truth kept rising back up his throat like bile.\n\nThe tailor event. The jewelry event. First-ranked crafters in both fields had claimed gold. Meanwhile, the world's best blacksmith had never won. Not once.\n\n*Effort means nothing.*\n\nWhy did heaven birth both Panmir and Grid in the same generation? He was drowning in that question when Failure's specifications flashed across the public screens.\n\n\"Holy hell, look at those numbers!\"\n\n\"That's a crafted item? The stats blow away most drops!\"\n\n\"Wait—Grid designed this himself?\"\n\n\"The name is literally *Failure*...\"\n\n\"If that's what he calls a failure, what does his success look like?\"\n\nBy Grid's current standards, Failure ranked only as a second-tier weapon. Inferior to the Red Phoenix Bow, outclassed by the Enlightenment Sword. Yet the crowd saw a masterwork. Within minutes, #Failure was trending across international search engines. Forums exploded with analysis threads.\n\nAmidst the chaos—\n\n\"Panmir.\"\n\nGrid materialized beside him. Concern etched lines around his eyes. Panmir's expression mirrored Khan's when the old blacksmith spoke of his lost son—that look of a man contemplating logging out forever. Grid couldn't allow that. Excellent blacksmiths were the lifeblood of the Overgeared Kingdom.\n\n\"Take a look at this.\"\n\n**[Player Grid wishes to share item information. Accept?]**\n\n\"...?\"\n\nPanmir's confusion was total. Why was Grid handing him—\n\n\"Heok...!\" He accepted the prompt.\n\nHis eyes nearly fell out of his skull.\n\n**[Legendary Blacksmith's Hammer]**\n**Rating: Legendary**\n**Durability: 550/550 | Attack Power: 130~150**\n\n**Rare Item Crafting: +30%**\n**Epic Item Crafting: +20%**\n**Unique Item Crafting: +8%**\n**Legendary Item Crafting: +1%**\n\n***Production skill experience gain increased***\n\n**Conditions of Use: Pagma's Descendant**\n\n\"U-Unbelievable!!!\"\n\nThirteen years. Thirteen years Panmir had slaved as a blacksmith in Satisfy. Countless forgings, endless quest chains, all to scrape together a point-zero-one percent chance at legendary items. This hammer—this single piece of equipment—granted a full one percent increase.\n\nItems were everything. All his effort, meaningless before their power.\n\nPanmir's legs went weak. He stumbled.\n\n\"I'd be happy to forge you one.\"\n\nGrid caught him by the waist, steadying him.\n\n\"On the condition that you relocate to the Overgeared Kingdom. Panmir, I want you. Join the Overgeared Guild.\"\n\n\"...B-But.\"\n\nThe temptation clawed at him. His motivation, which had guttered moments ago, roared back to life. Yet—the dwarf kingdom had taught him ego item creation. The emperor himself had recognized Panmir's skill, elevating him to chief imperial blacksmith. Wealth, influence, the protection of the continent's dominant power—could he truly abandon all of it?\n\nGrid cut through his hesitation like a hot blade through wax.\n\n\"Is there anything more important than items? The empire can't give you what I can.\"\n\n\"Ah...!\"\n\nThe fog cleared. \n\n*Life is items.*\n\nTruth crystallized in his mind, and doubt evaporated.\n\n\"Understood...! I'll submit my application to the Overgeared Guild immediately!\"\n\n\"Not the guild—the Overgeared Workfor...\" Grid caught himself. \"Put your application into Overgeared Two. That's where we place production classes.\"\n\n\"Yes...? U-Understood.\"\n\n*Did he almost say 'workforce'?* Panmir blinked but nodded.\n\nMeanwhile—\n\n\"What the...?\"\n\nCountless viewers witnessed a middle-aged man and a younger man, embracing, whispering urgently to one another. The flush spreading across Panmir's cheeks did nothing to dispel the misunderstanding rippling through the audience.\n\n*Something feels off about this.* \n\nGrid suppressed a shudder but dismissed the concern. Regardless, today the Overgeared Kingdom's workfor—*staff*—had gained a tremendous asset. His smile stretched wide. With each National Competition, his empire grew stronger.\n\n***\n\n\"Pathetic.\"\n\nSkull's voice dripped contempt in the US team's waiting room. Not because Panmir had lost—silver medals deserved praise. No, his anger stemmed from the betrayal.\n\n\"The other blacksmiths told me. You're joining the Overgeared Guild?\"\n\n\"That's correct.\"\n\n\"Kuk...! Where's your pride? You're actually going to *serve* under Grid? Didn't you swear you'd never acknowledge someone who obtained a legendary class through pure luck?\"\n\n\"Don't diminish his accomplishments as mere luck.\"\n\n\"You're insane! Items have blinded you!\"\n\nSkull's disappointment cut deeper than any blade. He'd admired Panmir—respected how the man had reached the pinnacle despite his age. That respect made this betrayal burn.\n\n\"Panmir! I...! I wanted you to resist Grid! To prove yourself his better!\"\n\n\"...I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe bitter smile Panmir offered held genuine regret. He knew Skull had looked up to him.\n\n\"I'm not like you!\" Skull jabbed a finger at Panmir's chest. \"I'll reject items and rely on pure skill!\"\n\nHe stormed out.\n\nTwo hours later.\n\n\"...Can I join the Overgeared Guild?\"\n\nSkull limped back, Jishuka's Red Phoenix Bow having educated him thoroughly during the monster obstacle race. His pride lay in tatters somewhere on the arena floor.\n\nHe'd learned the truth about items the hard way."
