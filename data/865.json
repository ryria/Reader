The generous rewards should have excited him, but dread twisted his gut instead.\n\n*How the hell do I break through?*\n\nThe quest demanded escape with Irene and Lord. Not just because some system window told him to—his oath as a knight bound him more than any game mechanic ever could.\n\n*Can't fight Yatan's Servants head-on.* \n\nThe Yatan Church stood as the only organization capable of matching the Rebecca Church continent-wide. Their named NPCs wielded power far beyond what a Third Advancement player could handle, even one at Coke's level.\n\n*Which means Rose or Agnus. One of them has to fall.*\n\nThe realization sat like lead in his stomach. Coke might rank among the new generation's elite, but he'd never claimed first place in anything. Rose and Agnus had honed their respective classes to perfection—talents equal to his own, with levels and equipment that left him in the dust.\n\nTime was the real gap. Agnus and Rose had played since launch day. The quests they'd completed, the bosses they'd slain—all of it translated into power Coke couldn't match. Better gear. Stronger skills. Wider margins for error.\n\n*Still can't just stand here.* \n\nCoke's blade sang free of its sheath. He waited for orders from his superiors, knowing his role in this catastrophe all too well. Supporting actor. The stage belonged to figures too brilliant for him to mistake himself as the lead. Supporting actors followed. They didn't improvise.\n\nChucksley and Royman were already strategizing nearby.\n\n\"Rebecca's Daughters will engage Yatan's Servants.\" Chucksley's voice cut through the chaos. \"We punch through the necromancer blocking the right entrance.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" Royman's hand rested on his sword hilt.\n\nThey'd settled on Agnus as their target.\n\nKasim melted from the shadows, joining their huddle. \"My shadow soldiers report an undead army deployed outside the hall. The paladins and Rebecca's Daughter candidates can't penetrate their ranks.\" His eyes found Agnus across the chamber. \"That necromancer commands them.\"\n\nChucksley nodded. \"If he's controlling that many corpses, he can't spare attention for defense.\"\n\nThe logic was sound. Everyone in that hall—veteran warriors and calculating players alike—had identified Agnus as the weakest link.\n\nOn the grand staircase, Isabel abandoned her assault on Pope Damian's barrier. She pivoted toward Agnus, divine light gathering at her fingertips. \"Goddess' Wrath!\"\n\nHer assessment matched Chucksley's. The weakest enemy. The obvious target.\n\nReality proved less accommodating.\n\n\"Kik!\" Agnus' laugh scraped like rusted nails. \n\nHis sword—corroded and wretched—intercepted Lifael's Spear mid-thrust. The impact rang through the hall. Isabel's eyes widened. Every witness froze in disbelief. A necromancer. Blocking one of Rebecca's Daughters. With a *sword.*\n\n\"He's not just any necromancer!\" Coke's shout merged with a dozen others.\n\n\"Baal's Contractor!\"\n\n\"Baal's... Contractor?\" Isabel's whisper barely carried.\n\nDivine power hemorrhaged from Lifael's Spear where it touched that rusted blade. A curse capable of neutralizing the sacred itself. The realization clicked into place. This wasn't a weakness they could exploit.\n\n\"Dispersed Dream.\"\n\nRose's voice cut through the din. Yatan's Eighth Servant—the top-ranked black magician on the entire continent—unleashed one of her ultimate techniques. Black miasma exploded outward from her position, a wave of corruption that washed over every soul in her sight line.\n\n**[10,000 fixed damage]**\n\n**[Status effects: Confusion, Weakness, Silence]**\n\n\"Kuaaaak!\" Screams erupted like a symphony of agony. Players with low status resistance collapsed to their knees, clutching their heads as reality warped around them.\n\nBut the royalty—Irene, Lord, and their peers—remained untouched. Their knights had moved faster than thought, bodies interposing as shields, blocking Rose's line of sight.\n\n\"It's okay.\" Irene's arms tightened around Lord, her smile brittle as glass. \"We're okay.\"\n\nHer voice shook. Her body trembled. Love and terror warred across her face as she tried to shelter her son from the truth of their situation.\n\n\"Mother...\" Lord felt both her fear and her fierce protection. Purpose crystallized in his young heart. *I have to protect her.*\n\nHe moved.\n\nCoke's heart dropped into his boots as Lord surged from cover. *I thought this kid was supposed to be smart!*\n\nThe rumors painted Lord as a prodigy without equal. Training under Kasim's lethal tutelage. Learning from Legendary Farmer Piaro. Studying magic with High Elf Sticks himself. Genius born of genius, they said. Destined to eclipse even Grid.\n\nBut he was *six years old.*\n\nWhat good were assassination techniques when his muscles hadn't developed? When his stamina couldn't sustain prolonged combat? When his reach fell short of a grown man's guard?\n\n*Emotion over logic. Just a scared kid after all.*\n\nFresh tension coiled through Coke's frame. He'd need to compensate for the boy's reckless charge.\n\nBut Kasim and Chucksley moved before Coke could. They materialized in Lord's path like sentinels, no words exchanged, perfect synchronization born of battlefield instinct. Both pivoted toward Isabel's struggle with Agnus and Rose.\n\nChucksley's blade carved toward Rose, forcing her back from Isabel. In the same heartbeat, Kasim dissolved into Agnus' shadow and erupted behind him, dagger seeking spine.\n\n\"Kuhat! Hat!\" Agnus' cry mixed laughter and pain in equal measure.\n\nThe dagger struck true. Massive damage. Named NPCs above level 400 didn't go down easy—Grid was the only player who made it look simple. But Kasim's strike had shaken Agnus to his core.\n\n\"Royman!\" Chucksley and Kasim called out in unison as they dragged their targets away from the entrance.\n\n\"On it!\"\n\nThe younger knights moved as one. They surrounded Irene and Lord, forming a mobile fortress as they charged the now-clear exit.\n\nRose and Agnus paid them no mind. Their eyes remained fixed on greater prizes—Rebecca's Daughters, Pope Damian, the paladins. The quest rewards for eliminating the Church's hierarchy dwarfed any bounty on fleeing royalty.\n\nBut not all Yatan Servants shared that priority.\n\n\"Don't let *anyone* escape!\" Aliburn—Yatan's Third Servant—thrust his staff skyward. \"We slaughter them all! Let the continent know the Yatan Church's true power!\"\n\nBlack magic uncoiled from Aliburn like living smoke. It latched onto priests and paladins, vampiric in its hunger, draining mental power and mana to fuel his own reserves. The Rebecca Church's faithful collapsed by the dozens, magical circuits burned dry.\n\n\"Ah...! Ahhh...!\" Priests paled as their mana evaporated. Their spells died on their lips, sacred power rendered impotent.\n\nThousands of black magicians surged through the gaps, targeting every royal family member in the hall. Including Irene and Lord.\n\n\"Dark Vocation...\"\n\n\"Going somewhere?\"\n\nThe Overgeared Knights became a whirlwind of steel. Blades rose and fell in crimson arcs, each swing intercepting a warlock aiming for the Queen and Prince.\n\n**[You have defeated a black magician of the Yatan Church.]**\n\n**[2,290,190 experience acquired.]**\n\nThe black magicians matched the players' average level. No exceptional threats individually. Coke cut them down with practiced efficiency, but the sheer numbers threatened to drown them. For every three that fell, five more pushed forward. Chanting filled the air like demonic prayer.\n\nRoyman's guard slipped.\n\nOne black magician completed his incantation.\n\nDark flames, spectral chains, and curse-laden shadows hammered into the knight formation. The barrage found Irene and Lord at its center.\n\n\"Your Majesty! My Prince!\"\n\nNo time to think. Coke lunged, wrapping both of them in his arms as his back absorbed the full assault.\n\nPain white-hot and absolute. His health gauge plummeted past half in a single instant. The curses burrowed into his flesh like parasites, and physical agony merged with mental torment as debuffs stacked.\n\n\"Cough!\" Blood sprayed from his lips.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" Irene's hands fluttered near him, desperate but afraid to touch the wounds.\n\nCoke forced his lips into a smile, swallowing the scream that wanted to tear free. \"I'm fine. As long as you two are safe.\"\n\n\"Sir Coke...\"\n\nBlood streamed down his back and hips, soaking through his armor. Coke turned away before Irene could see the extent of the damage. His blade lashed out, cleaving through two more black magicians to clear their escape route.\n\n\"Let's move. Now.\"\n\n\"Yes...\" Irene didn't hesitate. Every second of delay put these knights in greater danger. \"Thank you.\"\n\nCoke drove forward despite the agony screaming through every nerve. Then familiar voices rang from beyond the entrance, cutting through the chaos.\n\n\"Your Majesty! Prince Lord!\"\n\n\"My Prince, where are you?\"\n\nThe Rebecca's Daughter candidates. Lord's mouth opened to respond to their calls—\n\n\"You're not going anywhere.\"\n\nSilvenas moved like lightning given form. Yatan's Fourth Servant materialized at the entrance, weapon drawn, blocking their escape. Her laugh scraped like broken glass as she leveled her free hand at the doorway and unleashed a torrent of black magic.\n\nThe explosion consumed the Rebecca's Daughter candidates outside. Screams cut short. Smoke billowed.\n\nThrough the haze, Silvenas' eyes locked onto Irene. \"I've been watching you, hidden in the shadows. So beautiful. So eloquent.\" Her smile twisted into something ugly. \"Pretty things disgust me.\"\n\nThe courage Irene had built through sheer willpower shattered. Her body shook as she faced the Yatan Servant, terror overwhelming maternal instinct.\n\n\"Hahhh, that terrified expression...\" Silvenas shuddered in ecstasy. Her cheeks flushed crimson. Grey hair framed a face gone mad with pleasure as she licked her lips with a serpent's tongue. \"Perfect.\"\n\nShe advanced, savoring each step.\n\n\"Your Majesty!\" Coke burst through, cutting down the black magicians at his heels. \n\nToo slow.\n\nSilvenas' blade moved faster than his eyes could track. Red energy carved through his armor like paper. His health bar nearly emptied.\n\n**[You have suffered serious damage!]**\n\n**[Grid Armor Made by a Craftsman durability decreased by 47.]**\n\n**[Health has fallen below 10%.]**\n\n**[Subquest completed. Stamina permanently increased by 20.]**\n\n\"K...uack...! Not... yet...!!\"\n\nCan't die. Won't fail. Coke clawed at the blood-slicked floor, trying to rise. Had to hold until Royman finished with the black magicians. Had to protect them for just a few more seconds.\n\nHis vision swam. Bleeding status effect. The world tilted as consciousness tried to slip away. His face met the gore-drenched marble.\n\nSilvenas crouched before Irene, head tilted like a curious predator. \"Where shall I start tearing? Here?\" She traced a finger along Irene's throat. \"Or here?\"\n\nRose and Agnus kept the heavy hitters occupied. The black magicians had the others pinned. Silvenas had all the time in the world to enjoy these helpless lambs. She'd savor every—\n\nThe lamb bared his fangs.\n\n\"**Storm Sword.**\"\n\nSilvenas' eyes went wide.\n\nA tempest of sword energy swallowed her whole."
