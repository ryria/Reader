  "content": "# Chapter: The God's Enlightenment\n\nThe newsfeeds across every major city told the same story.\n\n\"Still no word from the Overgeared King?\"\n\n\"None. He vanished three days ago during the temple's opening ceremony.\"\n\n\"What's the situation in the Overgeared Kingdom?\"\n\n\"His guild claims he's safe, but the populace isn't convinced. The longer this continues, the more unstable things become—both domestically and abroad.\"\n\nWhile the world fixated on Grid's mysterious disappearance, a different rumor spread through quieter channels. Whispers passed between accessory makers in workshops and trade halls: the Yatan Church was hunting their kind.\n\nMost dismissed it as paranoid fantasy. What business could the Church of Evil have with craftsmen of rings and amulets?\n\nBut Clover, ranked seventh among accessory makers worldwide, couldn't shake his unease. Rumors didn't materialize from nothing. If the Yatan Church truly sought accessory makers, they had a reason—and his master might stand in their path.\n\nHe ran.\n\nBy the time he reached Helen's studio, black knights were already withdrawing into the shadows.\n\n\"Master!\"\n\nHelen's body dissolved into ash before he could reach her.\n\n[The accessory maker Helen has died.]\n\nThe notification was cold. Clinical. It couldn't capture what Helen meant—the years she'd spent guiding him, the patience she'd shown a fumbling apprentice, the quiet pride in her eyes when he'd earned his rank. He'd promised himself he would repay her kindness. He'd been so close.\n\nNow she was ash on the wind.\n\n\"No... *no*.\"\n\nClover's hair bleached white, shock manifesting in his avatar. In reality, you could at least hold the dead in your arms. Satisfy offered no such mercy—only the cruelty of watching someone you loved scatter like morning mist.\n\n\"Why?\" His voice cracked. \"She never did anything to you! She refused the Empire's gold, stayed in this backwater town her whole life, helped anyone who asked—why?\"\n\nHe knew it was pointless to demand logic from fanatics. The Yatan Church embodied chaos and cruelty; reason didn't apply. But he needed to understand. He needed this senseless death to *mean* something.\n\n\"She devoted everything to her craft and her students. Not for money. Not for fame. For *people*.\" Tears carved tracks down his face. \"She didn't deserve this.\"\n\nThe black knights regarded him dispassionately. As an accessory maker, Clover had no combat capability worth mentioning. He couldn't avenge Helen. Dying here would cost him levels and equipment—setbacks that might take months to recover from.\n\nNone of that mattered.\n\nHe stepped forward, fists clenched despite their uselessness.\n\n*I'll give everything. My levels, my gear, my life—I'll dedicate it all to making them pay.*\n\n\"We act to prevent a traitor from finding craftsmen who could work the Stone of Life,\" one of the knights said, his tone almost conversational.\n\nClover blinked. \"The Stone of Life?\"\n\n\"Forged in virgin blood. A cursed thing.\" The knight's helmet reflected Clover's pale face. \"The traitor who created it seeks an accessory maker to complete his work. We cannot allow that.\"\n\nThe explanation didn't soothe his rage—it split it, divided it between the Church and this unknown monster.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Agnus. Remember the name. He killed your master as surely as if he'd wielded the blade himself.\"\n\n[New Quest: Master's Enemy]\n\n[Hunt Baal's Contractor, Agnus—common enemy of the world.]\n\nClover's avatar shook. He knew that name. Everyone knew that name.\n\nAnd now he had a target for his vengeance.\n\n***\n\nIn Juden, capital of the Murray Kingdom, death visited another workshop.\n\n\"Weak.\" Agnus stood amid the carnage, Catherine's blood still wet on his hands. \"They're all so *weak*.\"\n\nGuards burst through the door, spears leveled.\n\n\"Freeze! You're under arrest for murder!\"\n\nAgnus tilted his head. \"Again? Do I hear this speech everywhere I go?\"\n\nThe Yatan Church's reach exceeded his estimates. Their agents were already framing him, turning every accessory maker's death into another bounty on his head. The noose tightened with each city.\n\nA prickle ran down his spine.\n\nSomeone was watching.\n\nIn the shadows of a nearby rooftop, golden hair tied in a practical ponytail, Euphemina observed through master-level Stealth. Even Agnus—paranoid, hyper-aware Agnus—couldn't detect Faker's signature technique.\n\nShe memorized his equipment, his movement patterns, the way he favored his right side.\n\nGrid had called her stronger than himself. She wouldn't let him down.\n\n***\n\n[The Blue Dragon's Breath has been strengthened!]\n\n[Strengthened Blue Dragon's Breath]  \n*Forged by the legendary blacksmith Grid, who transcends mortality to touch myth itself.*  \n- Grants 50% lightning resistance even when stored in inventory  \n- Can infuse items with the Blue Dragon's aura  \n- Only compatible with items bearing strong lightning attributes  \nWeight: 2\n\n\"Yes!\" Grid's grin could have lit the forge without flames.\n\n*Remarkable*, Hexetia thought, observing the mortal work. Grid's ability to enhance divine beast materials bordered on godhood itself. But more impressive than his skill was his *patience*.\n\nFor two days straight, Grid had hammered the Blue Dragon's Breath. Each strike released arcs of lightning that would have killed a normal man. Grid's health bar flickered red repeatedly, only to be restored by potions and sheer stubbornness. He endured. He persevered. He *learned*.\n\nHexetia, who had always relied on perfect technique born of divinity, couldn't fathom such determination.\n\n*Even with my blessing, he shouldn't have succeeded. He pushed past the limits of technique itself.*\n\nThree humans had reached the threshold where gods stood: Bultar, Pagma, and Grid.\n\nAnd Hexetia had been jealous of them all.\n\n*I was a child. A petulant child who saw their achievements as heaven's mistakes rather than earned triumphs.*\n\nShame burned hotter than any forge.\n\n*Bultar and Pagma are gone. But Grid remains.*\n\nHexetia's gaze softened.\n\n*Then you will receive the respect I failed to give them.*\n\nThe Sword of Light completed its final strike against the mithril. Two days of constant refinement crystallized in that last, perfect blow.\n\n[White Light Mithril]  \n*Forged through Grid's growing legend and an advanced light elemental's power, using the Magic Battle Gear Production Method.*  \n- Three times harder than standard mithril  \n- Magical compatibility increased tenfold  \n- Imbued with the power of light  \nConditions of Use: Grid\n\nGrid lifted the shimmering metal, examining how light played across its surface. \"I held the First Holy Sword recently. Your masterpiece.\"\n\nHexetia waited.\n\n\"The blade's surface—divine stone. The core—adamantium.\" Grid tossed the mithril into the furnace. \"At first, I couldn't understand the design. Divine stone outclasses adamantium in every metric. Why use both?\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"I disassembled it. Rebuilt it. Made copies. Studied every seam and edge.\" Grid's eyes reflected furnace-fire. \"Divine stone is superior, but it's rigid—it reflects the creator's will without flexibility. Iron is strong but can't contain divine power. So you used adamantium as a channel, a focus for that power.\"\n\n\"You see clearly.\"\n\n\"Both materials are so strong that joining them is nearly impossible. You sublimated them through a separate smelting process, forcing union without compromise.\"\n\nHexetia nodded. \"The result combines overwhelming physical force with divine authority. Divine stone cuts through even a Great Demon's flesh and bone. Adamantium conducts the user's divine power to destroy their very soul.\"\n\n\"But it's not perfect.\"\n\nThe god stiffened.\n\nGrid continued, \"The materials maximized their individual properties, but no *synthesis* occurred. They coexist rather than fuse. No new attributes emerged from their union.\"\n\nHe was right. Hexetia had created a masterwork, but not a *revelation*.\n\n\"I faced the same problem with pavranium and Blue Dragon's Breath. Their individuality was too strong—they refused to merge.\" Grid added the Strengthened Blue Dragon's Breath and pavranium to the furnace containing White Light Mithril. \"Then I remembered mithril. It absorbs all magical properties, making it compatible with any attribute...\"\n\nThe materials, which had resisted combination for hours, suddenly began to flow together. The mithril acted as a bridge, its adaptable nature coaxing the stubborn substances into harmony.\n\n\"Hexetia, be proud. I learned this from your First Holy Sword.\"\n\nThe hammer fell.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nGrid's movements achieved a rhythm beyond technique—each strike precisely calculated yet flowing like water, neither too hard nor too soft, hitting the exact moment when metal was neither too hot nor too cold. The dance of a master who'd internalized his craft until thought and action became one.\n\nThe red-hot metal cooled, hardened, quenched. When Grid finally set it on the anvil, it gleamed like translucent platinum shot through with azure lightning. Pavranium, Strengthened Blue Dragon's Breath, and White Light Mithril had achieved true fusion—ego intact, imbued with both lightning and light, harder than anything the world had seen.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nThe mass became a blade. Grid fashioned it to attach and detach via the Pulling Device, but eschewed the silver thread. Why use strings to control a blade that could follow mental commands?\n\n\"To think mithril—simple, common mithril—could serve as the keystone...\"\n\nHexetia felt the lesson sink deep. The goddess created nothing in vain. Everything had purpose, had value. He'd forgotten that truth in his divine arrogance.\n\n*I've lost.*\n\nHis own completed sword—far more powerful than Grid's—now felt hollow. Technically superior but conceptually bankrupt. A failure born of pride.\n\nHe tried to hide it behind his back.\n\n\"Why hide it?\" Grid set down his hammer. \"You think I care about winning? I learned everything from watching you work.\"\n\n\"Why do you always say exactly what I need to hear?\"\n\n[Quest Complete: Compete Against the Blacksmith God!]\n\n[Victory: You have surpassed a god in his own domain!]\n\n[Hexetia acknowledges you. His jealousy has burned away, replaced by enlightenment learned from a mortal. He no longer doubts your intentions regarding his temple.]\n\n[The Stone of Original Sin's corruption is fading from the Vatican's First Holy Sword. Visit the Vatican to complete \"Cleanse the First Holy Sword.\"]\n\n[Affinity with Hexetia has reached 70!]\n\nHexetia's voice resonated across every continent, through every city and village, into the ears of gods and mortals alike.\n\n**\"The blacksmith Grid has granted me new understanding. He is my benefactor. In gratitude, I bless humanity.\"**\n\n[The blacksmith god blesses all smiths!]\n\n[For 10 days, skill growth for all blacksmith-related abilities increases by 20%!]\n\n[Your fame has transcended mortal bounds.]\n\n[The Great Demons of Hell have learned your name.]\n\n[The dwarves seek you out, eager to test their skills against yours.]\n\n[Someone in Hell knows your location.]\n\n[1st Great Demon Baal is delighted...]"
