  "content": "Chairman Lim Cheolho built the world's first concert hall. Not just any concert hall—the largest venue on Earth, with acoustics so perfect they bordered on supernatural. Seoul became its home.\n\nIn public interviews, Lim dismissed the project as a passion for classical music. Nothing more than an old man's hobby.\n\n\"I don't buy it.\" Two men sat in the S.A. Concert Hall's private box, Mozart's *Magic Flute* echoing through the space below. \"Lim Cheolho's revealing his true ambition.\"\n\nDirector Lee Gookrae glanced at his companion—Kim Jaeshik, the white-haired president of OGC. The older man's eyes remained fixed on the stage.\n\n\"Mozart's been played continuously for three hundred years,\" Kim Jaeshik said. \"Every single day. Somewhere in the world, his music is being performed at this very moment.\"\n\nLee Gookrae nodded. Too many people dismissed classical music as pretentious—the domain of the wealthy, a tool for displaying status. They didn't realize they hummed these melodies without thinking. That Mozart's genius had woven itself into the fabric of human culture.\n\n\"Over a thousand albums. Hundreds of millions of copies sold worldwide.\" Kim Jaeshik leaned back, his fingers steepled. At sixty-three, he'd earned his position atop the gaming industry's most powerful media station through precisely this kind of insight. \"Chairman Lim dreams of the same immortality for Satisfy. He wants players to perform his creation for eternity—an orchestra that never stops playing.\"\n\n\"And Grid is his star soloist,\" Lee Gookrae said quietly.\n\n\"Exactly. Which is why Lim Cheolho can't possibly be happy that Grid's sitting out the National Competition.\" Kim Jaeshik's lips curved into a knowing smile. \"The maestro needs his virtuoso on stage.\"\n\nLee Gookrae drummed his fingers on the armrest. \"You think Chairman Lim will find a way to force Grid's participation? Even if Grid refuses?\"\n\n\"Not force. *Incentivize.*\" Kim Jaeshik's smile widened. \"Grid won't compete as a player—but he'll appear nonetheless. In a different role. And the bait will be far more valuable than any gold medal.\"\n\n\"What role?\"\n\n\"That's what we need to discover. Personally?\" Kim Jaeshik's eyes gleamed. \"I'm betting on Breaking the Hero.\"\n\nLee Gookrae straightened. Breaking the Hero—the event where participants challenged a perfect AI replica of the previous year's PvP champion. A measuring stick. *See how far you've come.*\n\n\"Last year's hero copied Kraugel's stats perfectly,\" Kim Jaeshik continued. \"But the AI couldn't replicate his instincts. His split-second decision-making. It was technically Kraugel, yet... not. The performance fell short.\"\n\n\"But Grid's different.\"\n\n\"Precisely. Grid doesn't rely on godlike reflexes or supernatural game sense. His skill is—relatively speaking—ordinary for his tier.\" Kim Jaeshik chuckled. \"Which makes him *perfect* for AI replication. Most people are salivating to see what Grid would look like with actual talent behind the controls.\"\n\nLee Gookrae felt the hairs on his neck rise. \"What if it's not AI at all? What if Grid himself controls the hero?\"\n\nThey locked eyes.\n\nThe scenario unfolded in Lee Gookrae's mind: Participants eagerly facing the Grid AI, expecting a technical showcase. Instead, the hero moves with Grid's characteristic efficiency—brutal, practical, overwhelming. The audience grows confused. *Why isn't the AI performing better?*\n\nBut no one boos. Because Grid is still *Grid*. Still unstoppable. The challengers fall one after another.\n\nThen, in the silence following the last elimination, the hero speaks:\n\n*\"I'm Grid.\"*\n\nNot an AI. Never was. The real Grid—demonstrating that a year's progress meant nothing. That last year's Grid could *still* dominate today's competition. The audience would lose their collective minds.\n\n\"The story writes itself,\" Lee Gookrae breathed.\n\n\"Indeed. Grid is the ultimate catalyst for viewer engagement. I can't imagine a National Competition without him.\" Kim Jaeshik stood, buttoning his jacket as the opera's first act concluded. \"This year, OGC pivots. We don't focus on the players—we focus on the *challenges* they face. And we find Grid first. Before anyone else.\"\n\nRisky. But the odds were favorable. Lee Gookrae had studied yesterday's updated rankings. Grid's position—steadily declining for months—had suddenly reversed. Sharp upward momentum over the past week.\n\n*He's hunting again. Training his combat skills. Preparing for something big.*\n\nGrid intended to deceive the entire world. A natural-born showman.\n\nDirector Lee Gookrae's heart hammered against his ribs.\n\n***\n\n>[Tiramet's level has risen.]\n\n>[Randy's level has risen.]\n\n>[Noe's level has risen.]\n\n>[Noe's level has risen.]\n\n>[Overgeared Skeleton One's and Overgeared Skeleton Two's levels have risen.]\n\n>[Overgeared Skeleton One's and Overgeared Skeleton Two's levels have risen.]\n\n\"Control? Overrated.\" Grid watched another messenger disintegrate. \"This game's about pets.\"\n\nEvery kill split experience among his summons. Initially, he'd resented the dilution. Now? The investment paid dividends. His hunting speed had *quadrupled*. Galgunos Temple—which four days ago had kept him on a knife's edge—now felt comfortable. Almost homey.\n\nThe intermediate bosses, though. Those still demanded respect.\n\n\"Should I try going deeper?\" Grid eyed the spiral staircase descending into darkness. Galgunos Temple was a three-dimensional maze, pathways intersecting at chaotic angles, staircases appearing seemingly at random. Each stairwell leading downward spawned an intermediate boss nearby. The difficulty spike was *steep*.\n\n\"What horrors are waiting down there?\"\n\nThe Overgeared Skeletons' jaws clattered—their approximation of laughter. Mocking him. *Coward.*\n\nNoe batted their skulls with soft paws. \"The moment you descend, they become enemies, nyang.\"\n\n\"Wait—the skeletons?\"\n\n\"Correct, nyang. Nasty lich smell below. Skeletons cannot resist lich commands. They become slaves, nyang.\" Noe's tail lashed. \"Not Noe! Noe is no slave!\"\n\nGrid grimaced. He'd *known* Galgunos was a lich. Had even anticipated using the Overgeared Skeletons against him eventually. But if they'd just turn on Grid immediately...\n\n\"Same problem with Agnus' lich, then. Can't bring skeletons to that fight either. Damn—\"\n\nGrid jerked backward.\n\nA dagger embedded itself in the stone where he'd stood a heartbeat before.\n\n*Not near any stairs.*\n\nIce flooded Grid's veins. The intermediate bosses' spawn range was *expanding*. He looked up.\n\nA war god follower had clawed free of its grave. Undead, yet moving with inhuman speed—no shuffling corpse, but a predator. The headless rider charging toward him had its head fully attached, actually. Not a dullahan. Something worse.\n\n>[You have suffered 8,940 damage.]\n\nGrid grunted as the rusty blade punched through his armor. Tiramet and Randy scrambled to intercept, pulling the follower back.\n\n\"...battle gear... mountain... where...\" The follower's voice rattled like stones in a grave.\n\n\"Where's *what?* I don't know, you crazy bastard!\" Grid's Enlightenment Sword sang. Red lightning screamed from the heavens.\n\nThe follower convulsed—but didn't retreat. Its rusty blade carved through Tiramet's guard, drawing deep gouges. Randy's **Revolve** barely deflected the follow-up. Grid capitalized on the opening, his control sharper than any ordinary ranker's. Pagma's Swordsmanship flowed through the gaps in the follower's defense.\n\n\"...battle gear... mountain... where...\"\n\nThe follower didn't flinch. Felt no pain. No fear. And each time Grid's blade connected, it struck back—an automatic counterattack dealing identical damage.\n\n*Millions of health. Counterattacks every hit. Who could solo this thing?*\n\nBut Grid wasn't alone. Seven versus one. The Blade Aiming at the Gods absorbed the counterattacks effortlessly. Grid launched into his sword dance.\n\n\"**Flash!**\"\n\nThe light elemental blazed. For exactly 0.3 seconds, the follower was blind—unable to track Grid's movements, its counterattack wasted on empty air.\n\n\"**Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle!**\"\n\n**Blacksmith's Rage** and **Blackening** already active, Grid unleashed his ultimate combination. The follower's blood painted the temple floor as blow after devastating blow tore through its undead form.\n\n>[**God's Command** has activated!]\n\nLady Luck smiled.\n\n\"**Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle!**\"\n\nThe cooldown *reset*. Grid's arms blurred. The follower's scream cut short as ash consumed its body.\n\n>[Your level has risen.]\n\n>[**Spectre's Equipment Fragment** has been acquired.]\n\n>[**Sword Grave's Map Fragment (6)** has been acquired.]\n\nGrid froze. The experience was expected. But that second item...\n\n*Sword Grave.*\n\nWhere Pagma spent his final years. Where Braham's body supposedly rested.\n\n\"Is *this* the mountain of battle gear?\" Grid's hands trembled as he unfolded the map fragment. What tragedy connected Galgunos' followers to this place? Why did war god followers seek it even in death?\n\nHe didn't care about the answers.\n\nOnly one thing mattered.\n\n\"If I complete this map...\"\n\n*Braham.*\n\nThat precious name burned in Grid's mind. His expectations for hidden pieces soared."
