But the Korean government had invited players to South Korea for a different purpose—tourism. They decided to host several events offline, including the opening ceremony.\n\nThe gamble paid off spectacularly. Nearly 800,000 foreign tourists flooded into Korea. The economic windfall exceeded even the government's most optimistic projections.\n\n\"This success has elevated the S.A. Group's standing considerably.\"\n\nCountries around the world were already petitioning to host the next National Competition. The S.A. Group executives watched their share prices climb and raised their glasses in celebration.\n\n\"Win-win doesn't even begin to cover it.\"\n\nThe South Korean government had leveraged the S.A. Group's support to host the Competition. The result? Massive economic growth and overwhelming public approval.\n\nThe S.A. Group's stock surged, demonstrating their influence on a global scale. Under their policy of returning 3.6% of profits to society, their charitable operations could expand—more poor people would benefit from their programs.\n\nRankers received astronomical appearance fees for visiting Korea. Billions of viewers worldwide enjoyed unparalleled entertainment. Everyone won. The laughter echoing through corporate boardrooms was justified.\n\nSatisfy was living up to its name. Lim Cheolho's vision was being realized.\n\n\"This makes it all worthwhile.\"\n\nLim Cheolho stood at the window of his office. The scientist had created a virtual reality world without limits—a space where everyone could find happiness, much like the gods who created reality itself. He had transcended his peers. History would remember his name.\n\n***\n\n**Cheongdamdong District**\n\nPon strode down the street with a spring in his step. \"So many beautiful women. Those slim figures... *chef's kiss*.\"\n\nThe National Competition had delivered everything he could want. High-level PvP against the best players in the world. A massive payday. And now? Access to stunning Korean women. He felt like he was walking on clouds.\n\nHe spotted a group near a boutique and approached with his trademark confidence. \"Hey there, ladies. How about a drink? My treat—I'll buy the expensive stuff if you'll spend some time with me.\"\n\nHis English was clumsy, his pickup line cheesy. It worked anyway. Pon looked just as handsome in reality as he did in Satisfy.\n\nJishuka watched from a nearby cafe terrace, her eyes widening. *Is that really Pon?*\n\nIn both L.T.S and Satisfy, Pon had never shown interest in women. Aside from his childish bickering with Vantner, he was the model of focus—always training, always leveling, always fighting.\n\nThis playboy routine was a complete shock.\n\n\"I've known him for over three years.\" She shook her head. \"I had no idea he was like this.\"\n\nRegas sat beside her, working his way through a parfait. He smiled. \"He's swamped in Satisfy—no time for anything else. But in reality? He can cut loose. Quite a few rankers are experiencing the same phenomenon.\"\n\n\"That's... a logical explanation.\" Jishuka nodded slowly. Then she blinked. \"Wait. What are you wearing?\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I've been wearing this since we arrived.\" Regas glanced down at his taekwondo uniform. \"Jishuka, why aren't you paying attention? We've been together for hours. What's distracting you?\"\n\nJishuka ignored the question. \"Change your clothes. When it's just the three of us, fine. But you're drawing way too much attention.\"\n\n*Buzz buzz buzz.*\n\nCrowds swarmed around the terrace—people desperate for autographs and photos from the two rankers. Fortunately, Satisfy's top players earned enough to justify corporate-level security. Ten bodyguards formed a perimeter, allowing Jishuka and Regas to enjoy their break in peace.\n\nRegas gestured at his uniform. \"If I don't wear taekwondo clothes in the *birthplace* of taekwondo, what should I wear?\"\n\nJishuka stared at him. She gave up. \"...Fine. Do whatever you want. Just eat your parfait.\"\n\n*Men fall into two categories,* she thought. *Childish or wicked.*\n\nHer mind drifted to Grid. *Grid is both childish and wicked.*\n\nHer first impression of him had been terrible. Stupid. Stubborn. Obsessed with big breasts. But at some point, he'd matured. The wickedness faded after his marriage to Irene. He became devoted—single-mindedly so. He didn't even glance at Jishuka's chest anymore.\n\nWitnessing that transformation in real time had changed something. One day, she'd found herself tracking Grid's movements. After he saved her during the Bairan battle, her awareness crystalized into something sharper.\n\nBut she'd only seen Grid in Satisfy. A picture on a screen. She had no idea what he looked like in reality.\n\n*If I meet him and he's like Pon...*\n\nWould she be disappointed? It didn't matter. She'd made her decision.\n\n*I'm in South Korea. I can meet him. Yes. I've decided.*\n\nJishuka stood. The men in the crowd shouted as her voluptuous figure emerged from behind the chair.\n\n\"I'm heading back to the hotel.\"\n\nRegas blinked. \"Now? This is your first time in Korea. Don't you want to sightsee?\"\n\n\"I can visit Korea anytime. Right now, I want to log into Satisfy.\"\n\n\"That's the right attitude.\" Regas jumped to his feet, suddenly motivated. \"Every moment counts. Let's hunt and level during our free time! Neither of us has matches scheduled today anyway.\"\n\n\"You can hunt alone.\" Jishuka started walking. \"I'm logging in to ask Grid for his home address.\"\n\n\"Home address?\" Regas followed, confused. \"You're going to his *house*? Can't you just meet him when your schedules overlap? His ID is on the participant list. Why do you need to visit his home? That's... bad manners.\"\n\n\"Grid didn't even show up to the opening ceremony.\" Jishuka quickened her pace. \"He might not appear at the Competition at all.\"\n\n*She's acting strange,* Regas thought. He shrugged and followed with the bodyguards.\n\n\"Wait up.\"\n\nPon had been about to enter a karaoke bar with five beauties when he spotted Jishuka and Regas leaving.\n\n*Are they going to level?*\n\nRankings could plummet if you got careless. His playtime in Korea would already be limited. Pon's competitive instincts flared. He left the women behind and trailed after his guildmates.\n\n***\n\n**Cork Island**\n\nGrid collapsed onto solid ground, gasping. \"Finally... finally made it.\"\n\nForty-six hours of flight. He'd flown until his mana ran dry, chugged potions, flown again. When cooldowns weren't ready, he'd descended and waited. Then flown again. The cycle repeated endlessly until Cork Island materialized below him.\n\n*The bright side? My Persistence stat increased.*\n\nHis stamina had bottomed out multiple times. He'd been tempted to rest—to stop, to sleep—but the thought of missing Hell Gao's spawn time drove him forward. The journey exceeded any triathlon. Pure torture. But he'd endured.\n\n*I feel incredible.* The sense of accomplishment rivaled crafting a high-rated item. *This fullness I feel when I push past my limits... Is this why people climb mountains? Why they run marathons? I should climb the mountain behind my house tomorrow.*\n\nGrid launched into the sky with renewed energy. He surveyed the island below.\n\n\"Nice city.\"\n\nCork Island was roughly a quarter the size of Jeju Island. Substantial. The mild climate had allowed the central city to flourish.\n\n*This development rivals Bairan. Population must be in the tens of thousands. Plenty of hunting grounds and rare resources.*\n\nGrid descended and entered the city. Thanks to the Hooded Zip-Up, he bypassed the gates and blended into the crowd naturally. He made his way to a restaurant near Hell Gao's dungeon—time to handle his satiety meter.\n\n\"Turtle and whale meat?\" Grid studied the menu. \"Never tried it. Any good?\"\n\nThe owner puffed his chest out. \"Of course it's delicious! A delicacy—turtle and whale together. You should absolutely try it.\"\n\nGrid had learned a few things from Huroi over the past months. The warrior Grid—the old Grid—would've spent hours chatting with NPCs to build affinity. But Huroi had taught him shortcuts. With merchant NPCs, buy their goods. Show confidence. Compliment their wares.\n\n\"I trust your judgment.\" Grid grinned. \"One plate of turtle and whale meat. Actually—bring me everything that represents this island! I'm eating double portions today!\"\n\n\"Ohh, a generous young man!\" The owner beamed. \"Excellent! I'll bring you perfectly cooked duck as well!\"\n\n*Finally.* Grid's mouth watered. Most food in the northern Eternal Kingdom was steamed—bland, unappetizing dishes that didn't match his palate. He preferred grilled, fried, stir-fried. Hot pots. Real food.\n\nCork Island's menu featured mostly grilled and fried dishes.\n\n*I'm eating until I burst.*\n\nGrid drooled while waiting. When the food arrived, he tore into it. His high Stamina and Persistence stats had expanded his stomach capacity considerably. The owner's eyes bulged as Grid demolished enough food for three people.\n\n\"You ate all that in one sitting... Impressive.\"\n\n*What would Huroi do now?*\n\nGrid wiped his mouth and smiled. \"I don't usually eat this much. Your excellent cooking made me lose control.\"\n\n\"Haha...\"\n\nGrid's high Dignity stat created a unique presence. It could intimidate weaker targets, but it could also inspire admiration. Combined with his polite demeanor and natural charm, the restaurant owner was instantly won over.\n\n\"You look like a traveler. What brings you to Cork Island?\"\n\n*Success.*\n\nGrid met the owner's curious gaze. \"I came to see the monster who commands hellfire. Can you tell me where the dungeon is?\"\n\n\"What?\" The owner's face went pale. \"You mean Hell Gao?\" He trembled. \"The dungeon is north of the city, but... I don't understand. Why would you *want* to see him? That's suicide!\"\n\n\"Is he that strong?\"\n\nThe owner's hands shook. \"He ruled this island for generations. Fed on my ancestors. Legend says he sacrificed *thousands* of people.\" He lowered his voice. \"Muller appeared one day and turned Hell Gao's body to ash. But his soul couldn't be sealed. He still manifests occasionally. The residents live in fear—terrified he'll fully resurrect and transform this island into a living hell.\"\n\nToo many vague details. \n\n*Is this a quest trigger? He's not about to ask me to seal Hell Gao's soul when even Muller failed, right?*\n\nGrid's enthusiasm dimmed. The owner leaned forward, offering advice.\n\n\"Hell Gao's black flames burn hotter than the jade fires of most demons. You must be careful.\" He pointed south. \"There's a woman named Ellen on the south side of the city. Tell her I sent you. She can dye your armor with fire stone—it'll boost your fire resistance significantly. Visit Ellen before you face Hell Gao.\"\n\n\"Dye made from fire stone?\"\n\nGrid perked up. He pressed the owner for detailed directions to Ellen's house, then headed straight there.\n\n***\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nEllen was a kindly older woman. She listened to Grid's explanation and welcomed him into her home without hesitation. She led him to a large basin in her backyard.\n\n\"It's nothing fancy. Just fire stone soaked in water mixed with my own recipe.\" She gestured at the basin.\n\nGrid peered inside. A single fire stone—roughly the size of a baby's fist—sat in the water. That one small mineral had turned the entire basin a deep red.\n\nEllen continued, \"It's not just a color change. Armor or cloth dyed with this water gains increased fire resistance. The fire stone imbues them with its properties.\"\n\nGrid pulled out the Holy Light Armor and Holy Light Gloves. \"The gloves are cloth, so they should dye easily. But this armor is mithril. Can it be dyed?\"\n\nEllen nodded without hesitation. \"Fire stones are symbols of fusion. They can bond with anything.\"\n\n*As expected from a rare mineral used in magic items.* \n\nGrid ran through the math. *My status immunity prevents burning, but this will reduce fire-based damage. Braham's Boots are black, so the red will actually look good... Perfect.*\n\nHe bowed politely. \"Would you please dye this armor and gloves for me?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Ellen smiled. \"Five hundred gold.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nGrid had assumed Ellen was a hidden NPC—a special encounter triggered by his affinity with the restaurant owner. A chance for free benefits. But she was charging him?\n\nBefore Grid could process this, other users arrived at Ellen's house.\n\n\"Are you Ellen? The grandmother at the grocery store sent me.\"\n\n\"The blacksmith told me about you. You can increase fire resistance?\"\n\nGrid watched them enter. Understanding dawned.\n\n*The restaurant owner's tip wasn't special.*\n\nEllen wasn't hidden. She was a merchant. The Cork Island NPCs were simply skilled salespeople, funneling customers to her.\n\n*The world is ruthless.*\n\nGrid pulled out five hundred gold with trembling hands. *It's not a terrible deal—five hundred gold for extra options on two items. I just don't know the exact numbers yet.*\n\nHe handed over the coin. Ellen got to work.\n\n---\n\n**[Glossary of Common Korean Terms]**\n**OG: [Glossary Link]**\n\n**Current schedule: 20 chapters a week.**\n\n**Check out my Patreon for early access to unedited chapters and to help achieve goals for extra chapters.
