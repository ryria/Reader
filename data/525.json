  "content": "*Every time I drink one of those bitter potions, I wonder why there's no way to turn off taste...*\n\nThe acrid flavor of potions remained one of Satisfy's harshest barriers to entry. More than a few players had petitioned S.A. Group to disable the taste function, but the company refused every request. Taste was a cornerstone feature—critical to maintaining immersion. Players would never receive authority to diminish that.\n\nGrid, however, saw a darker truth at play.\n\n*I can't escape tasting Idan's cooking... which means I'm screwed.*\n\nSomeone on the Satisfy development team had to be a sadist. Grid was certain of it. He flagged down the server and requested tea—anything to scrub away the subtle grit coating his tongue.\n\n\"Water... no, that won't cut it. Give me your cheapest herbal tea.\"\n\n\"The cheapest?\" the server asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You don't care about aroma or flavor? If you're ordering by price alone, I'd recommend citron tea. It's the least expensive—and it actually tastes good.\"\n\n\"Hoh?\"\n\nGrid finally *looked* at the employee he'd barely noticed. The girl was a striking beauty whose face revealed nothing—though her chest was disappointingly flat. That alone had prevented Grid from registering her as female. Still, something about her piqued his interest.\n\n*She's an NPC with considerable intelligence.*\n\nService NPCs rarely demonstrated this level of customer intuition. Satisfy's AI was sophisticated, yet vast disparities existed between individual NPCs. Most shop employees possessed intelligence only marginally superior to Jude's. The fact that this waitress working in Idan's restaurant could read him so accurately marked her as exceptional.\n\n*Could she be a diamond in the rough?*\n\nAn average player would never have noticed Yang Fei's unusual qualities. But Grid wasn't average. His focus on NPCs ran deep—a fundamental pillar of his strategy. He *knew* when something was different.\n\n\"Yes, citron tea. Please.\"\n\n\"Right away.\"\n\nYang Fei and Idan's attention drifted elsewhere as she moved to prepare the order.\n\n*Clink.*\n\nGrid withdrew the Great Lord's Sword from inventory and activated **Character Observation**.\n\n**>Ttiring~**\n\n---\n\n**Name:** Yang Fei  \n**Age:** 17 **Gender:** Female  \n**Occupation:** Restaurant Employee  \n**Title:** *Quick-witted Person*\n\n*A commoner born into an ordinary household with one son and fourteen daughters.*\n\n*As the seventh daughter among fourteen, Yang Fei shouldered responsibility for her younger sisters.*\n\n*Born and raised in a home where even a single bean sparked conflict, her survival instincts are exceptional.*\n\n**Level:** 53  \n**Strength:** 22/99 **Stamina:** 92/510  \n**Agility:** 65/250 **Intelligence:** 204/1,090  \n**Dexterity:** 139/650 **Charm:** 53/150\n\n**Skills:** Hospitality (A), Housework (A), Adaptability (S), Pushover Detection (SS)\n\n---\n\n\"...\"\n\nEven talented knights rarely possessed S-grade skills. Finding one was like discovering a bean sprouting in drought-scorched soil. Yet Yang Fei—a *mere restaurant employee*—had both an S-grade *and* an SS-grade skill.\n\n*Are all East Continent NPCs like this?*\n\nRidiculous. Yang Fei was simply special.\n\n*I need to bring her back to the West Continent with me.*\n\nShe'd make an excellent attendant for Irene and Lord, though wasting that **Intelligence** stat on simple maid duties seemed criminal.\n\n*Especially with that Pushover Detection skill...*\n\nGrid's decision crystallized instantly.\n\n*She'll be Rabbit's deputy.*\n\nRabbit—who'd transformed worthless sand into expensive longevity remedy, who'd somehow convinced Piaro to work for a mere seventy-three silver—desperately needed talent like Yang Fei's. That **Pushover Detection** was a goldmine for someone constantly scheming new revenue streams.\n\n*It's like giving him wings!*\n\nGrid's smile stretched wide across his face. The joy of discovering fresh talent washed away even the memory of Idan's toxic cooking. He laughed openly.\n\nIdan saw it and misunderstood.\n\n*This man...*\n\nHad anyone *ever* laughed while eating his food? Not since the little hero Kraugel's visit.\n\n*I had a good feeling about him from the start.*\n\nGrid possessed no status on the East Continent—merely another wandering traveler. But his high **Dignity** and **Charm** stats worked their magic regardless. Building affinity with NPCs came easily, even when Grid acted clueless. That explained why the normally reserved Idan had been so talkative since their first meeting.\n\nThe truth was simple: receiving quests from Idan wasn't normally easy at all. Grid remained oblivious to this fact. Only thirty-one players had ever reached the East Continent. Information was virtually nonexistent.\n\n\"Hrmm... You.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nGrid nearly jumped from his seat as Yang Fei placed the tea before him. Panic flared—would Idan misunderstand *again*?\n\n*If he wonders why I'm rinsing my mouth after eating...*\n\nNo question about it. His affinity would plummet.\n\n*Damn, I need more subtlety.*\n\nSurprisingly, Grid recognized one of his own flaws. He forced a nervous smile as Idan spoke.\n\n\"Smiling so happily after eating the meal I prepared... you're a true gourmet. And polite to the chef, no less.\"\n\n*What nonsense is this?*\n\nThe *chef* should be polite to the *customer*.\n\n*You can't cook worth a damn.*\n\nGrid desperately wanted to say it aloud, but maintained his smile. He needed to raise Idan's affinity. The effort paid off.\n\n\"You're a foreigner... planning to stay in Pangea for a few days? If you don't mind, I'd like to provide three meals daily—as thanks for recovering my frying pan.\"\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nThis was exactly what Grid wanted. His goal had been establishing a lasting relationship with Idan while consuming enough of his dishes to complete the quest. Idan had just promised to cook for him voluntarily. The situation exceeded his expectations.\n\nBut Grid...\n\n*...Why aren't I happy?*\n\nThe thought of eating Idan's cooking *three times daily* sent chills down his spine. He stared into space for a long moment before forcing a grin.\n\n\"Yes, I'd be honored.\"\n\n\"Ohh! Just as I thought! I knew you'd appreciate it!\"\n\n\"...Ah, for reference—I prefer chicken, beef, and eggs.\"\n\nIngredients that remained edible no matter how incompetent the chef. Idan agreed readily.\n\n\"Understood. I'll prepare your three daily meals using those ingredients.\"\n\n\"Much appreciated!\"\n\nGrid's laughter finally rang genuine.\n\n***\n\nThroughout his time at Idan's restaurant, Grid focused on building rapport with Yang Fei. Glances, casual words—he deployed every tool to raise her affinity.\n\nThe result?\n\n\"Goodbye.\"\n\nYang Fei bid Grid farewell at the restaurant entrance. Grid smiled as warmly as possible.\n\n\"Yes, thank you. I'll return this evening.\"\n\nThe first friend in Grid's life had been an NPC. His wife and companions were NPCs. He'd become an *expert* at managing NPC relationships. He felt confident he could rapidly increase Yang Fei's affinity.\n\nIn reality, he was only half right. Yang Fei's opinion of Grid *was* improving—but not for the reasons he imagined.\n\nShe possessed **Pushover Detection**. She'd read Grid's nature perfectly.\n\n*A customer who orders without checking the menu.*\n\nGrid had requested the cheapest tea without asking to see options. Yang Fei could have deceived him easily. The citron tea wasn't *actually* the cheapest—it was second-cheapest.\n\n*If I upsell him the citron tea every visit...*\n\nShe might scrape together enough to cover this month's wages. Her thoughtless siblings wouldn't have to starve.\n\nGrid sighed as he observed Yang Fei. *I'm not making enough impact. Time to deepen this relationship.*\n\nHe relaxed his grip on restraint.\n\n\"Yang Fei, I think your shoulders are too tense. Come here.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nTouching her shoulders out of nowhere? Yang Fei's head tilted with confusion. Grid unleashed his legendary dexterity. He closed the distance in an instant, fingers targeting her shoulders with surgical precision before applying firm pressure.\n\nYang Fei's expressionless mask cracked for the first time.\n\n\"*Ahak!*\"\n\nGrid saw Yang Fei as a young girl, but by Satisfy's standards, she'd reached marriageable age. Yang Fei couldn't afford to dream of marriage, though—her sisters needed to wed and leave home first. At this rate, she'd miss her prime years entirely. She'd resigned herself to never experiencing a woman's happiness.\n\nBut right now...\n\n*Ahh, this feeling must be...!*\n\nRomance had never been an option—she had family to feed. Her knowledge of male-female relationships existed purely in theory, gleaned from books. Now, finally, she experienced it firsthand. Every touch of Grid's fingertips against her skin matched the sensations described in those pages. Yes, this feeling...\n\n[Content omitted.]\n\n\"Hah... hah...\"\n\nThe expressionless mask had shattered completely. Pure joy suffused Yang Fei's flushed face as she gasped for breath. Her moist, trembling eyes fixed on Grid.\n\n\"How's that? Feel less fatigued?\"\n\n\"...Yes.\"\n\n\"Good. I'll do it whenever we meet.\"\n\n\"...!\"\n\nFor Grid, it was a massage. Yang Fei thought otherwise.\n\n*Doing this... this scandalous thing every time we meet...?*\n\nIt was mortifying. But she couldn't refuse.\n\n*Ah, I've become corrupted.*\n\nYang Fei's emotions swirled in confusion.\n\nMeanwhile, Grid headed for the White Hammer smithy. He didn't bother seeking lodging. For him, a smithy served as the perfect place to stay and work.\n\n*Fifteen hours until the blacksmith competition. I'll process the Queen Rat's Fur and eat Idan's meals.*\n\n***\n\n\"Did you see that system message from two days ago?\"\n\n\"Of course. The announcement about the thirty-first visitor?\"\n\n\"That's right. And he's *alone*.\"\n\n\"Must have minimal information about the East Continent. That's why he dared come solo.\"\n\n\"Foolish. Kukuk, I don't know who he is, but this works for us. We can feast properly.\"\n\nInside a Pangea pub, players occupied a corner table, laughing with wicked intent."
