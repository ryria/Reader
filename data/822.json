  "content": "Bone was the final fortress of any living creature. Skin yielded to a sharp edge, but bone resisted. Yet here stood Overgeared Skeleton One, shattering that last defense with mechanical precision. A reaper indeed.\n\n'A rapier. Something that can exploit those fractures.'\n\nGrid watched Overgeared Skeleton One cripple another bear-wolf—creatures that even threatened the elves—and felt an almost parental pride swell in his chest. The skeleton moved with purposeful efficiency, each strike targeting joints and weak points.\n\n\"Bah.\" Noe's fur bristled. \"I don't like skeletons. They can't compare to the best demonic beast of hell.\"\n\n\"Of course not.\" Grid scooped up the indignant cat and scratched behind his ears, though his attention remained fixed on the skeleton. His mind raced with possibilities.\n\nPermanent debuffs.\n\nThe system notification had been clear. Overgeared Skeleton One hadn't merely damaged the bear-wolf—it had *shattered* the bones in its lower body, rendering movement impossible. The implications were staggering.\n\n'It's almost unfair.'\n\nRecovery was possible, certainly. Skills like Bone Sticking could mend the damage instantly. But how many monsters possessed such abilities? Boss monsters might regenerate during their natural healing cycles, but common creatures would be crippled until death. Even players would suffer. Broken bones weren't a common affliction—few would carry the 100 gold restoration potions, and even fewer could fight through the debilitating pain.\n\nThough priests could heal the condition easily enough. Not that it mattered. Grid didn't need Overgeared Skeleton One's help against ordinary opponents. No, this skeleton's true value lay elsewhere.\n\nAgainst transcendent beings.\n\nAgainst *Agnus.*\n\nThe thought surfaced unbidden. Baal's Contractor, that sun-grade madman who styled himself lord of life and death, commanded an army of liches and death knights. He was one of the few players who existed beyond normal classifications—one of the few who could make Grid hesitate. When hunting Immortal in the empire, Grid had felt both relief and disappointment at Agnus's absence.\n\nNow, with Overgeared Skeleton One at his side, that fear had evaporated.\n\n'Where are you hiding, Agnus?'\n\nThe anger surged fresh and raw. Khan's death. Immortal's atrocities. The war between Overgeared and Immortal remained unfinished business.\n\nThe hunt continued around him. Overgeared Skeleton One's Bone Cracking skill rarely activated—its low proc rate meant most bear-wolves fell to conventional damage. But Grid wasn't concerned. With Mercedes serving as their leveling bus, the skeletons' growth was guaranteed.\n\n'I should reward the bus driver properly.'\n\nThe portable furnace had reached optimal temperature. He pulled up the inventory screens, reviewing the items he'd claimed after supporting Valhalla. Two sets of red armor and Lorex's massive axe. He'd studied these pieces extensively—disassembled, reassembled, and repaired them until his understanding hit 100%. But he'd never worn them himself. The defense was too low for his taste, and Triple Layers offered more reliable protection.\n\nFor Mercedes, though? Different story entirely.\n\nAs a legendary knight, she received significant bonuses when wearing heavy armor. The red armor's unique properties would amplify her natural abilities far better than chain mail ever could. And she'd worn red armor for years—she knew its weight, its balance, its rhythm in combat.\n\n'Though her original set would've been even better. The emperor's generosity has limits, apparently.'\n\nHe began mentally designing the modifications. Higher ore content meant greater durability and defense, at the cost of increased weight. Mercedes fought like he did—absorbing attacks, deflecting with armor, retaliating with devastating force. She relied on momentum rather than speed. The design crystallized in his mind: full coverage, maximum protection, even if it cost her some mobility.\n\nThe Overgeared King flexed his fingers. In the furnace, metal glowed white-hot.\n\n\"Let's begin.\"\n\nThe scene defied belief. Deep in an elven forest untouched by humans for centuries, skeletons cackled over the screams of dying bear-wolves. A legendary knight drilled sword forms with mechanical precision. A legendary farmer hummed while pruning ancient trees. And a legendary blacksmith's hammer rang out in steady rhythm.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nNo witness would credit the tale.\n\n***\n\n\"Why is the ward down?\"\n\nMerchant King Kir studied the exposed forest ahead. Behind him, his procession stretched into the distance—hundreds of men disguised as merchant escorts, weighted donkeys and creaking wagons completing the illusion. Only Kir himself held merchant credentials. The rest were warriors.\n\n\"They removed it to welcome me back,\" Kir said, smile vulpine. \"Trusting fools. The elves believe every word from my mouth.\"\n\nTen days prior, his performance had been flawless. He'd infiltrated their village, gained their confidence, and poisoned the World Tree with Yatan Essence while they slept. When the tree's sudden illness sparked panic, he'd deflected suspicion toward other humans and volunteered to retrieve medicine. The elves had wept with gratitude.\n\nThree hours remained before the Yatan Essence lost its potency. Perfect timing.\n\n\"What happens after we collect the payment?\" one of his men asked.\n\n\"The elves' treasures are the tree's branches, leaves, and fruit.\" Kir's smile widened. \"If they refuse to hand over everything...\"\n\n\"Then we take it by force?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nWicked laughter rippled through the procession as they disappeared into the forest depths."
