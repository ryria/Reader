The loan sharks at Mother's Heart is Happy Financial Services had made his life a living hell.\n\nEvery day meant backbreaking labor just to cover interest payments. He'd been a slave in all but name, with no hope of escape. Luxuries like love or even a cheap bottle of soju had been fantasies he couldn't afford to dream.\n\nThat world felt like a lifetime ago.\n\nThe legendary class had changed everything. Since the Malacus raid and the sale of Thorn of Deep Grievance to Ibellin, he'd earned 4.61 billion won. After the trading site took its 5% commission, after paying off the last of his family's debt, after buying the car... he still had 2.95 billion won left.\n\nThese days, Grid could afford chicken. Real chicken. Once every two weeks, he could eat an entire bird by himself without rationing portions. The taste of freedom. But he wasn't satisfied yet. Ten billion won. That was the number. Enough to buy land and build something permanent, something that couldn't be taken away.\n\nBut first, he needed to craft Failure.\n\nWhich meant he needed blue orichalcum.\n\nGrid had scoured every auction house, both in-game and online. Nothing. Either no one had successfully raided the Guardian of the Forest, or the drop rates were abysmal, or another blacksmith had cleaned out the market. The reason didn't matter.\n\n*If I can't buy it, I'll take it myself.*\n\nHe had three pieces from selling the Sword of Self-transcendence to Administrator Vladi. He needed twelve more.\n\nSo here he stood, staring at the Guardian of the Forest's territory.\n\n\"Here.\"\n\nThe deepest part of the Grey Forest had been reduced to a massive crater. Ash-tinged trees ringed the barren ground. Grid studied the terrain, calculating angles and cover.\n\n*No natural barriers. The trees will crumble like crackers under that thing's weight. This'll be a straight fight.*\n\nHe wasn't particularly worried. As long as his knights and soldiers could occupy the summoned golems, he'd have a clear shot at the Guardian. But the troops behind him were trembling.\n\n\"E-Excuse me, Viscount...\" One soldier's voice cracked. \"Shouldn't we turn back?\"\n\n\"Please, save us!\" Another man clutched at his armor. \"If I die, my wife and children—\"\n\n\"I'm still young...\"\n\nGrid had demonstrated his power on the march here. It hadn't helped. He yanked off the broad-brimmed hat he'd been using to hide his identity and equipped the Holy Light Crown instead. The Commander's Sword came out next, boosting his Dignity stat even higher.\n\n\"The Guardian of the Forest?\" Grid swept his gaze across the cowering soldiers. \"I killed Malacus, the terror of the continent. You think some overgrown golem scares me? Believe in me.\"\n\n\"O-Ohhh...!\"\n\nHis Dignity sat at 364 points base. Add 200 from the crown, 30 from the sword... nearly 600 total. The kind of presence kings cultivated over decades. The effect was immediate and visceral. Even Romeo and Deck, the knights, found themselves bowing without thinking.\n\n\"We have faith in you, Viscount.\" Romeo's voice was steady now. \"We'll follow without complaint.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nGrid turned back to the crater. *So where the hell is it?*\n\nHe'd paid 130,000 won for that premium raid schedule site. Today was supposed to be respawn day, perfect timing. He'd even worn the hat to avoid other raid parties spotting him.\n\nBut the clearing was empty. No competitors. No boss.\n\n*Don't tell me that site was a scam.* Six chickens. That membership had cost him six chickens. His jaw clenched. *Bastards.*\n\nGrid kicked a rock in frustration.\n\nThe rock started shaking.\n\n\"Amazing!\" Jude clapped his hands. \"The rock you kicked is dancing!\"\n\n\"That's not—\"\n\nThe ground erupted.\n\nWhat Grid had taken for a boulder unfurled, rising, expanding. Like a turtle emerging from its shell, the Guardian of the Forest revealed itself.\n\nBut something was wrong.\n\n\"What the hell?\"\n\nThe Guardian of the Forest should have been over five meters tall, a lumbering mountain of stone and ore. This thing was human-sized. Sleek. Its body was composed of transparent crystal rather than rock, save for the armored plating across its back. Five fingers. Five toes. Almost human proportions.\n\nThe name floating above its head read: **Awakened Guardian of the Forest**.\n\nGrid tried to check its combat power. The system returned: **[???]**\n\nHis instincts screamed danger.\n\nThe Awakened Guardian closed the distance before Grid could react.\n\n**Kwaang!**\n\nThe shockwave scattered ash and tore roots from the earth. Grid caught a glimpse of movement, fluid and precise. *Like watching Regas.*\n\nA kick snapped out with surgical precision.\n\nDeck coughed blood and dissolved into light.\n\n**[The knight Deck has died.]**\n\n\"Crazy!\"\n\nA one-shot kill on a level 185 knight? Grid's hand plunged into his inventory. \"Avoid it! Especially you, Jude! You absolutely must survive!\"\n\nHis knights and soldiers were already useless. The black greatsword materialized in his grip. Dainsleif's massive blade caught the moonlight.\n\n---\n\n**Forty-seven days.**\n\nThat's how long Vantner had been waiting.\n\nGrid had promised him armor. After Pon and Ibellin, Vantner was supposed to be the third recipient of Grid's legendary craftsmanship.\n\n*Once I get that armor, I'll be truly Overgeared!*\n\nWith Grid's strongest plate protecting him, Vantner could finally stop playing cautiously. He could charge in, take hits, dominate the battlefield. The anticipation had kept him awake at night.\n\nThen Grid vanished on some quest. No word. No updates.\n\nA fortnight passed. Then a month. Then six weeks. Vantner haunted Winston's streets, jumping at every complaint muttered by passing players, spinning around whenever he spotted an Asian man.\n\nGuild chat was silent. Whispers went unanswered.\n\n*That bastard.* Vantner had cursed Grid's name a thousand times.\n\nBut as the days dragged on, something shifted. The anger transformed into something else. Longing. Obsession.\n\nThen, four days ago, Grid returned.\n\nVantner had run to meet him, heart pounding like a lover's reunion. Finally, his armor. Finally—\n\nGrid announced his marriage.\n\nTo Lady Irene.\n\n*My* Lady Irene.\n\nVantner had gotten drunk at the wedding and made a scene. The details were fuzzy, but he remembered cursing Grid before being thrown out.\n\nThe next morning brought crushing shame. Irene had never been his. She'd been a fantasy, nothing more. How could he blame Grid for winning her heart?\n\nFor three days now, Vantner had camped outside Khan's smithy, waiting for a chance to apologize. To beg for his armor. But Grid hadn't shown up once since the wedding.\n\n\"Hey, old man.\" Vantner tried again. \"Why won't you tell me where Grid went?\"\n\nKhan didn't even look up from his anvil. \"You cursed at Grid on his wedding day. I don't want trash like you anywhere near him.\"\n\n\"Are you serious—\"\n\n\"Get out of my shop.\"\n\nTwisted old bastard. Made sense that he got along with Grid. Vantner finally broke down and contacted Jishuka through whisper.\n\n*—Master, can you go see Irene?*\n\n*—You want me to ask about Grid's whereabouts?*\n\n*—Yes...*\n\n*—Fine. It's time Grid remembered his duties to the guild anyway.*\n\nThe Tzedakah Guild had recruited Grid for his blacksmithing. Grid had joined to fill that role. As guild master, Jishuka had every right to remind him of his obligations.\n\nShe returned from visiting Irene with a headache.\n\n\"Grid went to fight the Guardian of the Forest?\" Jishuka pressed her fingers to her temples. \"Alone?\"\n\n\"Well, not alone.\" Irene's eyes sparkled. \"He took soldiers. He said he wanted to defeat it for our sake. Isn't he like a prince from a fairy tale? So cool.\"\n\n\"...This is a disaster.\"\n\nSatisfy was ruthlessly competitive. Users and guilds fought for every advantage. One of the simplest strategies was hunting ground monopolization. Control the best spawns, ban outsiders, profit.\n\nThe Tzedakah Guild monopolized two hunting grounds near Bairan. Ruger Dungeon for level 250+ monsters, and the Grey Forest for the Guardian of the Forest.\n\nThe Guardian was a nightmare boss. Level 245, field boss category, but with stats exceeding most dungeon bosses. Wide-range CC skills. Constant summons. Passive physical damage reduction. Even with the guild's full roster, clearing it took three hours minimum.\n\nAnd Grid had gone there with a hundred soldiers and two knights.\n\n*During the awakening cycle.*\n\nOnce every four months, twin full moons rose together. The blue orichalcum that formed the Guardian's body resonated with the moonlight, triggering a transformation. The Awakened Guardian sacrificed health and defense for overwhelming offense and speed.\n\nFour months ago, the Tzedakah Guild had challenged it unprepared. They'd been massacred.\n\n*The Awakened Guardian hits harder than Pope Drevigo. Grid's dead.*\n\nEven the guild avoided the Grey Forest during awakening cycles. They weren't planning to attempt the awakened version for another four months, after more preparation.\n\nGrid's chances of survival were zero.\n\n*Maybe this is for the best.*\n\nIf Grid actually participated in the guild community, he would have known about the monopoly. He could have asked for blue orichalcum directly. But he didn't. He ignored guild chat, pursued solo activities, acted like the Tzedakah Guild was a convenience rather than a team.\n\nMaybe dying here would teach him a lesson. Make him realize that guilds existed for mutual benefit.\n\n*He needs to learn.*\n\n---\n\nOutside Khan's smithy, Vantner clicked his tongue after Jishuka explained the situation via whisper.\n\nHe wanted to help, but the Grey Forest was too far. By the time he arrived, Grid would be long dead.\n\n*He's going to be furious after losing experience. He might refuse to make my armor out of spite.*\n\nVantner's stomach churned.\n\nA figure approached the smithy. Khan's demeanor transformed instantly, the sour old man replaced by an enthusiastic host.\n\n\"Ohh! Has it really been months?\"\n\n\"It's good to see you.\" The stranger smiled. \"Has my liege been well?\"\n\n\"Huh? You haven't heard the news? He's become tremendously successful. In fact, he's currently on another brave raid...\" Khan suddenly paused, leaning in to whisper something in the man's ear.\n\nThe stranger's smile widened. \"As expected. My liege ran from the Frostlight Orc Chief, and now he's soloing field bosses? I need to see this.\"\n\nHe bid Khan farewell and stepped outside. A sharp whistle pierced the air. A drake descended from the sky, and the man mounted it in one smooth motion. Seconds later, he was airborne.\n\nVantner stared.\n\n\"I've never seen that ID among the ranked drake masters.\"\n\nAnother rookie breaking into the scene? Vantner's frustration deepened. The world was moving forward while he stood still, waiting for armor that might never come.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms**  \n[OG: Glossary Link]\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to unedited chapters.
