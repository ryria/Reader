Yet this farmer blocked his path with the wary stance of a seasoned warrior.\n\n*What did I do?*\n\nThe man's attitude made no sense. Kraugel's mind worked through the puzzle, searching for a logical explanation.\n\nReidan sat isolated in the desert. Grid and the Overgeared Guild had been clearing the sands, but accessibility remained low. Only parties of rankers made it through alive. Few outsiders survived the journey.\n\n*No visitors means no trust. They're not used to strangers.*\n\nThe logic settled into place. Kraugel's expression remained calm, his voice measured. \"I am an ordinary adventurer. I'm not suspicious. You don't need to worry.\"\n\nHis reputation across the continent exceeded 40,000. Since Satisfy's launch, he'd held first place without interruption. Dungeons cleared faster than anyone else. Quests completed ahead of the pack. At present, Kraugel stood as the only person qualified to access the Reputation Store.\n\n*High reputation builds NPC trust. He'll lower his guard now.*\n\nBut the farmer didn't step aside. His eyes narrowed. \"Based on your stride, you're not ordinary.\"\n\nKraugel's smile never wavered. Inside, his mind sharpened to a point.\n\n*He saw through White Light Steps?*\n\nThe skill came with the White Swordsman class. It increased movement speed and terrain adaptation, enabled dashing and evasion. The white glow only became visible under intense sun or clear moonlight. For this farmer to recognize it from a casual walk...\n\n*Not ordinary.*\n\nThe NPC wore the uniform of his profession. A straw hat against the sun. Dirt-stained work clothes. A hand plow and hoe gripped in calloused hands. Every detail screamed farmer. But appearances lied.\n\nKraugel's sharp gaze dissected the man. \"Who are you really? You're not a normal farmer.\"\n\nPiaro's mouth opened. *I have dreamed of a confrontation with someone like you. Someone seeking the realm of sword saint. Compete with me.* The words formed on his tongue.\n\n\"I...\"\n\n\"Piaro! Break time! You worked hard today, so eat well!\"\n\nAnother farmer's voice cut through the tension. The timing was exquisite, in the worst possible way. Piaro's jaw tightened.\n\n\"Eat without me.\" The words came out clipped. He turned back to the stranger. \"I...\"\n\n\"Piaro! Administrator Rabbit wants to know if you found another water source yet?\"\n\nA soldier this time. Piaro's eye twitched.\n\n*Are you serious right now?*\n\nThe interruptions were testing his patience. But a potential sword saint didn't lose composure over minor annoyances. He inhaled slowly.\n\n\"Finding water isn't easy. Tell him it will take more time.\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nThe soldier retreated. Piaro opened his mouth again. \"I...\"\n\nKraugel raised one hand. His voice held certainty. \"I understand without you saying it. You're a geomancer, aren't you?\"\n\n*What?*\n\nGeomancers specialized in topography-based detection. Kraugel's sharp mind had constructed a narrative from incomplete data. \"Don't worry. I've trained many skills, but I have no intention of harming Reidan. I just want to visit the general store.\" He moved to step around. \"I'll be on my way.\"\n\nPiaro stood frozen. The misunderstanding was complete. Mistaken for a farmer, then a geomancer. But did it matter what label this stranger used?\n\n*No. What matters is testing his strength.*\n\n\"You can't enter Reidan unless you knock me down first.\"\n\nThe hoe moved. A line of force cut through the air. The attack came without warning, but Kraugel's **Keen Senses** passive flared. White Light Steps carried him aside. The hoe twisted mid-flight like a living serpent, orbit changing to track its target.\n\nKraugel's eyes went cold. Natural talent and relentless training had forged him into something beyond ordinary players. He didn't get hit easily.\n\nSilver flashed in the sunlight. White Fang cleared its sheath. The legendary sword once belonged to the great demon Drasion, defeated by Sword Saint Muller himself.\n\n**CHENGKANG!**\n\nHoe met blade. Strength contested strength. Piaro's eyes lit up when Kraugel's stance didn't budge.\n\n\"Indeed! You truly aren't ordinary!\"\n\n\"You will regret this.\"\n\nKraugel's voice dropped several degrees. He showed kindness to allies. To enemies, he showed precision. Piaro's actions had moved him from the first category to the second.\n\n**KAKAKANG!**\n\nWhite Fang slid down the hoe's shaft, point angling for Piaro's thigh. Enough momentum behind it to sever the leg entirely. The hand plow intercepted.\n\n**JEEEONG!**\n\nThe repulsive force launched Kraugel skyward. Piaro's feet sank into the earth, the soil cracking around his ankles. He called up to the airborne figure, whose gentle expression had transformed into controlled fury.\n\n\"I am someone seeking the status of sword saint! I formally apply for a duel!\"\n\n\"Sword saint?\"\n\nThe **Sword Saint Candidate** title sat among Kraugel's achievements. He'd earned it through hunting and raiding, developing his swordsmanship organically. After receiving the nomination, his drive had intensified. A legendary class awaited at the end of this path. He'd turned down countless hidden class offers in pursuit of it.\n\nBut progress had stalled at stage three. Five stages minimum were required. The gap between ambition and reality stretched wide.\n\n*A farmer seeks this realm. No... a geomancer.*\n\nPride stung in Kraugel's chest. This man spoke of becoming a sword saint while wielding a hoe and hand plow. Before discussing such heights, he should at least be holding a sword.\n\n\"You haven't grasped the subject.\"\n\nHis sentences shortened. Anger condensed his speech.\n\n**TAACK!**\n\nWhite Light Steps shifted into an advanced application. Kraugel shot through the air like a meteor. The force flattened wheat stalks and cratered the ground. **Meteor Sword** manifested.\n\n*Wonderful!*\n\nPiaro's eyes widened. The technique required maximal physical stats and perfect control. A lesser body would shatter attempting it. Piaro crossed hoe and hand plow into a flawless defensive configuration.\n\n**PEEEEEONG!**\n\nKraugel's white clothing snapped like storm-caught flags. His expression twisted. Piaro's face split into a grin.\n\n*Farming equipment blocked my sword?*\n\n*My whole body is singing! This feeling... this is being alive!*\n\n**CHAAENG! CHAEEEEENG!**\n\n**Syuok!**\n\nThe exchanges blurred together. Piaro vanished from Kraugel's front line, materialized at his back, struck.\n\n*Drasion's speed!*\n\nThe great demon might have fallen, but his dignity as one of the 33 hadn't been completely stripped away. Among all bosses Kraugel had raided, Drasion ranked strongest. High-ranking demonkin couldn't compare.\n\nYet a geomancer matched that speed. Exceeded it, even. This was no geomancer. A hermit, perhaps. One who should be an ally but had chosen to become an obstacle instead.\n\n**KAANG!**\n\n\"React to this!\"\n\nPiaro's delight rang clear as Kraugel blocked the rear attack with impossible awareness. Frantic joy flooded through him. He wanted to sing.\n\n*My eyes were correct!*\n\nA day like any other. Dawn training with the sword. Morning work in the fields. The pleasure of honest sweat. Then Kraugel appeared. The moment Piaro saw the white-clothed figure, recognition sparked. This person was stronger than anyone he'd encountered so far.\n\n\"Hahahahat!\"\n\nAgainst the doppelganger, he'd merely supported Grid. This duel would forge him into something greater. Joy propelled him forward. The hoe aimed for Kraugel's chest. The strike missed.\n\n*I'm adapting quickly.*\n\nA clear pattern emerged from Piaro's techniques. They built from a specific swordsmanship foundation, the hoe and hand plow substituting for longsword and dagger. Each stab came rapid and efficient.\n\nFor Kraugel, reading the pattern proved simple.\n\n**CHAAENG!**\n\n\"Hah...\"\n\nAdmiration escaped Piaro's lips. Watching Kraugel attack and defend in unified motions was beautiful. Kraugel studied the light wounds marking Piaro's frame, then spoke.\n\n\"You are strong, but aren't you lacking to become a sword saint?\"\n\nTop rankers had given Kraugel many titles. God of Control. Lord of the Counter. His confidence had foundations. Quick intelligence and accurate predictions dissected enemy patterns. Exquisite reflexes and precise movements converted analysis into counterattacks. The more obvious the form, the easier the counter.\n\n\"I also know my shortcomings. That's why I applied for a duel.\" Up to now, Piaro had used imperial swordsmanship. The same style he'd briefly employed against Grid at Loran Falls. \"But now it will be different.\"\n\n**Ching!**\n\nPiaro discarded the hoe and hand plow. His hands found the sword resting in the field's corner. The posture he assumed belonged to Supreme Swordsmanship.\n\n\"Open your eyes!\"\n\n**Swaeek!**\n\nExtreme speed. The stab fired like a bullet. A hole opened in Kraugel's flesh, blood pouring. But the attack wasn't one-sided. White Fang curved outward, partially deflecting the thrust. Kraugel had captured the stab's narrow vulnerability with surgical precision.\n\n\"Then what about this? Supreme Swordsmanship 1st style.\"\n\nMomentum built like a collapsing mountain. Kraugel determined defense was impossible. He reached for White Light Steps. His body refused to respond, an intangible force binding his movements. He responded with a skill instead.\n\n\"Storm Sword!\"\n\n**KWA KWA KWA KWANG!**\n\nThe storm of white blades crashed into Piaro's slash. A powerful explosion shook the earth.\n\n---\n\n*Glossary of Common Korean Terms.*  \n*OG: Glossary Link.*  \n*Current schedule: 20 chapters a week.*  \n*Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
