  "content": "In the furnace's heart, the red armor held its shape while the great axe began to liquefy, its rosar tin reaching the melting point.\n\n*Just a little more.* Grid's eyes never wavered from the flames, terrified of missing the critical moment.\n\n*Now!* \n\nThe axe melted completely. The armor's shoulders and waist began to warp. Grid's tongs plunged into the blast furnace, waves of heat scorching the surrounding grass and flowers into withered husks.\n\n\"The precious flowers...\" Several elves flinched at the destruction. Their kind had always despised human technology—most of it seemed designed solely to wound the natural world.\n\nPiaro descended from the 1,753rd tree. \"We're a weaker species than you,\" he said, his tone almost apologetic. \"We can't survive naked as you do. Technology is our substitute for your natural strength. That too is nature's providence. Perhaps you could try understanding us rather than condemning us outright.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\" The elves' voices sharpened despite their respect for Piaro. \"You claim human technology evolved for survival? No. It evolved for conquest—to steal from others, to satisfy endless wants. We hate humans because greed defines them. And greed doesn't serve providence. It *opposes* providence. What you're saying is absurd.\"\n\n\"Haha...\" Piaro's laugh was bitter. They weren't wrong. He'd spent most of his life taking what he wanted and crushing anyone who stood in his way. \"I see. Perhaps it was greedy of me to ask for understanding in the first place.\"\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"We know there are exceptions. Friendly humans. Like the young one who'll arrive soon... We think we can trust a few of you.\"\n\nBeniyaru knew the truth—Grid, Mercedes, and Piaro could slaughter every elf present if they chose. Yet they hadn't. Despite being attacked, they'd shown mercy. They were nothing like the humans from centuries past who'd burned the wildlands, consumed by lust for elven youth and beauty.\n\n\"There are many kinds of people in this world,\" Beniyaru continued slowly. \"Perhaps we'll meet more like you eventually. But we won't hold our breath. We lack the strength to endure all the betrayal and pain we'd suffer before finding another decent human.\"\n\nHundreds of years had passed, yet the wounds ran deep. The scars still ached. The elves had no desire to understand humans, nor to be understood by them.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nAs darkness settled over the World Tree's forest, only Grid's hammer broke the uncomfortable silence.\n\nMercedes, Randy, and the Overgeared Skeletons still battled bear-wolves in the distance, but the sounds were subdued—only two beasts remained. As night deepened, no new ones emerged.\n\n\"The bear-wolves grow sluggish at night,\" Beniyaru explained to Mercedes' questioning look. \"They sleep when the sun sets. No more will appear until dawn.\"\n\n\"Thank the light for that.\" The legendary knight exhaled in relief. The relentless bear-wolf assaults had tested even her limits. \n\nThe Overgeared Skeletons, however, radiated disappointment. Their eye sockets drooped as they stabbed at the remaining beasts half-heartedly, clearly eager to continue. Unlike living creatures, the undead never tired.\n\n*Perfect!* \n\nGrid grinned as he positioned both sets of red armor on the anvil and raised his hammer. He'd successfully extracted the black mithril from the ogre bones and rosar tin—the black iron plates gleamed red in the firelight. Black mithril formed the inner structure of the red armor. Some skilled craftsman had worked it well, but not perfectly.\n\nGrid set the plates on the anvil and began tempering in earnest.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\n*I can't damage the red energy. Can't lose what makes the armor unique.*\n\nThe plates needed further refinement, reshaping into their ideal form. Grid's hammer rose and fell at precise intervals. Minutes stretched into hours.\n\n[You are extremely focused. **Legendary Blacksmith's Patience** has activated.]\n\n[**Legendary Blacksmith's Breath** has activated.]\n\n[You are extremely focused. **Legendary Blacksmith's Patience** has activated.]\n\n[**Legendary Blacksmith's Breath** has...]\n\n[**Legendary Blacksmith's Breath** has increased to Lv. 7!]\n\n...\n\n...\n\nThe effect rivaled what he'd achieved creating the Enlightenment Sword. Concentration alone couldn't produce these results—he needed luck as well.\n\n*Yes!*\n\nThe perfect start. Joy surged through Grid as his focus sharpened to a razor's edge.\n\n[Your fighting energy fills the black mithril.]\n\n\"...!!\" \n\nGrid's fighting energy had remained maxed thanks to Mercedes, Piaro, and Beniyaru's presence. Now that solemn purple-red aura poured fiercely into the black mithril. The material's legendary affinity with all forms of energy revealed its true potential. The iron plates flickered with both purple and red light.\n\n*Could it be?*\n\nWould something beyond even his expectations take shape?\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nHis strikes intensified as Grid slipped into a state of perfect emptiness.\n\n*Is he even human?*\n\nThe elves stared, eyes wide, as Grid worked without pause. His dexterity and absolute concentration left them stunned. Beniyaru especially felt shaken to her core.\n\n*How can a mere human...*\n\nGrid had entered a spiritual realm higher than what elves achieved after centuries of life under nature's protection. An elevation beyond even the 12 Te's perception.\n\n*Even a high elf would struggle to reach this...*\n\nWhat sort of life had this human lived? How had he attained such mastery in mere decades? Beniyaru couldn't fathom it. Trapped in this forest by ancient wounds, she had no frame of reference for the heroes who walked the world today.\n\n*Kyak kyak!*\n\nThe final two bear-wolves fell. Then the Overgeared Skeletons—who'd been sitting puppy-like beside Grid—suddenly moved forward. They found flat rocks and began striking them with their swords, mimicking Grid's hammering rhythm.\n\n\"How precious.\"\n\n\"Haha, the little ones want to learn from their master.\"\n\nMercedes and Piaro watched with warm smiles. The skeletons looked endearing as they copied Grid's movements. \n\nFor Grid, this would have been a disaster if he'd been aware. He'd probably be screaming at them to stop—the last thing he wanted was 'blacksmith' appearing as a second class option for his Overgeared Skeletons. But what could be done? The damage was done.\n\nThe Overgeared Skeletons continued mimicking Grid's hammering. Their posture gradually aligned with his.\n\n...\n\nThe skeletons fell silent, a rare occurrence. Having grown accustomed to the physical motions, they now absorbed Grid's *concentration*.\n\n[Overgeared Skeleton One has acquired the skill **Skeleton's Patience**.]\n\n[Overgeared Skeleton Two has acquired the skill **Skeleton's Patience**.]\n\nThe notifications flickered across Grid's vision.\n\n*Ttang!*\n\n*Ttang!*\n\n*Good. Just a bit more...!*\n\nGrid remained oblivious, consumed by his work on the fighting energy-infused black mithril. \n\nAn elf approached Beniyaru and whispered, \"Kir has reached the village.\"\n\n\"Finally...!\"\n\nThe World Tree could be healed! Excitement flooded through Beniyaru. She turned to Piaro. \"We need to return to the village briefly. Will you come? I'll prepare a place for you to rest.\"\n\n\"I'll remain here.\"\n\n\"Why? It's late. More dangerous ancient species than bear-wolves may appear. You could be in danger.\"\n\n\"I won't interrupt my master's work. I'm staying with him.\"\n\n\"...His work may continue until dawn.\"\n\n\"It could take days. What of it?\" Piaro would guard Grid for a hundred years if needed. A thousand. He glanced at Mercedes. \"Take your rest.\"\n\n\"Then I'll excuse myself. I'll return for the dawn watch.\"\n\nStanding vigil with Piaro again... Mercedes felt a flutter of nostalgia for her training days as she departed. After the elves left, Noe and Randy curled up to sleep. Piaro and Mercedes traded shifts through the night while Grid's hammer never stopped.\n\n***\n\n\"Ohh...!\"\n\nIn the elves' village, rosy color bloomed in every face as they gathered beneath the World Tree—the ancient pillar sustaining their world. Five minutes after Kir sprinkled what he claimed was sacred curative water upon it, the great tree had fully recovered.\n\nAdmittedly, calling the World Tree sick was an exaggeration—only a handful of leaves had yellowed. Yet when those leaves brightened again, Kir's claims about holy water seemed validated.\n\n\"Is it Goddess Rebecca's holy water?\"\n\nElves didn't worship gods. Only the World Tree commanded their reverence. But they didn't deny divinity existed, and they held particular fondness for Rebecca, the Goddess of Light. As Kir answered their questions, his handsome features, gentle voice, and warm smile inspired confidence.\n\n*Conversing with merchants will leave you bewitched.* One of Satisfy's fundamental laws manifested in full force.\n\n\"Indeed. I rushed to the Vatican and donated my life savings.\"\n\n\"You did all this for us...\"\n\n\"You're my saviors. I'd do anything for you.\" Kir basked in their attention. Why were no male elves present? None had appeared last time either. Filing away these questions, Kir gestured to a carriage laden with jars. \"I have plenty of holy water remaining. It will fortify your health. Please, everyone take some. Shouldn't we celebrate the World Tree's recovery?\"\n\n\"Yes. Let's toast.\"\n\nThe elves had no health concerns like humans did. They lived far longer, maintaining eternal youth. Why should they drink the goddess' holy water? A few elves puzzled over this, but the moment passed quickly.\n\nKir—masterful at directing a crowd—had already pressed glasses into every hand.\n\n\"To the eternal health of the World Tree.\"\n\nKir drank first. Most elves followed suit.\n\nThen the screaming began.\n\nPoison flooded their systems. Terrible agony consumed them. Kir, the merchant who'd dealt with the Yatan Servants, revealed the true power of the Yatan Essence he'd acquired in bulk.\n\n\"Kukuk! Kuhahahaha! Is there anything easier than deceiving sheltered fools who know nothing of the world?\"\n\nHis pleasant smile had vanished. Evil laughter and elven screams drowned the village as Kir's men seized their captives."
