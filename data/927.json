The ink traced a path without hesitation—one stroke containing the weight of infinite possibility.\n\n**「The Cho Kingdom shall govern Pangea.」**\n\nAs Hanul completed the final dot, the decree was finished. The Cho King would rejoice upon receiving this imperial edict, finally able to care for the city and people he'd been forced to abandon under the Hwan Kingdom's shadow.\n\nGaram watched from beside Hanul, confusion plain on his face. \"Why grant such a favor to those wretches?\"\n\n\"A favor?\" Hanul set down his brush and turned to Garam. Compassion softened his gaze. \"This is no favor—it is recompense.\"\n\n\"The opportunity was *yours*, Garam. The people of Pangea were merely sacrificed to provide it.\"\n\nRain falls even in the desert. The heavens never abandon the earth.\n\n\"I must reward them proportionate to what I forced them to sacrifice. This is the duty I cannot forsake.\"\n\nThe sky could never afford to be one-sided. If heaven showed intolerance, countless lives would wither. The world itself would collapse the moment the sky lost sight of its obligations. This was precisely why Grid had been rewarded for answering Hanul's summons.\n\nGaram said nothing.\n\nEven one without earthly desires could not exist in pure form. As he studied Hanul—a being so similar to himself yet utterly different—Garam felt admiration and rejection warring within him.\n\n---\n\nGrid's expression was grim when he returned to the West Continent. For someone who'd just received astronomical rewards, he looked unbelievably miserable.\n\n\"This damned game is too hard.\"\n\nA quest designed to force his hand. An enemy far too powerful to defeat. A system that demanded talent he simply didn't possess.\n\nHe pulled up his skill and magic windows with a heavy sigh. \"There's... too much. Way too much.\"\n\nBetween Pagma's Swordsmanship, Braham's enhanced spells, the Rune of Darkness, and the various skills tied to his titles and items—Grid now had access to nearly thirty combat abilities. If he counted everything attached to the items he'd personally crafted, that number exceeded fifty.\n\nIt was overwhelming.\n\nHe lacked the mental acuity and reflexes to leverage what he possessed. The stronger the opponent, the more intense the situation, the worse his decision-making became. Using the right skill at the right moment was beyond him. Some things couldn't be overcome through effort alone. True geniuses could juggle fifty or sixty abilities with ease—not just thirty.\n\n\"Against weak enemies, I can afford to experiment. But Garam...\" Grid closed his eyes. \"It's been a long time since I faced someone that strong.\"\n\nHe mentally replayed the battle. First, that intangible wind—he hadn't been able to track its movements by sound alone. Invisible, omnidirectional, it had battered him from all sides while he flailed helplessly. With even minimal auditory sensitivity, he wouldn't have been so defenseless.\n\n*Though I managed to use the falling rocks as footholds when he pinned me to the ceiling. That was good thinking on my part.*\n\nHe made note of both failures and successes. This wasn't arrogance—it was necessity. If he wanted to improve, he needed to identify his strengths and weaknesses, minimize mistakes, and play to his advantages.\n\nThe more he reviewed the battle, the more he saw where he'd succeeded. Waiting for his fighting energy to reach maximum. Timing his counterattacks. Activating Blackening, Doran's Ring, the First King title effect, Ruson's Power—using the cave terrain to his advantage...\n\n*Of course, I could have done more.*\n\nHe hadn't cast a single spell. Hadn't given proper commands to the Light Sword or Blade Aiming at the Gods. Hadn't fully controlled Cray's Power. Had completely forgotten about Dark Bus' Ring, which could *delete* enemy skills.\n\nDark Bus' Ring made him think of how Garam had neutralized Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle—that spear had possessed the same skill-erasing property, and Garam had swung it faster than Grid's casting speed, destroying each stage of the technique before it could execute.\n\n\"Ugh! There are too many skills! Too many items!\" Grid raked his fingers through his hair. \"And Noe, why do you always fail Soul Ingestion when it matters most?\"\n\n\"His attack penetrated Fluidization, nyong! Too strong, nyang! It hurt...\"\n\nGrid sighed.\n\nAfter several more mental run-throughs, he reached a conclusion: the game's difficulty was simply too high. How many players in the world could actually utilize dozens of skills and items like Kraugel?\n\n*If I could increase individual skill power while reducing the total number, gameplay would be far more manageable.*\n\nPerhaps he'd submit feedback to customer service for the first time in ages. A very *polite* message.\n\nHis studying and grumbling complete, Grid turned his attention to reality. Time to check Tiramet's Belt.\n\n---\n\n> **[Tiramet's Belt]**  \n> **Rating:** Legendary  \n> \n> **Effects:**  \n> * Reduce damage received by 15%  \n> * Stamina +250  \n> * Health +10,000  \n> * Generates skill 'Wind of Regeneration'  \n> \n> A belt containing the unique magic power of Vampire Viscount Tiramet.  \n> \n> ★ **Final evolution complete.**  \n> You can summon Vampire Viscount Tiramet by consuming 1,500 mana. If Tiramet dies in battle, he cannot be summoned again for 24 hours.\n\n> **[Wind of Regeneration]**  \n> Passive skill.  \n> Tiramet's magic power boasts exceptional regenerative properties, keeping the wearer's body healthy. Health recovery speed is greatly increased—restores 500 health per second.  \n> Effect disappears when struck. Requires 10 seconds before reactivating.\n\nGrid's hands trembled.\n\nFour years? Five? How long had he been feeding this item experience? No—stuck at unique rating as it was, it might have taken far longer to reach final evolution. Yet it had broken through now, just before the upcoming Demon King event.\n\n*Damage reduction increased by fifteen percent. Health increased by ten thousand. That's why I survived more of Garam's attacks than I should have.*\n\nThe difference from its unique-rated state was night and day. The rumors were true—growth-type items only revealed their true power after final evolution.\n\nHe glared at Elfin Stone's Ring, whose experience gauge remained stubbornly stagnant, then pulled up Tiramet's status.\n\n---\n\n> **[Name: Tiramet]**  \n> **Age:** 295 | **Gender:** Male  \n> **Species:** Vampire  \n> **Level:** 300  \n> \n> **Title: Immortal Noble**  \n> * Immediately recovers 30% of damage received. Charges once per hour, maximum 12 stacks.  \n> * Does not activate if a single attack exceeds 60% of maximum health.  \n> * Cannot recover from divine damage.  \n> * Upon death, resurrects with 100% health. All stats increase by 20% for one hour after resurrection. (Activates at level 360.)  \n> \n> **Title: Depressed**  \n> * Ashamed of being bound to a human despite being a child of Shizo Beriache. Self-esteem critically low. Morale degraded. All stats reduced.  \n> \n> **Physical Attack Power:** 2,150 | **Magic Attack Power:** 100  \n> **Health:** 100,000 | **Mana:** 3,000  \n> **Defense:** 2,500 | **Magic Resistance:** 500  \n> \n> **Skills:** Block One Blow! (A), I Wonder Why I'm Alive... (C), Headbutt (C)  \n> \n> **Status:** Depressed  \n> *(Resurrected after a long time, only to die immediately. Why am I alive... I'd rather be dead...)*\n\n\"...Depressed. Of course he is.\"\n\nTiramet's condition was abysmal. Gone was the overwhelming strength of the vampire viscount who'd required a Demon Slayer's assistance to raid.\n\n\"Well, he *was* classified as a boss monster back then. Expecting a summoned pet to match that level is unrealistic.\"\n\nStill, Grid's expression brightened. Tiramet wasn't what he once was, but calling him weak would be inaccurate. Hadn't 'Block One Blow!' just saved them from one of Garam's techniques? And his base stats were excellent—attack power equivalent to a unique-rated weapon, defense matching unique-rated armor.\n\nMost importantly: the equipment system. Unlike Noe, Tiramet was humanoid, meaning he could wear gear. And unlike Randy, who only copied weaker versions of Grid's items, Tiramet could equip authentic equipment at full strength.\n\n*If I gear him as a tank, I can solo dungeons.*\n\nHe'd be a powerful shield during the Demon King Subjugation event. Starting tomorrow, Grid would begin crafting Tiramet's loadout.\n\nNext, he reviewed his East Continent rewards: one unique-rated weapon production method, two unique-rated armor production methods, ten blessed weapon enhancement stones, one hundred seven weapon enhancement stones, twenty blessed armor enhancement stones, and three random elixirs.\n\n\"I completely cleaned them out...\"\n\nThe quest rewards seemed almost too generous. Fortunately, they were real—his inventory groaned under their weight.\n\n\"I'll use the unique production methods for Tiramet's gear.\"\n\nGrid produced items of at least epic rating consistently, but that didn't mean unique-rated items came easily. He still relied heavily on luck for anything unique or higher. Having guaranteed unique-rated production methods was solid insurance.\n\n\"The enhancement stones go toward upgrading my equipment immediately.\"\n\nThe probability of successfully enhancing myth-rated items hovered around 0.00001%. Selling precious enhancement stones for quick cash would be idiotic, and Grid wasn't that stupid.\n\n\"Maybe I can reach +3... no, +2. Just +2 would be fine.\"\n\nFinally, he turned his attention to the elixirs.\n\nThree random elixirs—thirty stat points total. Equivalent to three full levels. He checked his main stats.\n\n---\n\n> **[Name: Grid]**  \n> **Level:** 364  \n> \n> **Strength:** 3,220 (+360)  \n> **Stamina:** 2,047 (+580)  \n> **Agility:** 2,750 (+330)  \n> **Intelligence:** 1,898 (+405)\n\n\"Lost some intelligence when I changed crowns. But it's not bad.\"\n\nThe world called him Overgeared, and Grid didn't deny it. Yet his greatest advantage was actually his stats. Thanks to over twenty-six equipped items and the high ratings of his self-made gear, Grid's primary stats were roughly double those of same-level users. Those stats were what allowed him to fight named NPCs and bosses on relatively even ground.\n\nStandard elixirs came in four varieties: strength, stamina, agility, and intelligence.\n\n\"Random elixirs should increase one of those four major stats...\"\n\nWhat Grid wanted most was agility. Completing the golden ratio—achieving perfect 1:1 balance between strength and agility—would trigger higher attack power corrections. But would his luck actually cooperate?\n\nHe didn't expect much. He knew his fortune all too well.\n\n\"Stamina would be acceptable. My maximum health already exceeds 150,000. I'm aiming for 200,000.\"\n\nThanks to the First King title, increased maximum health translated to significant gains. Stamina wouldn't disappoint.\n\n\"Strength... well, it's not bad. Intelligence...\"\n\nSince Braham's enhanced spells scaled with intelligence, that stat might actually be second-most important after agility. Still, Grid's desire for intelligence remained lukewarm. More magic power didn't help if he couldn't use spells properly anyway.\n\n\"Ha... ha... ha... Please... don't let it be... intelligence...\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, fingers wrapping around a random elixir. Whatever he hoped for, experience suggested he'd receive the opposite. Grid hesitated, then finally downed the potion in one gulp.\n\nThe effect was immediate—and different from standard elixirs that only raised primary stats.\n\n> **[Random elixir effect: Dexterity increased by 10 points.]**\n\n\"Are you *kidding* me?!\"\n\nHe'd been trying so hard not to swear. Why did this keep happening?\n\nTears sprang to Grid's eyes.\n\nWhat he didn't realize yet: a random elixir raising dexterity meant it could increase *any* special stat, not just the four primary ones. And there weren't merely three elixirs waiting for him—dozens of blacksmiths would soon arrive bearing gifts."
