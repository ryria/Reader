Pagma's Swordsmanship alone made it combat-viable. The stat gains from production? Absurd. By every metric, it screamed *damage dealer*.\n\nBut strip away the illusions, and the truth remained: I was a blacksmith.\n\nAppraisal. Repair. Enhancement. Production. Creation. These weren't side features. They *were* the class. The anvil was my throne. The furnace, my battlefield. Everything else? Just a bonus for surviving long enough to swing a hammer.\n\nI wiped sweat from my brow and began loading the blast furnace. Mithril ore. Coke. Limestone. My hands moved on autopilot.\n\n> [Environmental temperature fluctuation detected. 30°C. 31°C. 31.5°C. 33°C. 36°C. 39°C...]\n\nThe system's commentary was unnecessary. I could *feel* the heat crawling up my skin. One of the class perks: if a furnace existed within range, I knew its exact internal temperature. No guesswork. No thermometers.\n\nThe bellows roared under my hands. This wasn't mastery. Mastery was for mortals. This was something higher.\n\n> [1,000°C. 1,100°C. 1,350°C...]\n\n*Mithril.*\n\nMost blacksmiths lived and died by iron. Simple. Reliable. Iron ore smelted clean between 1,150 and 1,250 degrees. But mithril? Mithril was a jealous mistress. She demanded precision. A narrow window between 1,820 and 1,840 degrees. Go too low, and the ore stayed inert. Too high, and it burned to slag.\n\nThat's why the forums said you needed Advanced Blacksmith Mastery Level 3 minimum. Most smiths couldn't even *reach* 1,800 degrees, let alone hold it steady. Level 2 masters could hit the mark, but controlling it? Impossible.\n\nFor Pagma's Descendant? Child's play.\n\nI'd already worked mithril for the Divine Shield. I could do this blindfolded. But complacency killed. I kept my eyes locked on the furnace mouth as the temperature climbed.\n\nThe air shimmered. The metal began its slow, glowing surrender.\n\nInside the blast furnace, the ore liquefied, mingling with carbon monoxide from the coke. The result: pig iron infused with carbon and mithril. Meanwhile, the limestone did its silent work, binding impurities into slag and ushering them out.\n\nModern metallurgy, recreated in a fantasy world. The forums had entire threads dissecting Satisfy's smelting logic.\n\n*Why do I need to understand the principles? I'm not taking an exam. I just need to make it work.*\n\nI tilted the crucible. Molten mithril poured into the mold, glowing a deep, hypnotic orange. Beautiful. Almost painfully so.\n\n*Prettier than... than...*\n\nWait.\n\n\"What the hell am I thinking?\"\n\nThe words came out harsher than intended. Was I seriously comparing molten metal to women? That was a one-way ticket to being the guy who introduced himself as \"married to his job\" at fifty.\n\n*No. No, wait. I'm already not popular. If I'm going to die alone anyway, shouldn't I at least... experience something? Once? Before it's too late?*\n\nThe thought spiraled. My confidence with women had been a corpse ever since Ahyoung. When would I stop flinching at the memory?\n\n\"Pathetic.\"\n\nI shook my head and poured the rest of the melt into the prepared molds. Now came the waiting. Cooling took time.\n\n*Time is money. Move.*\n\nI couldn't afford to stand idle. Every wasted second was another won I'd never recoup. The clothes. The haircut. The meal with Ahyoung. All of it had to be paid back somehow.\n\nI grabbed the Tipan wood from the corner and set to work.\n\nTipan was bamboo's vicious older brother. Dozens of times harder. More resilient. That transparent blue sheen made it a favorite for expensive ornaments, but its real value was structural. A spear shaft made of Tipan could withstand punishment that would shatter steel.\n\nOf course, it cost a fortune. Only the rich used it for decoration.\n\nI trimmed the wood into a straight, 178-centimeter shaft. Tested the grip. Swung it a few times.\n\n*Even with this flex, the tensile strength matches steel. No wonder it's expensive.*\n\nThis would form the core of the Gale Spear. Silver mithril paired with that blue translucence. Elegant. Expensive-looking. Pon would love it.\n\n\"Now for the blade.\"\n\nI pulled the semi-solid mithril from the mold and equipped my personal hammer.\n\n> **<span class=\"rarity-epic\">Unknown Blacksmith's Hammer</span>**  \n> **Rating:** Epic  \n> **Durability:** 350/350 | **Attack Power:** 70~80  \n> **Odds of Making a Rare Item:** +17%  \n> **Odds of Making an Epic Item:** +7%  \n> \n> *A hammer crafted by a blacksmith of great skill and potential, though lacking in experience and renown. Made by the smith for personal use—unsuitable for others.*\n> \n> **Restriction:** Pagma's Descendant  \n> **Weight:** 80\n\nThe increase to rare and epic odds was noticeable. I'd confirmed it over dozens of projects. But unique and legendary? Still locked behind the hammer's own rating.\n\n*If I make a unique hammer, I'll get unique odds. A legendary hammer, legendary odds.*\n\n*Soon. I'll get there.*\n\nThe hammer rose. Fell.\n\n**Clang. Clang.**\n\nI reheated the mithril. Struck it. Reheated. Struck again. Carbon content dropped with each cycle. Steelmaking, one blow at a time. The blade took shape. Slowly. Methodically.\n\nSweat soaked through my shirt. Outside the window, the pre-dawn mist crept through Winston's streets.\n\n**Clang! Clang!**\n\nThe city slept. A few adventurers shuffled home from late hunts, their footsteps muffled. Otherwise, only the hammer spoke.\n\nFour hours passed.\n\nI finished the spearhead and threaded the griffon tendons through the mount. The first of Pon's three Gale Spears lay complete on the workbench.\n\n> [Legendary Blacksmith's Breath has enhanced your work.]\n\n*Yes!*\n\nThe buff triggered. Good. The real question was the rating.\n\nI held my breath as the info window materialized.\n\n---\n\n> **<span class=\"rarity-unique\">Gale Spear</span>**  \n> **Rating:** Unique  \n> **Durability:** 432/432 | **Attack Power:** 476  \n> **Critical Chance:** +5% | **Attack Speed:** +10%  \n> \n> * Attack speed increases by 1% per consecutive hit.  \n> * Generates the skill **'True Illusion'**.  \n> * Generates the skill **'Creator's Wish'**.  \n> \n> *An item crafted by a blacksmith of great skill and potential, though lacking in experience and renown. Extremely lightweight—maximizes power in skilled hands, but may prove unwieldy for novices. Contains the creator's yearning to be reborn as the finest spear.*\n> \n> **Restriction:** Level 240+, 750 Strength, 400 Agility, Advanced Spear Mastery Lv. 2  \n> **Weight:** 200\n\n> [A unique rated item has been produced. All stats have permanently increased by +12. Reputation across the continent has risen by +300.]\n\n\"Huh? Wait—*what?!* Oh—*ohhhhh!* HELL YES!\"\n\nI'd made two legendary items before this. The Sword of Self-transcendence. The Perfect Divine Shield. But my only unique? The Ideal Dagger. Legendary items were *technically* rarer than uniques, but the gap was negligible. Both sat in the \"near-impossible\" category.\n\nAnd I'd just pulled it off. First try.\n\n\"Hahaha! YES!\"\n\nElation didn't cover it. I could fly. I could *sprint* through walls.\n\n*And the Breath bonus pushed it even further.*\n\nThe production method specified a unique Gale Spear at 363 durability and 400 attack. Mine clocked in at **432** and **476**. That was a 19% boost over the blueprint.\n\nLegendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship (Lv. 2): +12% to item stats.  \nLegendary Blacksmith's Breath (Lv. 2): +7% effectiveness.\n\nThe math was beautiful.\n\n\"What's this Creator's Wish skill?\"\n\nI pulled up the description.\n\n---\n\n> **[Creator's Wish]**  \n> Increases weapon damage by 30% for 2 minutes. Can stack with similar buff effects.  \n> **Weapon Durability Consumption:** 100\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\nThirty percent for two minutes. On paper, unremarkable. Most buff skills lasted ten minutes. This one was short.\n\nBut the *stacking* clause changed everything.\n\nIf I layered Creator's Wish over a standard weapon enchant—both granting +30% damage—the result wasn't additive. It was multiplicative. A 60% spike. Few buffs in Satisfy allowed overlap. This was a trump card.\n\nThe durability cost stung. Losing 100 points per activation wasn't trivial. But as a finisher? Worth it.\n\n\"God, this is a jackpot. Should I share this with the guild now? Watch them lose their minds?\"\n\nI pictured Jishuka's raised eyebrows. Vantner's jealous grumbling. Lauel's calculating grin.\n\nAnd Pon. Pon's face when he saw the stats.\n\nHe'd handed me the materials with zero expectations. *\"I've commissioned enough blacksmiths to know epic items are lightning strikes. Don't stress. I won't be upset if you only manage rare. Honestly, a rare Gale Spear is fine as a backup weapon.\"*\n\nIt had annoyed me at the time.\n\n\"'Don't expect epic.' 'Rare is fine.' What, you think a legendary blacksmith churns out garbage?\"\n\n...To be fair, nine out of ten items I made *were* rare.\n\n*But not this time. Unique on the first shot.*\n\nHow much would Pon pay for this? My heart hammered against my ribs.\n\n\"Three days of profit. Malacus raid. Now this. Is this real life? Feels like a dream. After I finish the commission, I need to update the ledger.\"\n\nIt was almost noon. I'd started at dusk. Over half a day, gone in a blink.\n\n\"God, I'm exhausted. I need sleep.\"\n\nThe tension drained out of me, replaced by a leaden fatigue.\n\n*Should I wait to share the info? Pon gave me three days assuming I'd make three spears. I'll wait. Show him in two days. Let him sweat.*\n\nMaybe. Just maybe.\n\nI'd aim for legendary with the remaining materials.\n\n---\n\n\"Finally. Today.\"\n\nPon had spent the last three days hunting nonstop since commissioning the spears. And for three days, his dissatisfaction with his current weapon had grown into a festering resentment.\n\nHe'd pushed into a higher-level zone for better experience. The tougher monsters exposed his Level 190 spear for what it was: outdated trash. He'd used the damn thing for 53 levels—190 to 243—but his standards had outgrown it.\n\n*I need to throw this piece of junk into a river.*\n\nHe finished a hunt and checked his gear. As he prepped for the next pull, the guild chat lit up.\n\n**{Grid}:** Pon, the three Gale Spears are done. Swing by Khan's smithy when you're free.\n\n**{Vantner}:** Ohhh! Finally! What rating did you get?!\n\n**{Jishuka}:** Curious~ ^^ Share the info window, Grid.\n\nThe guild exploded with speculation. Pon stared at the chat, half-excited, half-anxious. He waited for the spear stats to appear.\n\nInstead, Grid dropped a bomb.\n\n**{Grid}:** I'm screwed. I don't want to post it here. Just come see for yourself.\n\nVantner's cackle was practically audible through text.\n\n**{Vantner}:** ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Only rare spears, huh?! HAHAHA! Serves you right, Pon!\n\n\"...\"\n\nDisappointment curdled in Pon's gut. He'd watched Grid master the Gale Spear blueprint in minutes. Watched him enhance Vantner's axes like it was nothing. He'd hoped for at least *one* epic.\n\n\"It's fine. I'm prepared.\"\n\nThe Gale Spear's base stats were strong enough to justify a rare rating. He could work with it.\n\nPon logged out of the hunting zone and headed for Winston. The trip took three hours.\n\nWhen he arrived at Khan's smithy, half the guild was already there. Jishuka. Vantner. A few others. Vantner's grin was unbearable.\n\n\"Why are all of you here?\"\n\n\"To watch you suffer.\" Vantner leaned against the wall, arms crossed. \"Got a problem with that? Keke!\"\n\n\"...Jackass.\"\n\n\"Say it again! I'll show you what my upgraded axes can do! Kekeke!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nVantner had been insufferable ever since Grid enhanced his weapons. He'd moved to a harder hunting ground, spammed the guild chat, and mocked Pon at every opportunity.\n\n*He's living his best life. I hate how jealous I am.*\n\nPon approached Grid. The blacksmith looked half-dead, eyes ringed with exhaustion.\n\n\"Grid. Thanks for your hard work.\"\n\nHe'd told Grid not to stress about the results. He'd *meant* it. But the disappointment still clawed at him.\n\nGrid handed over three spears without ceremony.\n\n\"I'm ruined.\" His voice was flat. \"Got a unique on the first try, so I thought I'd hit legendary on the others. But... they're both epic.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nThe room went silent.\n\nUnique? Legendary? Legendary items were *theoretical*. Impossible to craft. Was Grid delirious from sleep deprivation?\n\nPon's face cycled through white, red, and blue.\n\n> [<span class=\"rarity-epic\">Gale Spear (Epic)</span> acquired.]  \n> [<span class=\"rarity-epic\">Gale Spear (Epic)</span> acquired.]  \n> [<span class=\"rarity-unique\">Gale Spear (Unique)</span> acquired.]\n\n\"...What?!\"\n\nPon had felt true exhilaration in Satisfy twice before.\n\nThe first time was the game itself. A virtual reality so seamless, so *real*, that it blurred the line between worlds. Lim Cheolho wasn't just a developer. He was a god who built a universe.\n\nThe second time was meeting Kraugel.\n\nHe and Jishuka had stumbled across him during a hunt. The encounter left Pon breathless. Watching Kraugel move was like watching perfection distilled into a player. Pon had ranked high in every game he'd touched, but that day, he felt *small*.\n\nNow, staring at the unique Gale Spear's stat window, Pon felt it again.\n\nThat third exhilaration.\n\n\"Grid. You—you—!\"\n\nThe confidence he'd lost against Kraugel roared back to life.\n\nWith Grid on their side, crossing that insurmountable wall? It didn't feel impossible anymore.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms:**  \nOG: Glossary Link.  \n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.  \nCheck out my Patreon for early access and bonus chapters!"
