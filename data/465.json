  "content": "Grid had many challenges ahead. Aslan, backed by the Saharan Empire, kept Reidan in check and had falsely accused him of murdering Prince Ren. The vampire cities needed to be conquered before war erupted. He had to uncover the 3rd Prince of the Saharan Empire's schemes and find a way to clear the Behen Archipelago. The whole process would likely connect to Hell, so he planned thorough preparations—including investing time in raising Yura.\n\nBut first, Grid had personal business.\n\n*Smelt the adamantium and bloodstone.*\n\nThe moment approached. His 15th legendary item. The third special event would trigger further growth. Lauel mentioned Kraugel had obtained the strongest combat class, but Grid refused to believe he was falling behind.\n\nThe National Competition had taught him better item usage.\n\n*Kraugel, the stronger you are, the stronger I'll become.*\n\nBefore that, though—\n\n*The building!*\n\nTen billion won. Thirteen months of construction. Finally complete. Thanks to the recognition he'd gained during the National Competition, inquiries about leasing space flooded in. The surrounding commercial district boomed. The building's value had reportedly soared from 10 billion to 15 billion won.\n\n*A top landlord. Me.*\n\nMonthly rent. Financial security. No more worrying about where his next meal came from. Grid's chest swelled.\n\n\"Father, Mother!\" He stood before his family. \"I'll protect you both now. And Sehee.\"\n\nHis mother embraced him. Tears streaked down his father's weathered face. Sehee clung to his arm. They finally understood—the hardships were over. Happiness was beginning.\n\nThe old house had sheltered them for thirty years. Now they packed it all away, moving forward.\n\n***\n\n\"Kraugel disappeared from the rankings?\"\n\nLuck's voice echoed across the supply depot.\n\nThe Belto Kingdom was poor. Remote. Underdeveloped. Every year, they sent massive tributes to the Saharan Empire just to survive. Of two billion Satisfy players, only a handful started here. The kingdom sat at the geographical edge of the continent—a place most avoided.\n\nRecently, though, things had changed. The kingdom grew stronger, absorbing weaker neighbors. Strange, considering Belto had no funds to train an army. The answer was simple: Ares and his soldiers.\n\n\"Finally got a hidden class?\" Ares sorted through seized supplies, barely glancing up.\n\nLuck's face twisted in frustration. \"That's your only reaction? He's getting stronger! You should be nervous!\"\n\n\"Why?\" Ares straightened a stack of crates. \"He nearly lost to a blacksmith. Never was my opponent.\"\n\n\"Your memory's garbage. He beat you.\"\n\n\"I was weakened. Perfect condition? I would've won.\"\n\nLuck waved a hand dismissively. \"Whatever. He's still tough.\"\n\n\"So what? Should I be shaking?\"\n\n\"No. But you should keep him in check. Won't it be scary if he keeps growing?\"\n\n\"Fine.\" Ares sighed. \"Release the kids. Handle it.\"\n\n\"On it.\"\n\nTwo billion. The number was too vast to comprehend. The best rankers who represented their countries at the National Competition? Weak compared to the countless hidden users scattered across Satisfy.\n\nThese recluses all shared one goal: mastery. Ares was one such hermit. His dream? To rule the continent. Build his own kingdom. Someday conquer the Saharan Empire itself.\n\n***\n\nSiren, the Water Clan Kingdom.\n\nThe mysterious underwater realm was small. Population: 100,000. Territory comparable to Reidan. Few hunting grounds. Fewer quests. Players rarely visited.\n\nFor Euphemina, Siren's first discoverer, it was paradise. Her title—Friend of the Water Clan—granted easy affinity gains. Hidden episodes revealed themselves constantly. Four months ago, she'd received a special quest.\n\n> **[Upcoming Destruction]**\n>\n> **★ Hidden Quest ★**\n>\n> The heart of the Water Clan contains enormous magic power.\n>\n> The prophet 'Miong' has foreseen evil humans invading Siren for this purpose.\n>\n> You share a connection with the Water Clan through Mumud, disciple of the great magician.\n>\n> Defend Siren against the unknown enemies!\n>\n> **Quest Clear Condition:** Protect Siren from enemy invasion.\n>\n> **Quest Failure Condition:** More than 70% of Siren destroyed, OR population reduced by more than 40%.\n>\n> **Quest Clear Rewards:** Title 'Defender of Siren.' Mumud's Spellbook. MAX affinity with Water Clan royal family.\n\nEuphemina didn't know the exact effects of 'Defender of Siren,' but a title earned by saving a kingdom? The bonuses would be substantial. Still, she anticipated Mumud's Spellbook most.\n\nMumud, disciple of legendary magician Braham. Several documents suggested Mumud might have surpassed even his master. Euphemina's expectations ran high.\n\n*Finally. Maximum affinity with the royal family.*\n\nYears of work building rapport with King Maxong had paid off. She'd needed his friendship to obtain his tears. That had succeeded. The princes, though—different story. The conservative princes distrusted humans. Many clashes had occurred.\n\nDefending Siren would push affinity to its peak. All princes would favor her. An opportunity to forge an alliance between Overgeared and Reidan.\n\n*Stay vigilant.*\n\nTwo months before the National Competition, Euphemina had reported the quest to Grid. He'd promised active support. She'd whispered the details, and he'd smiled meaningfully.\n\nBut now—a problem.\n\n*The invasion's early!*\n\nA full month ahead of prophecy. Grid's support would be delayed.\n\n*He said three weeks!*\n\nShe needed to act. Euphemina opened her whisper interface.\n\n—Grid!\n\n> [The target isn't connected.]\n\n\"What?\"\n\nGrid was always online except when sleeping. He should be awake now. Why wasn't he connected? Confusion rippled through her. She sent another whisper.\n\nSame result.\n\n*Did something happen?*\n\nDesperation clawed at her chest. Worry replaced resentment. As an Overgeared member, she respected Grid. Adored him, even.\n\n—Lauel!\n\nShe switched targets. Was he drowning in work again? The National Competition had just ended. Lauel's voice came through, drained.\n\n—Yes... Tell me, our hidden gem, Euphemina.\n\n—Send support to Siren—!\n\n*Lick.*\n\n\"Kyak!\"\n\nSomething rough, soft, and sticky dragged across Euphemina's cheek. She screamed at the uncomfortable sensation.\n\n\"Hihit! Yihihihit!\"\n\nA woman pressed her face close. Round eyes like a frog's. Bulging.\n\n\"You—did you just lick my cheek?\"\n\nEuphemina stared at the woman's long tongue, disbelief etched into her features.\n\n\"Hiit! Hihit! Soft!\"\n\n\"Disgusting.\"\n\nEuphemina's frown deepened. She cast immediately. The situation demanded action, not questions.\n\n\"Aqua Throne!\"\n\nThe spell belonged to 1st Prince Paong, a mage of exceptional talent. S-class magic. The strongest single-target attack available. But—\n\n\"Hiit! Yihihihit!\"\n\n*Peeng!*\n\nThe woman floated, smiling strangely. Black—the user's ID—faced Aqua Throne head-on and swung sharp claws at Euphemina.\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\nEuphemina was the first of two billion users to earn an Epic hidden class. Experience. Skill. Effort. All of it had culminated in this achievement. Since becoming a Duplicator, she'd witnessed countless high-ranker battles. She wasn't someone who allowed frontal attacks. She sidestepped. The situation required serious focus.\n\n*High resistance to water attribute? Armor or artifacts?*\n\nThe enemies had prepared thoroughly for this invasion.\n\n—Send assistance to Siren!\n\nShe whispered to Lauel again. A notification window appeared.\n\n> [You have failed to send a whisper!]\n>\n> [The 'Chaos Field' is blocking contact with the outside world!]\n\n\"Really prepared.\"\n\nEverything staged for a perfect surprise attack. Euphemina pulled a duplicated skill from her arsenal, eyes locked on the black pendant hanging between Black's curves.\n\n***\n\n\"Brother! Evil humans breached the outer wall! They're inside the city! Trampling our homes! Killing our people!\"\n\n3rd Prince Gulong's report ignited fury in 1st Prince Paong.\n\n\"This is because of that human! Euphemina!\"\n\nThat cursed woman had discovered Siren. Made it a target for greedy humans. Resentment burned in Paong's throat as he commanded the army.\n\n\"Take up your spears and orbs! Fight! Defend our kingdom! Our people! Drive back the enemy!\"\n\n\"Ohhhh!\"\n\nKing Maxong had locked himself away years ago, after losing the princess. Paong had to rally the troops. But war couldn't be won on enthusiasm alone. The human invaders were strong. Too strong. The soldiers couldn't match them.\n\nEspecially the white-haired woman. A ghost. Even Paong—skilled in both magic and spear—couldn't defeat her.\n\n\"The god of the waves abandoned us!\"\n\nWhy allow this invasion? Terrible screams echoed. Family and comrades died before their eyes—\n\n\"Lucky we were chosen as vanguard. Lauel's eye for talent is sharp. Even works well in the lord's absence.\"\n\n\"Stop talking and lie flat! The wyvern can't balance!\"\n\nPeak Sword gripped the saddle tighter.\n\n\"This is peak Vantner-level trolling.\" Regas muttered.\n\nFive riders clung to Huroi's wyvern, crossing the endless ocean. Huroi. Peak Sword. Pon. Regas. And Blood Warrior Katz.\n\n***\n\n\"This is exhausting.\"\n\nGrid hauled another box up the stairs. His phone sat in the corner of the old room, forgotten. The ringtone went unheard.\n\nIn the center of his new bedroom, the diamond capsule from Comet Group gleamed."
