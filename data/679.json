The item description didn't specify effective distance—he'd have to determine that himself.\n\nEighty-seven meters.\n\nThat was as far as the weapon's 'guaranteed hit' option extended. Beyond that threshold, the scope's magnification failed to resolve targets clearly, and accuracy plummeted. A warning window flashed whenever he aimed past that distance.\n\nGrid grimaced. Every Korean man who'd served his mandatory military service knew you could hit targets at two, even three hundred meters with a standard rifle. This scope was garbage by comparison.\n\nStill, he had to consider context. Satisfy's technological level remained firmly rooted in the Middle Ages. Firearms here weren't products of science or engineering—they were manifestations of magical craftsmanship developed by the dwarves. Even Pagma hadn't understood magic engineering until he'd trained under dwarf masters.\n\nAnd the dwarves themselves had never conceived of a sniper configuration. Why would they? The Hawk Eye skill already existed—a vision enhancement that broadened one's field of view and resolved distant targets with perfect clarity. Every sniper in Satisfy relied on it. The concept of an optical scope was essentially redundant.\n\nFrom that perspective, the fact that Pagma had even *created* a functioning scope marked a genuine innovation. Its poor performance was understandable.\n\n\"Well, whatever.\"\n\nYura was a Gunman. She'd have the necessary vision skills to unlock the weapon's full potential, sniping targets hundreds of meters out. That was the real reason Grid felt no attachment to this particular drop. Same logic applied to the Red Phoenix Bow—without Hawk Eye, he couldn't use either weapon to its fullest capacity.\n\nThe aiming time was too long anyway. Target had to be within one hundred meters for the instant-kill feature to reliably trigger. Better to pass it along to someone who could actually use it.\n\nGrid smiled as he imagined Yura behind the scope, her beautiful features set in deadly concentration. The mental image struck him as unexpectedly... charming.\n\n\"...Haah.\"\n\nHe shook the thought away. No point fantasizing about fruit hanging from branches he couldn't reach.\n\n*I'll only hurt myself if I start catching feelings.*\n\nAhyoung had left scars that still ached. Real-world relationships? Grid had no confidence there. When women at Chinese restaurants called his name and asked for autographs, he genuinely believed they were just fans. Pure enthusiasm, nothing more. How could they see him as anything else?\n\nThe dissonance was almost tragic—a celebrity with the potential to become one of the wealthiest men in the world, yet completely unable to recognize his own appeal.\n\nBut that trauma existed only in reality.\n\n*It's fine. I have Irene.*\n\nShe gave him love when he'd needed it most. Warm eyes. Gentle smile. How lonely would his life in Satisfy be without her?\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe thought of his wife softened his expression. His hands never stopped moving—scissors cutting fabric, needle and thread shaping the cloth into underwear. Sticks watched from across the room, visibly uncomfortable.\n\nA legendary blacksmith. A *king*. Sitting cross-legged on the floor, earnestly stitching undergarments.\n\nSomething about this picture felt profoundly wrong.\n\nGrid remained completely unselfconscious. He worked with single-minded focus.\n\n*Need to level this skill. Get production high enough to outfit the entire army.*\n\nThe Intermediate Underwear Production Method added defensive stats even to normal-rated items. Single-digit defense values—barely noticeable on an individual level. But across ten or twenty thousand soldiers? That negligible protection could mean the difference between life and death for dozens, maybe hundreds of troops.\n\n*Don't need to profit from this. Just grind the skill. I'll be the kingdom's underwear factory manager if that's what it takes.*\n\nHe crafted with the cheapest materials available—two silver coins per piece, give or take. Still, the math added up. Ten thousand soldiers meant significant gold expenditure, even at bulk rates.\n\nSticks finally spoke up. \"Your concern for the soldiers is admirable, but... won't this strain the kingdom's treasury?\"\n\nAs an academy principal and financial advisor—roles Lauel and Rabbit had specifically assigned him—Sticks felt obligated to raise the issue. Grid glanced up, his expression brightening.\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about that. I'm paying out of pocket.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nA king financing military equipment from personal funds? Sticks blinked in surprise. People in positions of power typically displayed the *opposite* tendency—extracting wealth from their subjects, not redistributing their own. For Grid to show such generosity...\n\n\"If I provide underwear now,\" Grid explained, \"the soldiers will appreciate it. Then they won't complain when I raise taxes later. Smart investment, right?\"\n\n\"...I see.\"\n\n*Humans truly are complex creatures.* Sticks felt a strange sense of enlightenment settle over him.\n\n[The principal of the Overgeared Academy, Sage Sticks's Intelligence has increased by 10.]\n\n[The principal of the Overgeared Academy, Sage Sticks has learned the skills 'Human Vigilance' and 'Caution.']\n\n\"????\"\n\nSticks bowed deeply. \"Thank you for the lesson.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nSomehow, Grid felt vaguely insulted.\n\n***\n\n\"Every time I log out, I'm reminded—these Comet Group diamond capsules are worth every penny.\"\n\nEven simple PC games stimulated the nervous system enough to make your mouse hand sweat. Virtual reality, with its complete sensory immersion, multiplied that intensity tenfold.\n\nYoungwoo climbed out of the capsule slick with perspiration. Without the capsule's climate control maintaining optimal conditions, he'd be drenched. The battle against Death Knight Alex had him riding a sustained adrenaline high. Already his mind raced ahead to the 63rd island—the next death knight guardian, the rewards waiting beyond.\n\nNo fear. Only burning determination to win without relying on the Immortality skill.\n\n\"Shower time.\"\n\nHe hummed tunelessly as he padded toward the bathroom, activating the flatscreen mounted on the marble wall. It defaulted to the Satisfy news channel.\n\n**『 Last week's report on the Saharan Empire rebellion continues to develop. Contrary to expert predictions, imperial forces have failed to suppress the uprising. 』**\n\nThe map on screen highlighted Lubana. The same location Lauel had mentioned.\n\n*Right there...*\n\nYoungwoo froze mid-lather, soap suds sliding down his torso.\n\n**『 Analysts attribute the rebels' success to a figure claiming descent from the Undefeated King Madra. 』**\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe Undefeated King Madra. The legendary hero who'd held Lubana against the empire at its height—a defensive genius who'd never lost a single battle. If his heir possessed even a fraction of that strength...\n\nYoungwoo's wariness spiked.\n\n**『 The key question remains: Is this descendant a player or an NPC? What impact will they have on the continent's balance of power? 』**\n\nNamed NPCs displayed intelligence rivaling or exceeding human players. Whether NPC or user, the Undefeated King's descendant was already reshaping continental politics. Their emergence had given both the Overgeared Kingdom and Valhalla breathing room, forcing the empire to divert military resources.\n\n*Probably a player. Someone like me.*\n\nThough an NPC remained possible. Too early to tell.\n\n*Either way... this is good news.*\n\nAccording to Ares, the gap between the empire's top-ranked knights was staggering. The Fifth Knight operated at the current skill ceiling—marginally above Kraugel and Grid. The Fourth Knight was exponentially stronger. The Third Knight beyond that. And the one considered absolute...\n\n*The First Knight.*\n\nMercedes. He'd met her before—a young woman whose name evoked luxury foreign cars, and whose combat prowess had felt like an insurmountable wall. Her army had crushed Ares's forces. Now that same army was losing to the Undefeated King's heir.\n\n*Could it really be an NPC?*\n\nIf the descendant was a player, they shouldn't be strong enough yet to resist the empire. Newly ascended Legends started at relatively low levels. Unless...\n\n*Wait.*\n\nHe'd assumed \"newly ascended.\" Why? His own revelation as a Legend had been delayed months after the fact. So had Kraugel's. Both had hidden their status until circumstances forced disclosure—Grid during the Yatan Servant raids, Kraugel during the great demon encounter.\n\n*Could a low-level player actually stop an imperial army? If this descendant is a player... they might've achieved legendary status a long time ago.*\n\n*Shhhhhhhh—*\n\nWater cascaded over him. Youngwoo smiled despite the anxiety coiling in his chest.\n\n*NPC or player—doesn't matter. Either way, it's exciting.*\n\nNo room to relax. Satisfy constantly dangled new threats, new challenges, new mysteries. The uncertainty gnawed at him. The anticipation thrilled him.\n\nSoon, he'd step onto the 63rd island.\n\nWhatever came next, he'd face it head-on."
