Shattered stone. Upturned soil. The traces left behind painted a picture of violence that made Grid reassess everything he thought he knew about the man called Kraugel.\n\n*He competed against Piaro. Against a legend.*\n\nDuring their last confrontation, Grid had managed to deplete half of Piaro's health. An impressive feat by any measure. But now?\n\n*I'd be lucky to chip away a quarter.*\n\nPiaro had grown. The spar with Grid had awakened something in the former knight. His farming techniques had evolved into weapons of devastating efficiency. Stats had increased. Skills had sharpened to a razor's edge. Even his level had climbed higher.\n\nAnd Kraugel had matched him.\n\n*Even though he's just a normal class...*\n\nGrid's hands clenched into fists. His knuckles cracked. Something hot and uncomfortable coiled in his chest, part admiration and part something darker.\n\nKraugel mistook the silence for anger. He bowed his head slightly. \"My first impression is terrible. I apologize that Reidan suffered damage because of my personal greed. I will compensate you as much as possible.\"\n\nThe words were sincere. Technically, Piaro had caused the destruction, but Kraugel's sense of responsibility ran deep. He had requested the spar. Therefore, the fault was his.\n\nGrid's response came out sharper than intended. \"Yes, a very gracious answer from the number one ranked player.\" He gestured broadly at the devastation. \"Do you have enough money for this?\"\n\nThe earthquake from their battle had shaken all of Reidan. The smithy alone had sustained significant losses. Equipment damaged. Materials scattered. Profit margins destroyed.\n\n\"Can one person reimburse this? As someone close to Piaro, shouldn't you share responsibility?\"\n\n\"M-My Lord.\" Piaro's voice carried a note of confusion.\n\n*Why is he so upset?*\n\nThe farmer couldn't decipher Grid's mood. But Asmophel, standing silently nearby, read the truth in his lord's eyes immediately.\n\n*Envy. Jealousy.*\n\nAsmophel had lived his entire life as a second son. He knew these emotions intimately. Grid was displaying them now, directed squarely at Kraugel. Emotions that neither Piaro nor Kraugel, both accustomed to being the best, could ever truly understand.\n\nGrid's expression hardened. \"Don't worry about reimbursement. Instead...\"\n\nA shimmer of blue-white light materialized in his left hand. <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Failure</span>, the shark-shaped greatsword. In his right hand appeared the darker blade of Grid's Greatsword. Both weapons hummed with latent power.\n\n\"Fight me.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nKraugel blinked. The request made no sense. This was Grid's city. His domain. Everything here, including Piaro, belonged to Grid. A death in this place would carry severe penalties.\n\n*Is he trying to drive me out?*\n\nThe thought flickered through Kraugel's mind. Was this about territory? About power plays and politics?\n\nGrid noticed the hesitation. He leveled <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Failure</span> at Kraugel's chest. \"Don't overthink it. I'm proposing a fair one-on-one duel.\"\n\n*A duel?*\n\nThat changed things. Grid was also a legend. A golden opportunity to fulfill the 'Sword Saint' quest had just fallen into Kraugel's lap. But something about it felt wrong. Using a complete stranger to clear his personal quest? His pride recoiled at the idea.\n\n\"Why do you want to fight me?\" Kraugel's words came clipped, direct. Grid hadn't shown him courtesy. No need to be polite in return.\n\nGrid's jaw tightened. \"You're called the top. The sky above the sky.\" His eyes glittered with challenge. \"I want to see if you're really as great as people say.\"\n\n\"Do you have the qualifications to judge my skills?\"\n\n\"You'll find out soon enough.\"\n\nThe sparring application appeared in Kraugel's interface. Grid had sent it despite the massive penalty Kraugel would face if he died in Reidan. The gesture demonstrated commitment. This wasn't a political maneuver. This was personal.\n\nGrid turned his head. \"Sehee... No, Ruby. Heal him.\"\n\nRuby's expression tightened. \"Are you really going to fight?\"\n\nShe'd seen Kraugel in action. The speed. The precision. The casual way he'd matched Piaro blow for blow. Worry gnawed at her, but she couldn't bring herself to voice it directly. Instead, her tone came out sharp and accusatory.\n\nGrid met her eyes. \"Hurry.\"\n\n\"...Be careful.\"\n\nRuby read the determination in her brother's face and relented. She raised her hand. \"**Hope.**\"\n\n> [The skill 'Hope' has been activated.]\n> [Target's health will recover by 10~30%.]\n\nGreen light washed over Kraugel. His health bar climbed steadily. He watched the effect with appreciation.\n\n*A Saintess.*\n\nGrid's sister. Kraugel found himself wondering about the man before him.\n\n*Territory. Family. Subordinates. Colleagues. Friends.*\n\nWas it fulfilling, being tied to one place with the same group of people? Did they really need to replicate the constraints of reality inside a game? Satisfy's world stretched endlessly in all directions. It would take a lifetime to explore even a fraction of it. Wasn't the point to travel alone, unbound, experiencing everything faster than anyone else?\n\nRuby used **Hope** three more times. Kraugel's health reached maximum. He came to a decision and shared his quest information with Grid.\n\n> **[Sword Saint]**\n> Difficulty: SSS\n> Objective: Win against a legend.\n\n\"This confrontation with you might help me.\" Kraugel's voice was neutral. \"Is that still acceptable?\"\n\nGrid froze.\n\n*Sword Saint.*\n\nThe strongest legendary class. Could he really give that to another player? The old Grid would have canceled the duel immediately. But he'd changed. He was Overgeared's leader now. A lord. A father. People watched him. Especially Lord, his son, who stood among the spectators with wide, curious eyes.\n\n*What would Lauel do?*\n\nGrid turned the question over in his mind for three seconds. Then his expression cleared.\n\n\"It's actually better if you become a Sword Saint because of me.\" He smiled, cold and calculating. \"The first ranked player owing me a favor? You'll pay it back eventually.\"\n\nThe framing was perfect. Kraugel would owe him, despite Grid being the one to propose the fight.\n\nGrid's smile widened. \"And I don't think I'll lose.\"\n\nThe statement carried absolute conviction. No room for doubt.\n\nKraugel responded with brutal honesty. \"Grid, I've seen your capabilities many times on broadcast. That's why I know.\" He paused. \"You can never beat me.\"\n\n\"Stop talking.\"\n\nThe memory surfaced unbidden. Elfin Stone's raid. Huroi's sacrifice. Grid's powerlessness in that moment had burned itself into his psyche.\n\n*Never again. I'll never feel that helpless again.*\n\nHis dream crystallized in his mind, sharp and clear.\n\n*I'll be the best. I'll be the best and never sacrifice my colleagues again.*\n\nFanciful? Maybe. But it was his dream nonetheless.\n\n*I'll test it through you.*\n\nGrid began walking forward. Each step looked ordinary, casual. But his footwork followed the patterns of Pagma's Swordsmanship, hidden within the natural gait. Two years of real time since Satisfy's launch, and he was finally implementing the basics properly.\n\nKraugel saw through it instantly. His eyes were too sharp, his insight too keen, to miss such details.\n\n\"**Kill.**\"\n\nKraugel sidestepped the legendary skill and drove forward with his counter.\n\n\"**Mole Ascension.**\"\n\n\"**Revolve.**\"\n\nPagma's Swordsmanship typically required five steps to activate. Grid had practiced the motions for countless hours, gradually compressing the movements. The skill manifested faster than ever before, catching Kraugel mid-strike.\n\nThe vortex of energy absorbed Kraugel's attack and reflected it back with devastating force.\n\n> [You have suffered 17,500 damage.]\n\nKraugel's body jerked backward. His white armor provided less defense than most third advancement classes. He'd also removed his gloves to prevent further damage to already battered equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, Pagma's Descendant was a legendary class designed for ultimate attack power. Grid wore the best items available. A quarter of Kraugel's health vanished in a single exchange.\n\nTitle effects and defense had saved him from a critical hit. But that wasn't what occupied Kraugel's thoughts.\n\n*I was wounded. By a user.*\n\nOnly three players had ever touched him in combat. Agnus, the king of the dead. And the infamous 'duo' from Blood Carnival. No one else.\n\nKraugel's eyes darkened. The recognition settled into his bones.\n\n*He's strong.*\n\n\"**White Light Steps.**\"\n\nUnder the brilliant sun, Kraugel's form blurred and vanished from Grid's field of view.\n\n*Stealth?*\n\nGrid's eyes swept the area. He evaluated his options and yanked out Kenen's Belt.\n\nA cloud of smoke erupted, obscuring Grid's position. But Kraugel remained calm. He'd already seen Grid's outline through the smoke. He arrested his attack mid-swing.\n\n*He's gone?*\n\nConfusion flickered across Kraugel's face. Then **Keen Senses** screamed a warning. Danger. From behind.\n\nGrid's voice came from empty air. \"If you use stealth, I'll become invisible.\"\n\nHe materialized, wearing the white hooded zip-up. His greatsword swept down in a vertical arc. **Pagma's Swordsmanship, Pinnacle.**\n\n*An invisibility cloak. Impressive.*\n\nKraugel almost laughed. Grid used legendary items like they were common equipment. He rotated smoothly and brought <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">White Fang</span> up to meet the attack. **Tearing the Sky**, a counterattack whose trajectory could only ascend, clashed with Grid's descending strike.\n\nThe sound of impact echoed like a thunderclap.\n\n> [You have suffered 21,050 damage.]\n\n\"Kuhk!\"\n\nGrid's health bar plummeted. Kraugel pressed the advantage immediately. <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">White Fang</span> became a blur of motion, seizing total momentum.\n\n*This trajectory...!*\n\nGrid wore the Slaughterer's Eye Patch. His insight was phenomenal. Combined with the item's effects, he could predict most enemy attack patterns. But Kraugel's swordsmanship contained depths that exceeded even Piaro's techniques.\n\n> [You have suffered 3,500 damage.]\n> [You have suffered 3,610 damage.]\n> [You have suffered 3,485 damage.]\n\nWounds accumulated on Grid's body. He attempted to counter with **Link**, but Kraugel anticipated every move. Dodged or blocked everything. Non-targeted skills were essentially useless against Kraugel's control.\n\nGrid summoned the God Hands.\n\nFour golden constructs materialized. Grid pointed. \"**Magic Missile!**\"\n\nBrilliant light erupted from four directions simultaneously, converging on Kraugel. Grid handed Grid's Greatsword, <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Failure</span>, and the Doppelganger's Greatsword to three of the God Hands. He activated **Quick Movements** and summoned <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Iyarugt</span> while rushing forward.\n\n*[Over here!]*\n\nThe demon sword painted red lines in Grid's vision. The optimal path. He followed it instinctively, his blade streaking toward Kraugel.\n\nKraugel responded with minimal movement. He avoided the strike by centimeters and counterattacked in the same motion, driving <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">White Fang</span> into Grid's chest.\n\n> [Critical Hit!]\n> [You have dealt 8,300 damage to the target.]\n\n*His defense is ridiculous.*\n\nKraugel couldn't fathom what type of armor Grid was wearing. The numbers didn't make sense.\n\nGrid's thoughts ran parallel. *The defense isn't applying properly because he's only hitting vital spots.*\n\nEvery single strike found a weak point. Joints. Gaps in armor. Vulnerable angles. It was inhuman precision.\n\n\"**Pagma's Swordsmanship...**!\"\n\nEnergy gathered around Grid. Power surged outward like a rising tide. The precursor to **Wave**.\n\nIt never manifested.\n\nKraugel's blade struck Grid's legs. The sword dance shattered before completion.\n\n\"**Storm Sword.**\"\n\nGrid stumbled. <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">White Fang</span> erupted with concentrated wind energy. The attack hammered into Grid's chest. Blood sprayed from the wound as Kraugel leapt forward, preparing to link **Meteor Sword**.\n\nThe God Hands tried to intercept. Wishful thinking. Their **Sword Mastery** remained at beginner level. They couldn't threaten someone like Kraugel.\n\n\"**Meteor Sword.**\"\n\nKraugel shook off all four God Hands. His body became a falling star. The attack descended toward Grid's skull.\n\n**Blood Cry.**\n\n> [The skill 'Blood Cry' has been activated!]\n\nA sonic wave of pure force exploded outward. Kraugel's body shook violently. The tempest threw off his balance. He started falling.\n\nGrid's skin paled to white. Black demonic energy coiled around his body like living shadow. The transformation completed in an instant.\n\nHis speed multiplied. **Blacksmith's Rage** and **Blackening**, activated simultaneously. Grid's ultimate combination.\n\nThe blade moved faster than thought.\n\n<span class=\"rarity-unique\">Iyarugt</span> punched through Kraugel's guard and buried itself in his chest. Blood fountained upward like crimson rain.\n\n\"My Lord!\" Piaro's voice cracked with alarm.\n\nBut Kraugel had already adapted. Even in crisis, he found opportunity. His counter came without hesitation.\n\n<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">White Fang</span> lanced forward and pierced Grid's throat. The attack came from an impossible angle, too fast for even <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Iyarugt</span> to track. Grid couldn't trigger Doran's Ring's protective effect.\n\n*[How did he...?]*\n\n\"Ugh...! **Pagma's Swordsmanship**...!\"\n\nGrid's health, already depleted by Blackening's cost, plummeted toward zero. But he didn't retreat. His immortality passive would save him. He had five seconds of invulnerability once his health hit minimum.\n\n*Kraugel's attacks? I can tank them for five more seconds.*\n\nGrid made the calculation coldly. He activated **Restraint**, planning to chain it into **Link** for the killing blow. But Kraugel moved faster.\n\nHis skill activated first.\n\nThe powerful kicking effect of **Charging** lifted Grid off his feet and slammed him into the ground with bone-breaking force.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms:**\nOG: Glossary Link\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\n*Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
