  "content": "Six years had passed since Satisfy's launch—though officially, the game was only entering its fifth year. The discrepancy came from the closed beta, a six-month testing period known only to a select few. For those chosen testers, however, those early days held special meaning.\n\n[You have discovered the North End Cave!]\n\nSkunk's hands trembled as the next notification materialized.\n\n[West Continent Exploration: 100%]\n\n[You have successfully mapped every region of the West Continent!]\n\nNo one else had managed it. Not in six years. The 1st ranked explorer had just carved his name into history.\n\n[Achievement Unlocked: More Than Anyone Has Seen]\n\n[First Player Bonus: Complete West Continent Map acquired!]\n\n[Your 'Highest Grade Compass' has evolved into 'Compass of Truth'!]\n\n[New region map completion starts at 10%!]\n\n[Special Ability Unlocked: Seedling Network]\n\n-Plant one 'Seedling' per discovered region. Mature trees grant vision and audio surveillance of their area. Destroyed seedlings cannot be replaced.\n\n[★ A legend rises! ★]\n\n[All experience gains and quest acquisition rates increased by 80% for 10 days!]\n\n\"Ah...\" A sound escaped Skunk's throat—half laugh, half sob. Tears welled in his weathered eyes. Years of wandering. Months of painstaking cartography. It had all led to this moment.\n\n\"Congratulations.\" Dog Woman pressed a handkerchief into his palm. \"Makes up for that disaster at the Sword Grave, doesn't it?\"\n\nSkunk wiped his eyes, managing a smile. \"I wouldn't call that a loss. We gained invaluable experience, accumulated knowledge, and earned Grid's goodwill.\"\n\n\"Does Grid actually like us, though?\" Dog Woman tilted her head. \"Combat classes already mock explorers. And Grid's both a crafter *and* a frontline warrior. He might wonder why we can't pull our weight in a fight.\"\n\n\"I think you're wrong.\" Skunk folded the handkerchief carefully. \"Grid's a production class himself. He understands our position better than most. Have you heard how Overgeared Kingdom treats its blacksmiths? They practically worship them.\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter either way.\" A third expedition member grinned. \"Who's going to mistreat the man with a Compass of Truth and legendary qualification? Every major player will be begging for your services. Grid included.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nIt was true. Skunk had just become the most valuable scout on the continent. Every hidden piece, every secret route, every dungeon location—all mapped in perfect detail. Guilds would fight for his allegiance. Kingdoms would offer fortunes.\n\nBut Skunk's expression remained distant.\n\n\"We'll see,\" he said quietly. \"I'm not sure I'd enjoy watching people's attitudes change overnight.\"\n\nHe hadn't logged into Satisfy to accumulate power. The mysteries hidden beyond the next horizon—that was what drove him. The money was just a pleasant bonus. Skunk loved his freedom. Joining a guild, serving a kingdom... it would cage him.\n\nNo. He had only one plan for the future.\n\nAnother expedition.\n\nSkunk opened his Complete Map. The West Continent spread before him in exquisite detail—every valley, every peak, every hidden grove rendered perfectly. But it wasn't complete. Not really. Beyond the western shores lay the Red Sea, vast and uncharted. And beyond that...\n\nThe East Continent.\n\nHe'd visited Pangea several times in the early days, back when the portal remained accessible. But something had changed. Last year, when he'd returned through the dimensional gate, he'd found Pangea abandoned—its streets empty, its gates sealed by Cho Kingdom soldiers who viewed westerners with open hostility.\n\nWhatever had happened on the East Continent, it had slammed the door shut.\n\n'The Red Sea it is, then.'\n\nSkunk's eyes brightened. His mind was already racing ahead, planning routes and supply lines.\n\n\"We're going to Galest.\"\n\n\"Galest?\" Dog Woman blinked. \"The Empire city? Right now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You do realize there's a war happening there? The Water Clan King is tearing the harbor apart.\"\n\nNamed NPCs like the Water Clan King were forces of nature. Skunk's group had encountered enough powerful beings across the continent to respect that kind of threat. Walking into an active battlefield was asking for trouble.\n\nBut Skunk shook his head firmly. \"The Saharan Empire doesn't lose wars on its own soil. The Water Clan King will be repelled or forced to retreat within days.\"\n\nGalest was the Empire's largest port, home to the continent's most advanced warships. State-of-the-art cannons. Reinforced hulls. Expert crews. If Skunk wanted to chart the Red Sea, he needed one of those vessels.\n\n\"We leave immediately.\"\n\n***\n\n\"No, the angle needs adjustment. Tilt it down another five degrees.\"\n\n\"Like this?\"\n\n\"Further... yes. Perfect.\"\n\nGrid wiped sweat from his forehead, studying the evolving blueprint spread across his workbench. This was the first collaborative design he'd attempted since forging the White Tiger Sword. The Overgeared Kingdom's finest blacksmiths crowded around him, each contributing expertise to the revolutionary weapon taking shape.\n\nA cannon. But not just any cannon.\n\nThis design incorporated wheels for mobility and a rear-loading mechanism that would revolutionize artillery warfare. The barrel could adjust from low-angle direct fire to high-angle bombardment. Crew-portable. Fast-firing. Flexible.\n\n\"The key advantage,\" one of the Eastern smiths explained enthusiastically, \"is that barrel length doesn't affect reload speed with this breech-loading system. We can maximize power, accuracy, and range by extending it.\"\n\n\"Then we should make it longer,\" another suggested.\n\n\"No good. Weight becomes prohibitive.\"\n\n\"What about black iron? Lighter than steel, same durability.\"\n\n\"Still too heavy at that length. We'd need to reinforce the carriage and add wheels. That's five crew members per gun instead of three.\"\n\n\"Blue orichalcum?\"\n\n\"Supply problems. And it's *too* light—the recoil would shake the whole assembly apart unless we add more reinforcement. Same wheel problem.\"\n\n\"So... this is the maximum practical barrel length?\"\n\n\"Afraid so.\"\n\nGrid listened carefully, sketching adjustments as the discussion flowed. His knowledge of metallurgy and materials helped him follow along, but the advanced engineering principles sailed over his head. Physics. Structural mechanics. Ballistics. These blacksmiths spoke a language he'd never studied.\n\nBut that was fine. He didn't need to understand everything.\n\nThe Legendary Blacksmith's Creation skill was generous that way. The system would translate confused concepts into concrete specifications, analyzing principles Grid couldn't grasp and rendering them as precise blueprints. It had worked when he'd created Failure. It would work now.\n\nExcept this time, he wasn't working alone. The collective expertise of master craftsmen combined with the system's analytical power... the result would be something extraordinary.\n\n\"We should protect the gun crew,\" Grid interjected during a lull. \"What about adding a shield plate above the breech?\"\n\nThe room fell silent.\n\n\"A... shield?\" One smith blinked. \"For the artillery crew?\"\n\n\"Arrows. Magic bolts. Thrown weapons.\" Grid tapped the blueprint. \"Our soldiers will be exposed while operating the cannon. A protective barrier here\"—he sketched quickly—\"would give them cover without significantly impeding operation.\"\n\n\"Brilliant!\" Panmir leaned forward, eyes gleaming. \"We were so focused on performance we forgot about survivability!\"\n\nThe design evolved. What had started as a simple barrel-between-wheels concept transformed into something more sophisticated. The protective shield Grid suggested gave the weapon a fortified, professional appearance—brutal efficiency wrapped in pragmatic defense. Yes, it added weight. But not enough to matter.\n\n'Better a heavier cannon than dead crews,' Grid thought. 'They're the ones hauling these things around anyway.'\n\n\"Magnificent,\" Panmir breathed, studying the shared blueprint. His expert eye could estimate performance even from incomplete designs. \"Compared to Imperial artillery... this will be faster, more accurate, and hit harder. The range alone...\"\n\n\"What are you naming it?\" another smith asked. \"This weapon will define Overgeared Kingdom's military for decades.\"\n\n\"Already decided.\"\n\nEvery eye turned to Grid. The smithy held its collective breath.\n\nGrid met their gazes with perfect solemnity. \"The Overgeared Cannon.\"\n\n\"...\" Panmir's expression went carefully blank. Not because the name was bad—though it certainly wasn't inspired. He'd just realized that as an Overgeared Guild member living in the Overgeared Kingdom, the title 'Overgeared Cannon' sounded completely normal to his ears now.\n\nHe'd been conditioned. They all had.\n\n\"It's a bit... plain,\" Panmir managed.\n\n\"Really? Should I call it the Super Ultra Overgeared Cannon?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not.\" Panmir's face hardened with genuine alarm. Some things were sacred. \"Overgeared Cannon is fine. Perfect, even.\"\n\nGrid grinned, satisfied.\n\n***\n\nEvening shadows stretched across the smithy when Grid finally straightened, rolling tension from his shoulders.\n\n\"That's it. We're done.\"\n\n\"Check and double-check,\" Panmir confirmed, reviewing the calculations one final time. \"Perfect.\"\n\nThe blueprint had transformed throughout the day. Where blank parchment had existed that morning, now a detailed schematic depicted every angle of the revolutionary artillery piece. Technical formulas crowded the margins. Material specifications. Stress calculations. The accumulated expertise of master craftsmen crystallized into elegant lines and precise measurements.\n\n\"Good.\" Grid's finger hovered over the confirmation button. \"Here we go.\"\n\nHe pressed.\n\n[Item Creation: Complete]\n\n[A masterpiece forged through collaboration between legendary blacksmith and master craftsmen!]\n\n[Item quality increased by one grade!]\n\nGrid's breath caught as the notification expanded.\n\n[Design: Overgeared Cannon]\n\n[Rating: Unique ~ Legend]\n\n\"What—\"\n\nThey'd deliberately designed for mass production. Standardized components. Common materials. Simple assembly procedures. Grid had estimated the cannon would rate anywhere from Rare to Epic—maybe low Legendary if luck smiled on them.\n\nA guaranteed Unique floor? With Legendary ceiling potential?\n\n\"YES!\" Grid's shout rattled the smithy windows.\n\n\"Congratulations, Your Majesty!\" The blacksmiths surged forward.\n\nAge and dignity forgotten, the half-naked craftsmen grabbed each other in fierce embraces, laughing and shouting. In their minds' eyes, they could already see it—ranks of Overgeared Cannons lined along fortress walls, their barrels gleaming in the sun. Victory after victory. Enemies fleeing before unstoppable bombardments.\n\nThe future shone bright indeed."
