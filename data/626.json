  "content": "# XX District, Seoul Outskirts\n\nSeven months ago, XX District had been little more than a rural neighborhood—simple facilities, farming fields, and the quiet rhythm of village life. Then Overgeared King Grid erected the ten-billion-won Youngwoo Building, and everything changed.\n\nThe pilgrims came first. *If we go there, we might see Grid!* Within weeks, the trickle became a flood. Merchants sprang up to service the tourists, and what had been farmland transformed into a bustling commercial district—the most prosperous area in the entire city.\n\nSome residents had even petitioned to rename the entire district after Grid.\n\n***\n\nThe Youngwoo Building stood ten stories tall, its façade gleaming with expensive materials shaped by a world-renowned architect. Every line of its construction justified that astronomical price tag.\n\nToday, a crowd of Chinese tourists clustered before the entrance, cigarette butts and spittle marking their passage through the district.\n\n\"This is Grid's building!\"\n\n\"I want to see the penthouse!\"\n\n\"Come on, we came all this way. Let's look around inside.\"\n\nThe merchants nearby exchanged uneasy glances.\n\n\"They're going to try to enter...\"\n\n\"I've heard the stories. Not all Chinese tourists are like this, but enough of them ignore basic courtesy. They'll walk right past the 'No Entry' signs.\"\n\n\"What if they interfere with Youngwoo-ssi's gaming?\"\n\nFor the people of XX District, Shin Youngwoo was nothing less than a savior. He'd transformed their sleepy neighborhood into a thriving hub. They owed him everything.\n\nSeveral merchants approached the tourists, hands raised placatingly. \"Excuse me, friends. This building is primarily an officetel—only the first-floor cafes and restaurants are open to the public.\"\n\n\"Please don't block the elevator entrance. The residents need access.\"\n\nThe tourists' expressions darkened. \"What are these Koreans saying?\"\n\n\"They're telling us we can't enter?\"\n\n\"Who the hell do they think they are?\"\n\nHostile stares bore into the merchants, who instinctively stepped back. There were too many tourists, their posture too aggressive. No point picking a fight with people who clearly didn't care about basic courtesy.\n\nThen—\n\n\"What's going on here?\"\n\nA girl in a school uniform emerged from the crowd. Porcelain skin, delicate features, the proportions of a runway model. Shin Sehee, Grid's younger sister.\n\n\"Ruby!\"\n\n\"Saintess Ruby!\"\n\n\"She looks exactly like in the game!\"\n\n\"It's Korea's Jewel!\"\n\nThe tourists surged forward like a breaking wave, surrounding the fragile girl in seconds.\n\n\"Signature!\"\n\n\"Photo!\"\n\n\"Shake hands! No—hug!\"\n\nNearly fifty bodies pressed in around Sehee. The merchants tried to intervene, but the crowd simply swept them aside.\n\n\"S-Sehee!\" one merchant cried helplessly.\n\nA Chinese man grabbed Sehee's arm, pulling her close—\n\n\"Kyaaak!\"\n\n*Screeeech.*\n\nA limousine—sleek, black, impossibly long—glided to a stop beside the crowd. Over ten meters of luxury that belonged on a movie screen, not a Seoul side street.\n\nThe tourists fell silent, staring.\n\nThe rear door opened.\n\nA man stepped out, his expression carved from ice. The killing intent radiating from him hit like a physical force, a blade pressed to every throat simultaneously.\n\n\"我快疯了。\" *I'm going mad.*\n\nThe tourists' faces went white. \"H-Hao...!\"\n\nHao—the Miracle of the Continent. China's greatest ranker. What was he doing in South Korea?\n\nHe positioned himself between Sehee and the crowd, his voice dropping to a dangerous register. \"Making a spectacle in a foreign country... Do you have any idea how your behavior reflects on the rest of us? Leave now, before I contact the embassy and have you removed.\"\n\nThe threat hung in the air. Everyone knew Hao's reach extended to the highest levels of the Chinese government. Rumor had it even the president was a fan.\n\nThe tourists scattered.\n\nWithin the hour, Chinese news outlets would run stories about the incident, sparking a national conversation about tourist behavior abroad. The noisy crowd in front of Youngwoo Building simply... evaporated.\n\nHao's expression softened as he turned to Sehee. \"Are you all right, Miss Ruby?\" His Korean was awkward but earnest.\n\nSehee nodded, wide-eyed and shaken—like a startled squirrel. \"Thanks to you.\"\n\n\"I'm relieved.\" Something in Hao's gaze lingered. He'd met countless beautiful women in China, but Sehee's delicate beauty was... rare. Special.\n\nSehee, for her part, found his protectiveness reminiscent of her brother. She relaxed. \"What brings you to South Korea?\"\n\n\"I need to speak with Grid. About Kraugel.\"\n\n\"Kraugel...\" Sehee's cheeks colored faintly. The Sky Above the Sky—the man who'd fought her brother to a standstill twice. She remembered his desperate determination to save his mother, and something in her chest tightened. Like most women, she couldn't help but be drawn to that kind of intense, focused charisma.\n\n\"Is Grid home?\" Hao asked.\n\n\"Yes. Did you schedule an appointment?\"\n\n\"I did. But I arrived an hour and fifteen minutes early.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Sehee's smile turned sympathetic. \"You'll have to wait until the scheduled time, then. My brother lives by a strict timetable. He won't log out until the appointed hour even if you put a knife to his throat. He has a lot to manage now that he's a king.\"\n\n\"I... see.\"\n\n\"When the mayor visited last month, he had to wait three hours.\"\n\nHao glanced toward the café. \"Is the coffee here good?\"\n\n\"I'm still in school, so I don't drink coffee. But the sweet potato latte is excellent.\"\n\n\"Then... I'll wait with a sweet potato latte.\"\n\nGrid was one of the busiest people in the world now. Hao understood. Some of his precious time today would simply have to be sacrificed.\n\n***\n\n# Earl Bruno's Mansion\n\nThe mansion dominated Frontier's skyline—second only to Duke Steim's own castle in size and grandeur. Grid took in the imposing façade and nodded to himself.\n\n*Father-in-law's right-hand man lives well.*\n\nEarl Bruno was supposed to be one of Duke Steim's most trusted advisors, a pillar of the Overgeared Kingdom's northern holdings. Grid had high hopes for their meeting. Bruno would know where to find Fatima.\n\n\"Halt!\"\n\nGuards materialized at the gate, spears leveled. Grid approached without fur clothing despite the bitter cold, and their eyes narrowed with suspicion.\n\n*Doesn't he feel the cold?*\n\n*Could be a humanoid monster...*\n\nGrid examined the guards' weapons with approval. Well-maintained. Sharp. \n\n*The northern soldiers really are superior.*\n\nThis region crawled with dangerous monsters. Duke Steim had clearly invested heavily in training and equipping his forces. They'd be a valuable asset to the Overgeared Kingdom.\n\n\"Identify yourself.\"\n\nGrid's face remained hidden beneath his wide-brimmed hat. Rather than answering immediately, he studied them—these well-trained soldiers who'd be under his command. Then he smiled.\n\nThe guards tensed.\n\n*What the—*\n\nGrid realized he was frightening them and removed his hat. Black hair spilled free, catching the moonlight.\n\n\"...King Grid?\"\n\nThe color drained from their faces. Their master's target—the very man Earl Bruno plotted against—standing here at the front gate.\n\n\"Open it,\" Grid said simply.\n\n\"Y-Yes, Your Majesty!\"\n\nA king's word was law in his own territory. The guards scrambled to obey.\n\n***\n\n# The Torture Chamber\n\nBeneath Earl Bruno's mansion, in a room that reeked of blood and despair:\n\n\"Ugh... s-stop... please stop...\"\n\nDays had blurred together. Fatima had lost count of how long he'd been down here—how many times the whip had fallen, how many hours he'd hung from the chains. His mental strength, once his pride, had finally shattered.\n\nThe pain had to end. He'd surrender anything to make it stop.\n\nEarl Bruno's smile widened. \"Finally ready to share your underwear production method?\"\n\n\"I'll... I'll hand it over.\" Fatima's voice cracked. \"But you need to understand—it requires exceptional skill. Not just anyone can learn it.\"\n\n\"There are talented tailors across the continent, Sir Fatima. Don't flatter yourself.\"\n\n\"Kuoh...\"\n\nThe words cut deeper than any whip. Fatima was Frontier's premier tailor—one of the finest in the entire Overgeared Kingdom. His pride in his craft was everything. And Earl Bruno had just crushed it beneath his heel like an insect.\n\nThe psychological wound dwarfed any physical torment.\n\n\"Still defiant?\" Earl Bruno raised the whip again. \"Haven't learned your lesson?\"\n\n\"E-Earl Bruno!\"\n\nThe basement door burst open. The butler stumbled in, white-faced and gasping.\n\n\"What's this about?\" Earl Bruno snapped. \"Don't tell me Grid showed up at my house.\"\n\n\"T-That's exactly it!\"\n\n\"Haha. Funny joke.\"\n\n\"I'm serious! King Grid is here!\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nIce flooded Earl Bruno's veins.\n\n*He knows. Grid discovered I'm leading the Anti-Grid Alliance, and he's come to eliminate me.*\n\nThe intelligence network required to uncover that so quickly... Earl Bruno had always known Grid was formidable, but this exceeded even his estimates.\n\n*This is why he's a king. His capabilities far surpass my understanding.*\n\nEarl Bruno's jaw clenched. He'd been caught faster than he'd thought possible.\n\n\"Gather the entire army.\" His voice was stone. \"If I'm going to die today, Grid dies with me.\"\n\nHe stalked from the basement, leaving Fatima alone in the darkness.\n\nFatima sagged in his chains, something warm blooming in his chest despite the pain.\n\n*The king came... to rescue me?*\n\nHe'd never even met Grid. Yet here was his liege, walking into obvious danger to save a mere tailor.\n\n*If I survive this day,* Fatima thought, *I'll serve him until my last breath.*"
