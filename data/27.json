Some actual progress.*\n\nHe shuffled to the kitchen, yanked open the refrigerator, and chugged water straight from the bottle. The icy liquid burned down his throat.\n\n*A hidden quest. An actual hidden quest.*\n\nHis hands shook as he set the bottle on the counter. Grid collapsed onto the sagging couch and stared at the ceiling, that same idiotic humming bubbling up from his chest. He couldn't stop grinning.\n\nA combat buff skill. Safe quest completion. A whole chain of linked quests opened up. And the levels—god, the levels. Just from killing a few thugs, he'd rocketed to Level 21.\n\n\"Jackpot.\" The word came out like a prayer. \"This is an actual jackpot.\"\n\nHis leg bounced against the couch. Among the billions crawling through Satisfy, hidden quests were unicorns. Phantoms. In his entire miserable year of play, Grid had never even *heard* of one dropping.\n\nEverything had shifted since he became Pagma's Descendant. The class was—\n\n*Legendary.*\n\n\"Years.\" He sat up, spreading his hands like a street preacher. \"Years of eating shit. It was all building to this. Divine compensation for my suffering!\"\n\nHe laughed. It echoed in the cramped apartment.\n\n*Khan's quest reward. What if it's a Unique item?*\n\nThe thought made his mouth water. Dainsleif and Valhalla—both reproductions, sure, but with performance rivaling his Failure design. The difference? Normal people could actually equip them. Which meant—\n\n\"Billionaire. I could actually become a billionaire.\"\n\nGrid paced the narrow strip between couch and TV. His reflection stared back from the black screen, gaunt and manic.\n\nAlbatino. A blacksmith who'd inspired Pagma himself. A master who'd never reached Legendary status, while Grid—a nobody, a *failure*—had stumbled ass-backwards into the class during a random quest.\n\n\"That's the world.\" He rubbed his face. *Luck isn't fair. Talent isn't fair. Nothing is fair.*\n\nBut right now? Right now, luck was *his*.\n\nGrid checked his watch. Two hours had bled away in the real world. Eight hours in Satisfy.\n\n*Khan should be awake.*\n\nThe doctor had blamed excessive drinking and stress for the old man's collapse. But the quest structure was obvious—once Khan overcame his alcoholism, his health would recover. Standard RPG logic.\n\n*No need to worry. Just collect the reward.*\n\nGrid climbed back into the capsule.\n\n\"Log in.\"\n\nDarkness swallowed his vision. When light returned, he was staring at water-stained ceiling tiles.\n\nThe clinic. He'd logged out in Khan's room.\n\nGrid found the doctor in the hallway, a middle-aged man with the placid smile of someone who dealt with death daily.\n\n\"The old man. What's his status?\"\n\nSimon's smile widened. \"I feared the worst—blood pressure that high in his condition? But God has blessed him. His recovery exceeded all expectations. He can be discharged soon.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Grid's shoulders dropped half an inch.\n\n\"Though he must abstain from alcohol. Completely.\"\n\nSimon led him to Khan's room. The blacksmith sat propped against thin pillows, and when he spotted Grid, his weathered face cracked into a genuine smile.\n\n\"Welcome. I owe you more than words can express.\"\n\nGrid waved a hand. \"People in tough spots should help each other. You can leave now. Just need to settle the treatment fee.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nKhan's smile didn't falter, but something flickered behind his eyes. The pause stretched like taffy.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I currently don't—\"\n\nLightning struck Grid's brain.\n\n*No.*\n\n\"Don't tell me.\" His voice came out strangled. \"You won't pay the bill?\"\n\n\"It's not that I won't.\" Khan's hands twisted the blanket. \"I can't. I don't have the money.\"\n\n\"Then what—credit? Does this place take credit?\" Grid whipped toward Simon.\n\nThe doctor's kind expression had evaporated. His face was now flat, professional. Cold.\n\n\"Credit isn't possible.\"\n\nGrid's eye twitched.\n\n*Leave him. Just leave this broke old man and forget the quest.*\n\nBut the reward. The linked quest. The potential Unique items.\n\n\"Goddammit!\" He slammed a fist against his thigh. \"My bad luck was just *waiting*! I knew it! This is karma!\"\n\nHe paid the one gold. Each coin felt like pulling teeth.\n\n*How much have I spent today? How much?*\n\nHe couldn't bring himself to calculate it.\n\n---\n\nKhan's smithy smelled like coal dust and old metal.\n\n\"Thank you.\" The blacksmith bowed—a full ninety-degree angle, back parallel to the floor. \"Thank you. From the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nGrid crossed his arms. *At least he has a conscience.*\n\n\"Because of you, I felt hope again.\" Khan's voice cracked. \"This smithy—seven generations of my family—I nearly lost it through my own weakness and ignorance. I don't know how to repay you.\"\n\nThe old man's shoulders shook. Tears cut tracks through the grime on his face.\n\n*Why do old people cry so much?*\n\nGrid stepped forward and grabbed Khan's calloused hand. It was the kind of dramatic gesture the hero made in dramas—the noble sacrificer who asked for nothing in return.\n\n*I'm not that person.*\n\n\"If you really appreciate it, give me something.\"\n\nKhan blinked.\n\nGrid squeezed his hand. \"I want a reward.\"\n\n\"Yes. Of course.\" Khan nodded vigorously. \"Your grace was immense. I just—I don't know what would be appropriate.\"\n\n*Is this old man stupid? Did he not hear what I just—*\n\nNo. Focus. Stay focused on the prize.\n\n\"Old man.\" Grid's voice dropped to something resembling sympathy. \"Those gangsters almost stole this place. If you keep drinking, your health will collapse. You'll die.\"\n\n\"That's... that's true.\"\n\n\"When you collapsed, you could've died. Didn't you live because I dragged you to that clinic and paid for your treatment?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I'm the savior of your life.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nGrid released his hand. \"To the savior of your life, you should give a treasure equivalent to your life.\"\n\nKhan's face crumpled. \"A treasure equivalent to my life? I don't have such a thing. What should I—\"\n\n\"Don't look so sad.\" Grid held up his hands. \"I'm a nice person. I don't want treasures equivalent to your life.\" He pointed to the second floor. \"Those up there—if you give me Dainsleif and Valhalla, that's enough of a reward.\"\n\nHis heart hammered against his ribs. The items were right there. *Right there.*\n\nKhan's expression went flat. \"They are heirlooms passed down through generations. Treasures that surpass the value of my life.\" He met Grid's eyes. \"I will give you my life, but not those items.\"\n\nGrid's face twitched.\n\n*Then why act so grateful, you stingy old—*\n\nKhan coughed into his fist. \"Let me explain. These treasures—my ancestor Albatino poured his soul into them. A descendant cannot simply hand away such works. I am bound to protect them until I die.\" He paused. \"But there is an exception.\"\n\n*Albatino's descendant?*\n\nGrid's mind raced. *If that's true, once he quits drinking, his blacksmithing should...*\n\n\"What exception?\"\n\nKhan's gaze sharpened. \"How were you able to use those treasures? And how did you recognize their value at a glance?\"\n\nThey climbed the stairs. The second floor was cramped, dominated by the display cases holding Dainsleif and Valhalla. Even covered in dust, the sword and armor radiated menace.\n\nKhan touched the glass. \"These are cursed battle gear. Their performance transcends imagination, but the usage requirements—\" He shook his head. \"It's been centuries since anyone could equip them. No hero has met the conditions. They vanished from history. Now, no one even knows they exist.\"\n\nGrid studied the items. *Except users. Users will know soon enough.*\n\n\"I've displayed them prominently for decades.\" Khan's voice carried the weight of frustration. \"I wanted the world to see Dainsleif and Valhalla. But to truly understand such masterworks, one needs insight equal to the creator's.\" He turned. \"Until you. You walked in and understood immediately.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes glittered.\n\n\"There is a legend in my family. About 130 years ago, a man named Pagma visited this smithy. He found Dainsleif and Valhalla gathering dust in a corner.\" Khan's voice dropped to a reverent whisper. \"He saw their value. Instantly.\"\n\nGrid leaned against the wall. *Go on.*\n\n\"Pagma admired them. He wore the armor, wielded the sword. My ancestor witnessed swordsmanship that seemed to pierce the sky itself—lightning crackled with each strike.\" Khan's hands trembled. \"The beauty was beyond belief. My ancestor fell to his knees and begged Pagma to take them. 'This is what Albatino would have wanted.'\"\n\n\"And?\" Grid's pulse quickened. \"Did Pagma agree?\"\n\n\"No.\" Khan gestured to the display. \"If he'd agreed, they wouldn't be here. Pagma refused. He said, 'These works are filled with Albatino's soul. I will not dishonor them by using them as a vessel for my inadequate self.'\"\n\nGrid's brow furrowed. *He refused free legendary items? Is he insane?*\n\n*Wait. Maybe Pagma was just rich. Not greedy for money.*\n\nThe thought was alien.\n\n\"Before Pagma left,\" Khan continued, \"he made a prophecy. 'There are currently no heroes worthy of this armor. But when the time comes, many heroes will emerge. All of them will be qualified to become its master.'\"\n\nThe pieces clicked.\n\n*Many heroes. He meant users.*\n\nGrid straightened. Users leveled fast. The growth was infinite. Eventually, dozens of rankers would meet those ridiculous requirements.\n\n*I need to claim these before that happens.*\n\n\"Why the long story?\" Grid asked.\n\nKhan stepped closer. \"I want to know your identity.\"\n\n\"You think I'm one of the heroes Pagma mentioned?\"\n\n\"Correct. I told you there was an exception.\" Khan's eyes burned with intensity. \"If you can prove you are the hero Pagma prophesied—I will give you Dainsleif and Valhalla.\"\n\nGrid stared at the old blacksmith. At the desperate hope etched into every line of his face.\n\n*A linked quest. An ancient one.*\n\nSomething cold slithered down Grid's spine. This wasn't just about loot anymore.\n\nThis was about a legend recognizing another legend.\n\n---\n\n**[Author's Note]**\n*16 chapters a week will start next week (basically tomorrow) because of too many mass releases this week.
