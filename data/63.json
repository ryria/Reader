The sword was worth it.\n\nIrene lifted the blade from its case. \"Sir Phoenix. Take this sword and crush the Yatan Church.\"\n\nPhoenix dropped to one knee. The sword passed from Irene's hands to his, the weight settling across his palms.\n\n\"For the north. For Earl Steim.\" Phoenix met her eyes. \"I will return victorious.\"\n\nHe equipped the weapon.\n\n> **[Sword of Self-transcendence]**  \n> Rating: <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Legendary</span>  \n> Durability: 365/365 | Attack Power: 356  \n> Attack Speed: +6% | Accuracy: +10%  \n> Attack and Defense Rate: +10%  \n>  \n> * Adds +200 damage per strike.  \n> * Generates skill: 'Perfect State of Self-transcendence'  \n>  \n> *A sword forged by a craftsman possessing immense skill and potential, yet lacking experience and renown.

Bring me the head of a Servant.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lady!\"\n\nPhoenix marched out with twelve knights and fifteen hundred soldiers. Their destination: the Yatan Temple perched in the cliffs. The enemy numbered only one hundred fifty. But no one grew complacent. Every believer in that temple was at minimum level 160. The soldiers? Barely level 50.\n\nIndividual skill meant everything. And one of the Seven Servants waited at the summit. Numbers and tactics would decide this.\n\nPhoenix spotted the temple on the distant cliff. He twisted in his saddle, voice booming across the ranks.\n\n\"Do not falter! I stand at your vanguard!\" He raised the legendary blade. \"Phoenix, strongest knight of the north! I will take the Seventh Servant's head. Follow me, and victory is ours!\"\n\n\"OHHHHHH!\"\n\nThe roar shook the earth. The sound carried all the way to the temple.\n\n---\n\n\"The pagans approach!\" A believer's voice cracked with panic. \"They dare defile this sacred ground!\"\n\nYura stood on the temple's edge, the cliff dropping away beneath her heels. Earl Steim's banner fluttered in the distance, leading a tide of steel. She glanced back at the temple head.\n\n\"Take the high ground. Focus magic downward. Watch for archers.\"\n\n\"What about you?\"\n\nThe man's worry was obvious. Yura's expression went cold.\n\n\"I'll meet them on the ground. Slow their advance.\"\n\nShe knew the truth. The Yatan Church was evil. Every malicious quest had piled doubt on her conscience. The Seven Servants were monsters deserving only hatred.\n\nBut she'd made her choice. This was Satisfy. Not reality. Unless she obtained a hidden class like Agnus or Katz, there was no turning back. Abandoning her ranker position wasn't an option.\n\nThe title 'Blood Witch' had taught her to endure stigma. Another slaughter changed nothing.\n\n*Taack!*\n\nYura launched herself from the cliff. She landed in front of the army, light as a falling leaf.\n\nPhoenix reined his horse to a halt. \"Sharp energy flows from you! You're one of the Seven Servants!\" His sword pointed at her. \"Today, your infamous deeds end!\"\n\nHe was wrong. Yura wasn't one of the Seven Servants, merely a candidate for the Eighth. Against Phoenix and his army, fear should have paralyzed her.\n\nBut retreat wasn't an option. One hundred forty-three believers were isolated here. She had to save them all to clear her quest. Only then would she ascend to become the Eighth Servant.\n\nShe began the chant. \"Great god of darkness, your humble servant calls. Fill this place with shadow. Plant fear in our enemies' hearts. Show your power to those who worship you.\"\n\nDarkness swallowed the sun. Despite the hour, night consumed the valley. Fifteen hundred men screamed in confusion.\n\nYura smiled.\n\n\"Dark Storm!\"\n\n***KWAAAAANG!***\n\nThe maelstrom of shadow descended. It devoured the army whole. Yura began her next incantation, confident that at least a quarter of them were dead or dying.\n\nThen she froze.\n\n*What?*\n\nPhoenix burst from the storm. His armor bore scorch marks, but he charged directly at her. Yura's hands moved on instinct.\n\n\"Diamond Barrier!\"\n\n***KAAAANG!***\n\nPhoenix's strike slammed into the wall. Brilliant sparks scattered across the translucent surface. This was Diamond Barrier, the spell with overwhelming defense against physical attacks.\n\nPhoenix's voice thundered from beyond the wall. \"Don't even think of touching my soldiers! Your opponent is me!\" His eyes blazed. \"Perfect State of Self-transcendence!\"\n\n***KUWAAAANG!***\n\nPurple energy erupted from his body.\n\n*Kkikikikik!*\n\nYura's eyes widened. Cracks spiderwebbed across Diamond Barrier. Impossible. This spell could withstand boss-level physical strikes. A mere knight couldn't—\n\n*Jjeok.*\n\nDiamond Barrier split in half.\n\nPhoenix walked through the shattered magic, his face expressionless as a statue.\n\n\"Hell!\"\n\nYura cast the single-target fear spell. Black powder engulfed Phoenix's form. He should crumble, defenseless before terror.\n\nHe didn't stop.\n\nPhoenix swung without hesitation. His doubled stats and abnormal condition immunity drove Yura into a corner.\n\nShe stared at him, recognition flashing through her mind.\n\n*Grid...?*\n\nThe irony cut deeper than Phoenix's blade. She'd interfered with Grid's S-grade quest in the past, caused him to fail. Now a sword Grid forged was destroying her own quest.\n\n*Seokeok!*\n\nPain lanced through her side. Yura groaned, but completed the spell she'd prepared before Diamond Barrier fell.\n\n\"Darkness.\"\n\nSeventeen days ago, Yura had reached 100,000 faith. God Yatan's voice had whispered in her ears.\n\n*'I will grant you new power if you pray.'*\n\nShe'd prayed. She'd asked for strength to fight those resistant to black magic. Power developed from her experience facing Grid. That power activated now.\n\n---\n\nI liquidated everything. Mamon's Greatsword. Mengel's Plate Armor. Every item in my warehouse went to auction. The final tally: 240,023 gold.\n\nI registered 220,000 gold on the item trading site and converted it to cash.\n\nThe transaction fee hit me in the gut. Five percent. *Five percent!* \n\nThat was 13.2 million won vanishing into the site's coffers. Money I'd earned through blood and sweat. Gone. Just like that. Because someone somewhere decided they deserved a cut for... what? Hosting a website?\n\nI shook my head. \"There are so many ways to profit off people.\"\n\n*If I'd been smarter, I could've lived like that.*\n\nI paid Mother's Heart is Happy Financial Services their 10 million won. The remaining 240,800,000 won went into a bankbook, which I handed to my father.\n\nMy parents stared at the numbers. Their faces went blank.\n\nMother turned the book over in her hands. \"Is this... a fake account?\"\n\nFather's eyes narrowed. \"Did you do something illegal?\"\n\nSehee grabbed my arm. \"Did you sell your organs? Lift your shirt. I need to check for surgery marks.\"\n\nHeat crawled up my neck. They didn't believe me. Not even a little. But I understood. What else could they think? Their twenty-six-year-old son, drowning in debt, obsessed with a game, suddenly showing up with millions of won?\n\nThe silence stretched. Reality slowly sank in.\n\nFather spoke first, his voice rough. \"It's good. Earning money doing what you love.\" He cleared his throat. \"The past year wasn't wasted. You've found your aptitude. That settles something in my heart.\"\n\nMother clutched the bankbook. \"My friend told me about her friend's son. He earns good money from Satisfy. Became a huge ranker. Maybe you'll appear on TV?\" Her eyes brightened. \"Yes? My son on TV?\"\n\nSehee crossed her arms, but the corner of her mouth quirked up. \"So you're actually good at something.\" She huffed. \"Well, it's impressive. Among two billion users, earning this much proves you're talented.\" She glanced away. \"I guess you're qualified to be my brother.\"\n\nTheir gazes changed. The perpetual disappointment faded, replaced by something warmer. *My son did well.* *I should treat him better.*\n\nPride swelled in my chest. *Huhuhut.*\n\n\"Don't laugh,\" Sehee said. \"It's disturbing.\"\n\n\"...\""
