His Stealth skill sat at **Level 7**—even top rankers would struggle to pierce through it.\n\nHe held his breath, willing his body into absolute stillness. The air around him seemed to thicken.\n\n\"Don't peek at me like a pervert.\" Euphemina's voice cut through the silence. \"If you don't come out, I'll make you come out.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air like a blade. Faker's party members began whispering frantically through the mental link.\n\n*Hey Faker, don't you think she really noticed?*\n\n*It might be a mistake to keep hiding. Remove Stealth and reveal your identity.*\n\nFaker's jaw clenched. *Blacksmiths don't have any detection techniques. Even if such techniques existed, there's no possibility my stealth would be discovered. Don't worry. That woman is just bluffing.*\n\n**Peeeong!**\n\nA massive explosion erupted in a three-meter radius around Euphemina's body. The shockwave ripped through the air.\n\n\"Kuk!\" Faker threw himself backward, tumbling out of range. Heat washed over his face.\n\nEuphemina's eyes tracked his movement. \"Angel's Scream.\"\n\n**Biiiiiik.**\n\nThe ultrasound waves slammed into Faker's eardrums like needles. Pain lanced through his skull. Warmth trickled down the sides of his neck—blood. His ears were bleeding.\n\nEuphemina stared at him, her expression calm. \"Who are you? Why are you watching me?\"\n\n*Who is she?* The question echoed in Faker's mind. *How does a blacksmith use top-level magic in succession?*\n\nHe needed confirmation. Now.\n\nFaker's body blurred. Dozens of afterimages scattered across the alley as he moved. Euphemina's hat flew from her head, snatched by invisible fingers.\n\nBlonde hair spilled free. Her face matched their portrait perfectly. But the ID hovering above her head read **Euphemina**, not Erina.\n\n*We were wrong from the beginning.* The realization hit him like cold water. *All the information we gathered was false.*\n\nIt made sense now. Countless guilds were hunting for the maker of the <span class=\"rarity-epic\">Special Jaffa Arrows</span>. Fierce competition meant deception. False trails. Traps laid for competitors.\n\nFaker's teeth ground together. *We fell into a trap.*\n\nWorse—the item production game in Winston might have been theater from the start. If so, the Tzedakah Guild had been dancing on someone else's strings.\n\n\"Give it to me.\" Euphemina plucked her hat from Faker's hand. Her voice sharpened. \"Why are you taking my belongings instead of answering? This is annoying.\"\n\nFaker met her glare. \"What guild do you belong to?\"\n\nHer brow furrowed. \"I don't understand what you're talking about. Rather, shouldn't you answer? Why did you follow me for two days?\"\n\n\"You must be joking.\" Faker's hand drifted toward his dagger. \"If so, I will use force to make you tell the truth.\"\n\nThe Tzedakah Guild was a group of alphas. Every member carried aggression in their blood. Euphemina was no different.\n\n\"All the men I meet these days are like psychos.\" She shook her head. Grid was someone to protect, no matter how irritating he could be. But Faker? Different story. \"First you watched me, now you're threatening me? I'll have to fix that nasty attitude of yours. Lightning.\"\n\n**Pachchik!**\n\nStatic electricity crackled around Faker. The sky tore open.\n\n**Kwaang!**\n\nFaker moved. His body became a blur, afterimages scattering in every direction as the lightning bolt scorched the earth where he'd stood. He materialized behind Euphemina.\n\nHer hand pressed against his abdomen. \"Unfortunately for you, I won't fall for the same technique twice.\"\n\n**Peeng!**\n\nFlames engulfed Faker's body. But no scream came. No flinch. Euphemina had attacked a decoy.\n\n**Pakak!**\n\n\"Ugh!\" Her body jerked sideways from the kick that slammed into her ribs. She hit the ground hard, pain flaring through her side.\n\nFaker looked down at her. \"The same technique can be applied differently. It's certainly impressive that you can use magic without chanting, but you aren't my opponent.\"\n\nEuphemina pushed herself up, one hand pressed against her bruised ribs. For the first time since becoming a Duplicator, another player had landed a clean hit on her.\n\n*This man is strong.* She assessed him coolly. Top-level assassin techniques. Excellent combat sense. An opponent worth watching.\n\nBut that was all.\n\n\"It's only a moment of elation.\" She raised her hand. \"Ancient Queen's Knight.\"\n\nBrilliant light flooded the alley. Faker's vision whited out. When it cleared, his breath caught.\n\nA knight in black armor hovered in the air before him, wreathed in shadow.\n\n\"Familiar?!\" The word came out strangled. *Impossible. Magicians can't summon familiars. That requires a summoner's authority.*\n\n**Kuaaaaah!**\n\nThe Ancient Queen's Knight grasped a fragment of the darkness cloaking its body. The shadow solidified into a blade. The pressure radiating from the knight felt like a mountain about to collapse on his head.\n\n\"Kuk!\" Faker twisted aside. Assassins used stealth and precision. Head-on fights against knights meant death.\n\n**Kwaang!**\n\nThe knight's blade cleaved through the building's outer wall. Stone and dust exploded outward.\n\n**Pik!**\n\nA shard of stone sliced Faker's cheek. He ignored it. Ignored the knight. Three daggers flew from his hands toward Euphemina.\n\nThe blades cut through the air faster than any mage could dodge. Even if she tried to defend with magic, it wouldn't help. These daggers were designed to explode on contact with magical energy.\n\n*That's it!* Victory seemed certain.\n\nThen Euphemina moved.\n\nHer body blurred. Afterimages scattered across her position. All three daggers passed through empty air.\n\n*Unbelievable! After a familiar, she uses an assassin's skill?*\n\nNormally, identifying the real body among dozens of afterimages required absolute focus. But the Ancient Queen's Knight gave Faker no space to think. Its blade came down again and again, relentless.\n\nFaker's watching party members couldn't stand it anymore.\n\n\"We're going to help!\"\n\nFaker shook his head sharply.\n\n\"Are you still insisting on a one-on-one fight? Don't make us laugh! Don't ignore us!\"\n\n\"It can't be helped. She isn't an opponent you can win against alone! Do you think we'll leave you?\"\n\n\"Hiyah!\"\n\nFour members of the Tzedakah Guild, all top rankers, rushed forward.\n\nThey couldn't overpower Euphemina.\n\nOver the past month, Euphemina had duplicated techniques from rankers across the continent while searching for an orb production method. She stood at her peak.\n\n\"Dragon Claws.\"\n\nSharp stone pillars erupted from the ground in rapid succession. Faker dodged frantically, weaving between the deadly spikes. The Ancient Queen's Knight pressed him from one side while flames rained from the sky above.\n\n\"She's using high-grade spells in succession?\"\n\n\"No way...\"\n\nDespair crept across Faker's face. Across all their faces. They were witnessing Euphemina's true power.\n\n***\n\nJishuka's expression darkened as she surveyed the collapsed buildings in the middle of the city.\n\n\"Someone dares touch our guild?\"\n\nBefore Satisfy launched, the Tzedakah Guild had dominated L.T.S. as the strongest armed group. No one challenged them. Even the giant guilds kept their distance. Jishuka was determined to make Tzedakah the strongest guild in Satisfy as well. They'd already become famous among top rankers.\n\nBut fame and supremacy were different things. To reign at the top, they couldn't show even a hint of weakness.\n\nShe turned to her guild members. \"Find her right now. We'll show the dignity of the Tzedakah Guild by crushing her.\"\n\nThe opponent had defeated four guild members, including Faker. According to witnesses, she could use skills from all class types. Her strength was clearly abnormal.\n\n*Maybe she has a hidden class.*\n\nBut Jishuka wasn't afraid. The true power of the Tzedakah Guild remained hidden. Unshown.\n\nThus began the bitter rivalry between Euphemina and the Tzedakah Guild.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**\n\n**OG:** Glossary Link.\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
