  "content": "*Krrrsh!*\n\nThe blood Earl Cray had shed betrayed him. Four crimson tails writhed free of his control, answering only to Katz's will. What should have been instruments of slaughter turned against their master, fangs bared.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nThe serpentine coils constricted around Cray's throat. The Earl's eyes widened—*his* blood, flowing against his command. The crushing pressure threatened to pulverize his ancient bones.\n\n\"Filthy *human*...\"\n\nVampires viewed mankind as livestock. For a direct descendant like Cray, this reversal transcended humiliation—it was *impossible*.\n\n\"You *dare* defile my noble bloodline!\"\n\nUntil now, even under Grid and the Overgeared members' assault, Cray had remained composed. They were cattle thrashing in their pen, nothing more. But this? His face twisted into a demonic snarl as his fellow descendants erupted in laughter.\n\n\"Hahaha! Cray! How pathetic! A child of the Blood Ruler, humiliated by livestock?\"\n\n*Blood Ruler*—one of Shizo Beriache's many titles. In life, she had commanded all blood. Even the crimson flowing through an enemy's veins obeyed her will. She could puppet any living creature from within.\n\nCray claimed descent from that power. Among the earls, none bore greater pride in their inherited gifts. Yet here he was, throttled by a *human*. His brothers found it hysterical.\n\n\"**Silence!**\"\n\nCray's roar shattered the moment. Two tails exploded into mist. The remaining pair snapped back to his control, no longer responding to Katz.\n\nThe display exposed his incompleteness. Three tails offered devastating power—but only two answered his mastery. That incomplete control barred him from the rank of marquis.\n\n\"You... *vermin*... dare shame me?\"\n\nNow wielding only two tails, Cray looked diminished. He glared down at Katz with murder in his ancient eyes.\n\n\"**Die.** I'll remind you what prey truly is. Your throat. Your blood. Your flesh and hair—*all* mine.\"\n\nThe cruel proclamation manifested as raw power.\n\n[Vampire Earl Cray has used **Direct Suppression**.]  \n[Mortals cannot resist this force! You have fallen into 'fear' state.]\n\n\"Kuk...!\"\n\nThe Overgeared members trembled as primal terror seized them. Stats plummeted. Anxiety clawed at their hearts.\n\n\"**Purification!**\"\n\nRuby's warm radiance washed over them. The fear dissolved. They stood firm.\n\nCray and his brothers recoiled.\n\n\"What... *is* that strength?\"\n\nEvery creature had its place in the natural order. Pigs existed to feed humans. Humans existed to feed vampires. Fear before direct descendants was *destiny*. Yet this power twisted fate itself.\n\nThree pairs of ancient eyes shifted from Katz to Ruby. Aggro redirected—Grid to Katz to the Saintess. \n\nRegas, collapsed after his devastating blow, felt suddenly invisible.\n\n\"No, pay attention to *me*...\"\n\nWas he beneath their notice? The thought stung.\n\n\"Haha... I need more training.\"\n\n*Crackle!*\n\nLightning sparked across Regas's skin as his body began transforming—the descent of Asura.\n\nKatz glanced over. \"Why go Asura when you can't even fly?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nBrutal truth. Like most transformation skills, Asura had a time limit and penalty. Regas could only jump high—not soar. Meanwhile, vampires commanded the skies. Lesser bloodsuckers transformed to bats or mist, but direct descendants possessed passive flight. They moved through the air without restriction.\n\nAgainst aerial opponents, Regas and most Overgeared members were crippled.\n\nKatz intended to change that. He'd use Cray's grudge against him.\n\n\"*Tch!*\"\n\nHe made the sound deliberately loud, then shrugged at the Earl who'd promised his death.\n\n\"Big words from someone *scared* enough to hide in the sky. You're shouting from up there because you're *terrified*, right?\"\n\nKatz had once been infamous for his toxic personality. Provocation came naturally. But beneath the bravado, his mind remained sharp—the calculating edge of a top ranker constantly competing. \n\nCray, by contrast, had been born powerful. Few rivals. Little real combat experience. High pride. Short temper.\n\n\"Who fears *whom?!*\"\n\nHook, line, sinker.\n\n*BOOM!*\n\nCray slammed into the ground. His magic power detonated on impact, cratering the earth. The entire city shuddered. Katz and the Overgeared members staggered.\n\n[Vampire Earl Cray has used **Magic Power Emission**.]  \n[The earth convulses! Mana reverses!]  \n[You are affected by 'balance loss.' Movement severely restricted.]  \n[You have fallen into 'mana containment.' Mana unusable as a resource.]\n\n\"First, I'll tear out that **tongue!**\"\n\n\"Kuk...\"\n\nSweat traced down Katz's jaw as the enraged Earl bore down on him.\n\n*'Tremendous pressure. The absolute species gap in Satisfy.'*\n\nHidden classes specialized intensely in single traits—sometimes a weakness, usually a strength. The epic class Blood Warrior embodied the ultimate concept: *master of blood*. Katz could manipulate any flesh, including his own. His greatest asset.\n\nBut controlling Cray's tail had taught him a harsh truth. His epic-rated ability barely functioned against direct descendants. The proof? His special resource—Blood System—had drained *rapidly* the instant he seized control.\n\nBy Katz's calculations, he could maintain control for... one minute maximum. Even if Cray hadn't destroyed two tails, they'd have inevitably reverted. But Cray didn't *know* that. He'd reduced his arsenal, making Katz look formidable.\n\n\"Well, I don't need blood magic anyway.\" Katz's trembling hands drew the sword at his waist. \"I'm a warrior. Kukuk! I'll *kill* you!\"\n\n*Shhk!*\n\nHe lunged forward. The blood-drinking blade flashed—attack speed roughly a third of Grid's fully buffed velocity. Earl Cray wasn't built for physical combat. He couldn't dodge the strike.\n\nHe didn't *try*. Why would a man fear a puppy?\n\n*THUNK!*\n\n*Crunch-crunch-crunch-crunch!*\n\nKatz's sword pierced Cray's heart. Simultaneously, two crimson tails spread like a net, engulfing Katz's body. They constricted—a lasso of blood. Katz couldn't counter. A single blow carved away two-thirds of his health.\n\nBut he knew.\n\n\"This... should be enough... right?\"\n\nCray had descended. Abandoned his aerial advantage. All because of Katz's provocation. Now his comrades could fight.\n\nAbsolute trust.\n\nThey honored it.\n\n\"Katz! Behind me!\"\n\nToban and Vantner tore him from the crimson lasso, shields raised. Regas in full Asura form, Chris channeling maximum sword energy, Pon mounted on his white steed—three simultaneous strikes hammered into Cray.\n\n*Pang!*\n\n*Pepepepepok!*\n\nJishuka's arrows. Zednos and Laella's spells. Lauel's qigong blasts. Supporting fire rained down.\n\n\"Aren't I the most reliable in a boss raid?\"\n\n*Fwoosh!*\n\nIbellin's Thorn of Deep Grievance struck perfectly, its percentage-based damage carving into Cray's massive health pool.\n\nAll of this sustained by one person.\n\n\"Hah... hah...\"\n\nRuby. Satisfy's ultimate healer. Every wound mended. Every debuff cleansed. Her magic flowed continuously.\n\nThree direct descendants watched her with new eyes.\n\n\"That one... she's dangerous.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\nThey'd laughed while Cray struggled. But the Saintess? No mercy. They instinctively recognized the threat—a holy power capable of annihilating even great demons' souls.\n\n\"She dies. Now.\"\n\nThree ancient killers descended, surrounding Ruby.\n\n\"I'll protect Sehee!\"\n\nSexy Schoolgirl threw herself forward—but a level 200 player couldn't stop direct descendants who surpassed top rankers. Her Sacrifice skill might block a few attacks. Nothing more.\n\n\"Perish.\"\n\n\"I won't even drink your blood. Just... *ash*.\"\n\n*Whiiiiing!*\n\nDark magic coalesced in their palms, aimed at Ruby's face. She saw death approaching. Overgeared members lunged to save her—\n\n\"Where do you think you're *going?*\"\n\n*CRASH!*\n\n*BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!*\n\n\"**Guaaaah!**\"\n\n\"Sh-Shit...! Miss Ruby...!\"\n\nCray's dual tails whipped through their ranks like scythes. Bodies flew. Bones cracked. Still they reached desperately toward Ruby—she was *essential* to this raid. But the distance was too great. Their fingertips grasped empty air.\n\nExcept.\n\n\"I'll guard my sister.\"\n\nGrid materialized beside Ruby. He'd been waiting since Katz's arrival, sitting in a corner completing Item Combination. Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires merged with Failure.\n\n\"**Revolve.**\"\n\n*Pshew!*\n\n*Pepepepepok!*\n\nThe dark magic reversed trajectory, amplified, slamming back into the three descendants.\n\n[Fighting Energy has reached 80 points.]\n\nHis aura thickened—purple and red flames writhing together. Grid's roar split the air.\n\n\"**God Hands! Noe! Randy! Iyarugt!**\"\n\n*Krrrrrumble!*\n\nFour golden hands wielding Mjolnir. Noe, hell's supreme demonic beast, stealing the enemies' highest stats. Randy, transformed into Grid's duplicate. Iyarugt, hell's greatest swordsman. All manifested simultaneously, shackling the three descendants.\n\n\"**Open Rune of Darkness! Blacksmith's Rage!**\"\n\nDamage maximized.\n\n\"**Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle.**\"\n\nSatisfy's most devastating skill erupted toward Earl Cray—already grievously wounded. His eyes widened in shock, trying to understand why *he* was the target when three siblings stood nearby.\n\nHuroi answered for Grid.\n\n\"We always hit the *weakest* one!\"\n\n\"*What?!*\"\n\nWeak? Him? *Weak?!* Cray's composure shattered—and with it, his defenses.\n\n*Krrrrrumble!*\n\nConsecutive detonations of red lightning and black flames—enhanced by darkness bonuses, skill damage amplification, every multiplicative factor—**obliterated** him."
