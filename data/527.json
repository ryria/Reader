  "content": "Mook had always considered himself lucky. That confidence had taken root on the 7th island of the Behen Archipelago when he'd stumbled upon Fog Island. But the East Continent had shattered that illusion. \n\nThe reality was nothing like he'd imagined. The difficulty was crushing. For an entire month, Mook had been trapped in Pangea, reduced to little more than an errand boy for NPCs and a glorified pest exterminator.\n\n*I really have no luck at all.*\n\nThis wasn't what he'd signed up for. Back on the West Continent, he'd been a high-ranking player—respected, powerful, *relevant*. Those days felt like a distant dream now. Encountering Fog Island hadn't been good fortune at all. It had been a curse disguised as opportunity.\n\nHe wanted desperately to leave this godforsaken continent behind, but escape wasn't simple. He only possessed two East Continent Movement Scrolls—a direct consequence of clearing Fog Island too early and lacking the points needed for more.\n\nDay after miserable day dragged by in Pangea.\n\nUntil today changed everything.\n\n*I really am lucky!*\n\nThe rats had weakened overnight—dramatically so.\n\n*Heaven itself is helping me!*\n\nWhat had once been grueling battles against pairs of rats, requiring rest breaks after every four or five kills, had transformed into an effortless slaughter. He could hunt for thirty minutes straight without pause, his stamina and mana barely touched.\n\nThe experience rewards had dropped, yes, but the sheer volume of kills more than compensated. As they pushed deeper into the monster community, experience steadily accumulated. Gallbladders dropped with satisfying regularity—enough to potentially reach 30% poison and confusion resistance.\n\n*Should I just stay here and grind? With 30% poison resistance, I could finally tackle those poisonous trolls on the West Continent...*\n\nBut the golden walnuts weighed on his mind. They were too valuable to waste frivolously.\n\n*Better to save them... Right?*\n\nEvan's voice cut through Mook's internal debate. \"We can level on the West Continent. The gallbladders will still be here later. Don't forget why we came—titles, skills, and items. That's the real prize.\"\n\nLane nodded firmly. \"Evan's right. Don't get tunnel vision over short-term gains. We have a responsibility to escape Pangea.\"\n\n\"Time is critical,\" Oshihoz added. \"Every day we waste, the gap between us and the frontrunners grows. We can't afford to fall so far behind we never catch up.\"\n\nThe words struck home.\n\n\"You're right. All of you.\" Mook's resolve hardened. \n\nThe newcomer—the masked man who'd arrived with such convenient timing—would be their ticket out of Pangea. Mook steadied himself and checked the party window.\n\n**Lane** — Level 311  \nClass: ???\n\n**Mook** — Level 310  \nClass: ???\n\n**Evan** — Level 312  \nClass: ???\n\n**Oshihoz** — Level 310  \nClass: ???\n\n**??** — Level 320  \nClass: ???\n\nThe four of them had met here on the East Continent. Despite their shared circumstances, they'd known each other for such a short time that true trust remained elusive. They only formed parties occasionally to challenge the Big Poisonous Rat community, and even then, everyone kept their class information private.\n\nStill, Mook didn't see cause for excessive caution.\n\n*The PvP gap between combat classes isn't that wide. The balance is solid.*\n\nThe masked man's level 320 status was mildly concerning—the skills available at that threshold were notoriously powerful. But it was four against one. Even if their plan fell apart and their true intentions were exposed, he wouldn't stand a chance...\n\n*There's nothing to worry about!*\n\nMook hid a wicked grin behind his hand.\n\n\"Everyone, hold position.\"\n\nThey'd nearly reached the center of the community. The moonless night cloaked them in shadow. In the distance, the Queen Rat's enormous tent loomed.\n\n\"Half-face.\"\n\n*Me?*\n\nThe nickname stemmed from his half-mask, presumably.\n\n*What kind of naming sense is that?*\n\nIf they were going to base it on his mask, something like \"Mask Man\" would've been preferable. Grid suppressed his irritation and responded evenly.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"See that large tent ahead?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"The community's leader lives there.\"\n\n*I killed her already.*\n\nField bosses typically respawned after three days. The Queen Rat Grid had eliminated earlier was almost certainly a named boss—her death had weakened the entire Big Poisonous Rat population immediately. The next Queen Rat would likely spawn significantly weaker.\n\nUnfortunately for Mook, he had no idea the boss had already been defeated. The thought hadn't even crossed his mind.\n\n\"We don't have the numbers to take down the leader. The Queen Rat is incredibly strong. How strong?\" Mook paused dramatically. \"Put it this way—even famous players like Kraugel, Zibal, and Grid couldn't hunt it as a party.\"\n\n*Why is my name last?*\n\nHis ego stung at being listed after Kraugel. Grid's tone sharpened. \"So?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, defeating the leader is essential. Why? Because it's the only way to access the fantasy hunting ground beyond this one—which is vastly superior.\"\n\n*If that fantasy hunting ground is just the next monster community... I can walk right in since the queen's already dead.*\n\nGrid kept that observation to himself. Explaining how he'd soloed the Queen Rat sounded tedious.\n\n*Though I do wonder how they planned to defeat her originally.*\n\nHis curiosity stirred as Mook produced a small pouch and held it out.\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\nMook's laugh held a conspiratorial edge. \"Open it. Just walnuts.\"\n\n\"Walnuts?\"\n\n\"All the Big Poisonous Rats, including the Queen, have a weakness for walnuts. They'll lure her out.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\nGrid opened the pouch. True enough—walnuts. Unpeeled, each one large and perfect with an extraordinarily smooth surface.\n\n\"Starting now, place these walnuts at two-meter intervals leading up to the Queen Rat's tent entrance. She'll be drawn by the scent and follow the trail away from the nest.\"\n\n\"And you'll use that opening to leave the community?\"\n\nGrid's eyes flashed behind the mask—sharp, penetrating.\n\n*What the—? In that moment, he seems like a completely different person...*\n\nThose eyes were predatory. They looked *down* on them with aristocratic disdain. Like a sovereign surveying lesser beings. Behind the mask, they gleamed with the calculating focus of a raptor eyeing prey. It was a presence that demanded submission. Grid's naturally fierce gaze, amplified by his high Dignity stat, created an overwhelming aura.\n\n\"Haha...\" Mook's breath caught in his throat. He recovered quickly, maintaining his smile through force of will. \"What are you saying? Of course not. Naturally, we won't leave without you.\"\n\nGrid's eyes returned to normal.\n\n\"Wait. If I place walnuts at the tent entrance, won't I become the Queen Rat's target? Are you planning to run while I'm being attacked?\"\n\n\"No, no. The Queen Rat only cares about the walnuts. She won't even notice you.\"\n\n\"How can I trust that? Why not do it yourself?\"\n\n\"Haha, didn't I mention? We know many excellent hunting grounds. This method is how we always move between fantasy hunting grounds. Placing walnuts at the Queen Rat's tent entrance is routine for us. We're offering you this role so you can experience the thrill of advancing to the next area.\"\n\n*This doesn't add up.*\n\nHis story was obviously false. But Grid felt generous—almost amused. The Queen Rat wasn't even there. No danger existed, so no reason to refuse. Grid nodded.\n\n\"Understood. I'll trust you and do my part.\"\n\n\"Excellent choice.\"\n\nRelief washed over Mook's face, accompanied by a nasty grin he couldn't quite suppress.\n\n*The Queen Rat does like walnuts—but she likes human flesh even more. She'll try to taste you before touching those nuts.*\n\nBe the scapegoat as planned. In that window, they'd escape this hellhole and finally say goodbye to Pangea! \n\nMook's party departed, leaving Grid behind. Grid watched them retreat into the darkness, then pulled a walnut from the pouch.\n\n\"No need to scatter these for a Queen Rat that isn't even here.\"\n\nBetter to enjoy them while traveling to the next hunting ground. With close to 3,000 Strength, the hard shell crumbled like paper beneath Grid's fingers. The legendary Dexterity he'd honed ensured the shell pulverized completely while the kernel remained pristine.\n\n\"Let's see...\"\n\nGrid placed the walnut in his mouth.\n\n*Delicious!*\n\nHis eyes widened. The moment it touched his tongue, an intense, uniquely nutty flavor exploded across his palate. Sweetness bloomed as he chewed. It was so superior to Idan's cooking that Grid felt tears prick his eyes.\n\n\"I have to eat more— Huh?\"\n\nGrid had swallowed one walnut and reached for another when he froze. He went rigid as a statue, stunned by the incredible effects.\n\n>[You have eaten a Golden Walnut.]\n>\n>[All stats will increase by 10% for one hour.]\n>\n>[The Golden Walnut's kernel is perfect without any damage. It provides a complete supply of nutrients.]\n>\n>[Intelligence has permanently increased by 5.]\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nGrid couldn't process the information.\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nEmotion overwhelmed him—something beyond simple joy.\n\n\"Those people... They're the biggest pushovers I've ever seen.\"\n\nThey'd mistaken these miraculous walnuts for common nuts and tried to *feed them to monsters*? How pathetically incompetent. They couldn't even protect their own treasures.\n\n\"Good grief. Tsk, tsk. And here I thought they might be scammers.\"\n\nGrid clicked his tongue and carefully transferred the walnut pouch into a secure section of his inventory.\n\nOf course, there was absolutely no chance he'd return the walnuts to Mook."
