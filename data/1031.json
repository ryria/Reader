  "content": "# Chapter: Recognition and Rewards\n\n## S.A. Group Headquarters\n\n*Crack.* A chicken leg hit the floor.\n\n*Thud.* A wing slipped from nerveless fingers.\n\nSilence filled the monitoring room as the world message faded from the screens. Every employee sat frozen, staring at the scattered remains of their meal.\n\n\"...Ah.\" Director Yoon Sangmin finally snapped out of his daze and glanced down at the spilled chicken littering the table. He exhaled slowly. At least he'd dropped the breast, not something messier. He grabbed a bottle of water instead of his beer, wiping the spicy sauce from his mouth.\n\n\"I was certain Agnus would be first to the third class,\" he muttered. \"Didn't expect that reversal.\"\n\nTechnically, being 'first' meant little in practical terms. No special rewards came with the distinction—only honor. Currently, 1,311 players possessed a second class. Among them, only one could claim the title of 'First to Obtain a Second Class': Huroi.\n\nAn eternal record. Unchangeable. Unbreakable.\n\nThe same would now apply to Grid. Out of two billion players, he stood alone. But that wasn't what had everyone stunned into silence.\n\n**[An unknown player has achieved a third class for the first time.]**\n\n**[Their legend will begin as a tale and end as a myth.]**\n\nThe world message still glowed on every monitor. Anyone who saw it would understand—myth-rated classes existed. The implications were staggering.\n\n\"...The man himself is taking it awfully calmly,\" someone observed.\n\nGrid showed no elation. No celebration. He remained laser-focused on the battle with the follower, then on overcoming the War God's curse. The employees watching his feed had forgotten their dinner entirely, waiting for the moment Grid would finally let loose and rejoice. They wanted that vicarious satisfaction, that warm feeling of witnessing someone's triumph. Many knew Grid's history—his struggles, his determination. They wanted to root for him.\n\nBut Grid remained impassive even as he reached the Secret Technique Box at the waterfall.\n\n\"Is it really possible to be that casual about a growth-type legendary class?\" one employee asked, confusion evident.\n\n\"Why wouldn't it be?\"\n\nThe response came from a senior staffer who'd been monitoring Grid since the beginning. Grid's achievements had piled up over the years, each one extraordinary. First to acquire a legendary class. First to forge legendary items. First player king through the founding of the Overgeared Kingdom. Hero who saved the Eternal Kingdom.\n\nMost gold medals in the National Competition. Hero King who cleansed the Behen Archipelago. Inheritor of both Braham's and the Undefeated King Madra's power. The list went on—Grid possessed numerous unique titles. He'd opened diplomatic channels with the Saharan Empire. He'd ascended to Asgard itself to challenge a god.\n\nAny single one of Grid's accomplishments would make an ordinary player a world star or high ranker. Even among his own achievements, this one stood out. It should warrant a reaction.\n\n\"Maybe there's less satisfaction because it came from coincidence and luck?\" suggested another employee.\n\nThe comment wasn't sarcastic—they genuinely wondered. After all, Agnus was on track to earn his third class, Demon World Noble, within months through pure effort and planning. But Grid's Magic Swordsman of the Epics? That seemed like a chain of fortunate accidents. If Skunk hadn't discovered the Ruins of the War God, if Grid hadn't entered them, if Braham hadn't awakened...\n\nSeveral executives exchanged glances, then shook their heads.\n\n\"Coincidence and luck? Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"Grid secured the sea route by planting Huroi in enemy territory months in advance. That was strategy.\"\n\n\"Katz's financial backing provided critical resources.\"\n\n\"Grid created the Master Key and maximized his affinity with Braham. Every piece was deliberate preparation. This third class is the result of his groundwork.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Someone unprepared can't capitalize on opportunities, no matter how lucky they get.\"\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nPerhaps it was the alcohol talking, but those who'd initially dismissed Grid's achievement as mere fortune fell silent. They mentally apologized to Grid. The S.A. Group's executive monitoring room had transformed into an impromptu Grid fan club meeting.\n\nChairman Lim Cheolho wiped his brow. *Have any of you finished your actual work?*\n\n---\n\n## The Waterfall\n\nThe Overgeared members and the imperial dukes had fought through the jungle and defeated the follower who'd mastered ten secret techniques. Their accomplishments warranted exceptional rewards.\n\n**[Secret Technique Box]**\n\n**[Contains a secret technique of War God Zeratul.]**\n\nA technique of the War God himself.\n\nThe ultimate skill book.\n\nGrid's expression brightened as he accepted the box. The revelation that Satisfy's final boss might not be the Evil God Yatan had shaken him briefly, but he'd regained his composure.\n\n*Does it matter if Goddess Rebecca is the true enemy?* \n\nPlayers couldn't fight dragons. They couldn't challenge gods alone. The final boss—whoever that might be—would be handled by entities beyond the players' reach. No point worrying about threats to his people and family from some nebulous ultimate darkness.\n\n*Just get stronger. Enjoy the journey.*\n\nGrid centered himself and produced the Master Key, unlocking the box with a satisfying *click*. But he didn't immediately throw it open. First, something needed addressing.\n\nMaximizing the natural authority of his Dignity stat, Grid addressed the dukes. \"I believe I have the right to claim this. Do any of you disagree?\"\n\nTension rippled through the Red Knights. Yes, Grid had been instrumental in breaking through the jungle and defeating the ten-technique follower. But the dukes would have reached this point eventually without him—it simply would've taken longer and cost more lives. Moreover, the dukes themselves had fought more followers than anyone else during the advance.\n\nA secret technique of the War God... Honestly, such a mythical treasure belonged in the imperial vault. No knight could easily concede something so valuable.\n\n...Or so the knights assumed.\n\n\"Of course it belongs to Your Majesty,\" Immortal King Grenhal said, bowing slightly.\n\n\"Without Your Majesty, none of us would be alive,\" Gold Crown Basara added with genuine respect. \"We have no claim to the secret technique.\"\n\nBeast King Morse muttered under his breath, \"Our contributions weren't insignificant... His Majesty the Emperor might take issue later... But fine, the Overgeared King's merit is undeniable. We'll claim the next reward...\" Despite his grumbling, Morse didn't object.\n\nSetting aside politics and pride, Grid had earned this.\n\n\"Thank you for your understanding.\"\n\nHe hadn't needed their permission—he had every right to the reward. But by acknowledging their concession with grace, Grid elevated their pride. The dukes' affinity with him increased by several points.\n\nGrid turned to his companions. The Overgeared members seemed more interested in the world message that had appeared moments ago.\n\n\"I'll explain everything later. First, let's see what's inside and determine who should have it.\"\n\nHundreds of secret techniques existed—maybe thousands, judging by the variety they'd encountered so far. If this technique focused on spear work, it would go to Pon. Shield techniques to Vantner. Grid had no intention of monopolizing the reward. This was an opportunity to compensate his companions for the sacrifices they'd made fighting the empire on his behalf.\n\n\"Fair approach,\" Lauel agreed.\n\nThe reluctant-looking meritorious retainers nodded. They needed to grow stronger. If they didn't, they'd only hold Grid back.\n\n*I can't keep relying on him,* each member silently vowed. *I need to become strong enough to repay this investment tenfold.*\n\nHurent and Skunk exchanged impressed glances. The secret technique belonged to Grid by right of conquest, yet he'd declared his intention to share it fairly. Most guild masters couldn't manage that level of selflessness. Organizations ran on people, but too many leaders got blinded by immediate profit.\n\n*A true leader,* Skunk thought. Maybe joining Overgeared, as Lauel suggested, wouldn't be such a bad idea. He could recommend Grid to his colleagues with confidence.\n\nGrid opened the box.\n\nLight erupted—brilliant, cascading colors that cycled through the spectrum in rapid succession. The gorgeous display amplified everyone's anticipation.\n\nA grin spread across Grid's face.\n\n*This is a gacha draw.*\n\nThe cycling colors made it obvious. The Secret Technique Box operated on a random draw system, with different techniques of varying rarity and value. That explained why a random selection method was necessary.\n\n*But I have Good Luck!*\n\nHis Good Luck stat was substantial. He wasn't the unfortunate bastard from the early days anymore. Fortune smiled on him now.\n\n*I'll pull the highest-grade technique!*\n\nGrid's confidence soared.\n\n**Ding~!**\n\nThe light show concluded, revealing the box's contents.\n\n**[You have acquired the secret technique 'Light Footwork Technique: Empty Approach Path'!]**\n\n**[Light Footwork Technique: Empty Approach Path]**  \n**Category:** Skill Book  \n**Rating:** Legendary  \n**A legendary light footwork technique that allows the user to walk through the sky.**  \n**Learning Requirements: 8,000 Agility**\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe Overgeared members' faces went pale as they read the requirements. Now they understood the follower's lament about 'never seeing the end of the path.' Still, Grid's expression remained bright.\n\n**[Acquiring this secret technique has unlocked the Secret Technique Synthesis system.]**\n\n**[You may combine 10 damaged fragments with one complete secret technique to create a new technique.]**\n\n**[The resulting technique will be of the same type, though its rating may decrease.]**\n\n\"So synthesis can only produce Light Footwork Techniques?\" Grid asked, sharing the system notification with his companions.\n\nLauel nodded. \"Appears that way.\"\n\n\"Then lowering the rating through synthesis is clearly the better option right now.\"\n\n\"Absolutely. That's why the followers kept dropping damaged technique fragments.\"\n\nEight thousand Agility was practically impossible for current players. Maybe someday, years from now, someone might reach that threshold. Until then, a lower-rated technique with achievable requirements was infinitely more valuable than an unusable legendary one.\n\nGrid pulled out the damaged technique fragments from his inventory—nearly fifty in total.\n\n**[Attempting Secret Technique Synthesis!]**\n\n**[Synthesis successful! You have acquired 'Light Footwork Technique: Walk on Snow with No Traces'!]**\n\n**[Light Footwork Technique: Walk on Snow with No Traces]**  \n**Rating:** Legendary  \n**So light and agile that you leave no footprints in snow.**  \n**Learning Requirements: 6,000 Agility**\n\n\"...Anyone else feel like shit right now? Show of hands.\"\n\nOne synthesis down. Eight more to go.\n\n**[Synthesis successful! You have acquired 'Light Footwork Technique: Fly on Top of Grass'!]**\n\nAfter exactly nine attempts, burning through every fragment Grid and the Overgeared members had collected:\n\n**[Light Footwork Technique: Fly on Top of Grass]**  \n**Rating:** Epic  \n**A light footwork technique that allows running across grass.**  \n**Learning Requirements: 3,000 Agility**\n\nThey'd finally obtained a technique someone could actually learn. Faker immediately claimed it. The skill description seemed simple, almost underwhelming, but the actual effects...\n\n**[All movement speeds increased by 20%]**\n\n**[Movement speed doubled in forests and grasslands]**\n\n\"Holy shit...\"\n\nJackpot.\n\nThe party's hunger for more secret techniques intensified dramatically."
