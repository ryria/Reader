  "content": "**Enhanced Belial's Horn.**\n\nGrid stared at the material in his hand. Like the byproducts harvested from divine beasts, a great demon's remains carried the weight of myth. It made sense—Belial had been one of hell's sovereigns, an entity that transcended the mortal plane. Of course her horn would eclipse ordinary materials.\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nAnticipation swelled in his chest. The weapons he'd already forged from unenhanced Belial's Horn possessed devastating power. What heights would this upgraded material reach?\n\n*Two options? Four? Maybe even more—*\n\n**Thump. Thump.**\n\nHis heartbeat thundered in his ears.\n\n*Calm down.*\n\nGrid knew from bitter experience how critical composure was at the forge. Rush the work, ruin the product—he'd lived that nightmare too many times. He drew a slow breath, then another, forcing his excitement back down into something manageable.\n\nThe smithy's background noise faded.\n\nKhan and the gathered blacksmiths vanished from his awareness.\n\nGrid reviewed his techniques. Catalogued his past mistakes. Visualized his objective. Time stretched and contracted, measured only in the rhythm of his breathing.\n\nMinutes passed. Or perhaps hours.\n\nThe watching craftsmen held their collective breath as Grid's eyes transformed—deepening, darkening, until they resembled twin abysses staring into the heart of creation itself.\n\n*A clear mind. Perfect focus.*\n\nGoosebumps rippled across Khan's weathered skin.\n\n**CLAAAANG!**\n\nGrid's hammer struck. The sound resonated through the massive workspace—pure, crystalline, *perfect*.\n\n*Ah...*\n\nWhite of the White Hammer Smithy. Enoch of the Blue Flames Smithy. Byuksan of the Black Anvil Smithy. Lahochu of the Red Tongs Smithy. Pangea's four legendary craftsmen stood transfixed, inspiration flooding through them as they witnessed true mastery.\n\n[White has achieved enlightenment! The wall blocking his advancement to craftsman rank has developed cracks...]\n\n[Enoch has achieved enlightenment! He glimpses the path beyond advanced technique...]\n\n[Byuksan has achieved enlightenment...]\n\n[Lahochu has achieved enlightenment...]\n\n\"Oh... *Ohhhhhh!*\"\n\nKhan's elderly frame trembled. In his mind's eye, he saw it—the glorious future of the Overgeared Kingdom, a nation of master craftsmen standing at the pinnacle of their art. He desperately wanted to witness that future. To help build it. To stand beside Grid as their dream became reality.\n\nHis burning desire transmitted itself to his young friend at the anvil.\n\n*Khan.*\n\n**TANG! TANG!**\n\nGrid reached his peak. The tempering of Belial's Horn became something transcendent as he felt the fervent hope radiating from the man who had been friend, teacher, and father all at once. He poured everything into each strike—strength, skill, and love.\n\n*Don't you dare die before I teach you everything I know.*\n\nHis first friend. His best friend. Grid wanted Khan beside him forever.\n\nThat wish elevated his concentration past its limits. Self-transcendence bloomed. Grid forgot himself entirely—hammer and smith became one, unified in purpose, until even Belial's Horn seemed to dissolve into pure potential waiting to be shaped.\n\n[Extreme concentration achieved. Legendary Blacksmith's Breath activated.]\n\n[Extreme concentration achieved. Legendary Blacksmith's Patience activated.]\n\n[Legendary Blacksmith's Breath activated.]\n\n[Legendary Blacksmith's Patience activated.]\n\n...\n\n**CLAAAANG!**\n\nWith each impact, the horn flashed crimson and obsidian. Gradually, inexorably, the material that would forge the world's strongest weapon took the form of a blade.\n\n\"...Finally.\"\n\nWhen Grid stepped back, even he was stunned by what he'd created.\n\n> **[Blade Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires]**\n> \n> Rating: Myth\n> \n> Durability: 1,660/1,660 \n> Attack Power: 3,500\n> \n> * **+20% Physical Attack Power**\n> * **+20% Magic Attack Power**  \n> * **+30% Fire Damage**\n> * **+30% Dark Damage**\n> * **+50% Damage vs. Sacred Beings**\n> * **Certain chance to release flames (large) on attack**\n> * **Low chance to release illusions on attack**\n> ★ **Certain chance to trigger Black Flames explosion on attack**\n> * **Creates skill: Enlightenment**\n> * **Creates skill: Ecstasy of Desire**\n> \n> *A blade destined to transcend legend and become myth itself. Its wielder will carve achievements into history and inspire hymns for generations unborn.*\n> \n> *Of course, this assumes someone actually attaches a handle first.*\n> \n> *The blacksmith Grid has surpassed divine craftsmanship, sharing his enlightenment and passion with all who witnessed this creation.*\n> \n> *The silver blade flickers with dancing flames—artistry rare even in dragon hoards.*\n> \n> *The hidden Black Flames property manifests because Belial's Horn's true essence was drawn forth completely.*\n> \n> *Black Flames explosions ignore all fire and dark resistance, devastating the surrounding area.*\n> \n> **Requirements:** Top three ranked users in any sword-compatible class (handle attachment required)\n> \n> Weight: 1,999\n\n> **[Enlightenment Lv. 1]**\n> \n> Persistent passive.\n> \n> * **+10% Character Experience**\n> * **+10% Skill Experience**  \n> * **+20% Accuracy**\n> * **+20% Evasion**\n> \n> *Myth-rated item skills can be upgraded.*\n\n> **[Ecstasy of Desire Lv. 1]**  \n> \n> Conditional passive.\n> \n> When fighting higher-level enemies, very low chance to enter 'selfless' state if health drops below threshold:\n> \n> * **Attack Power x3**\n> * **99% Evasion**  \n> * **0 Defense**\n> * **Duration: 20 seconds**\n> \n> *Myth-rated item skills can be upgraded.*\n\n\"Ah... shit.\"\n\nNine options. He'd identified eight possible properties when crafting with Belial's Horn, but somehow all nine had manifested in this single weapon.\n\n\"...This is insane.\"\n\nThe flames (large) property alone dealt 5,000 fixed fire damage per proc—admittedly reduced by resistance, but still devastating. Grid had always coveted that effect. Now he had it, plus eight more options stacked on top.\n\nThe hidden Black Flames attribute made his pulse quicken.\n\n*Ignores resistances entirely...*\n\nThe explosion was almost certainly splash damage. Perhaps comparable to the 5,000 from flames (large). Even half that would be catastrophic.\n\nEnlightenment wasn't quite Kraugel's Super Sensitivity, but the experience boost and combat bonuses would be invaluable. The durability, the attack power—everything was perfect.\n\nExcept.\n\n*Ecstasy of Desire.*\n\nThe skill reminded him of the Sword of Self-transcendence from his newbie days—but elevated to an extreme. Perfect State of Self-transcendence had doubled all stats in exchange for Grid's consciousness, leaving him defenseless for two seconds afterward.\n\n*This is obviously superior. Triple attack power beats double stats, and 99% evasion is...*\n\nPractically godlike. Avoid ninety-nine attacks out of a hundred? That was borderline cheating.\n\nBut.\n\n*Defense drops to zero.*\n\nA 1% chance of getting hit shouldn't matter with 99% evasion. For anyone else, zero defense would be irrelevant.\n\nBut Grid wasn't anyone else. Grid was *unlucky*. That 1% loomed like a death sentence.\n\n*Goddammit... this feels like a trap...*\n\nNo. He was jumping to conclusions. Grid shook his head and drew the Sword Ghost, still fitted with the pulling device. He attached the Enlightenment Blade to the silver thread's opposite end.\n\nThe watching blacksmiths leaned forward, finally understanding the mysterious tool's purpose. Then—\n\n*Click.*\n\n**SHHHHRRRK!**\n\n*Clink!*\n\nThe blade shot forward and locked seamlessly onto the Sword Ghost's handle. Revelation dawned on the observers—Grid had a reason for choosing Sword Ghost specifically.\n\n> **[Sword Ghost (Small Piece) and Blade Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires have merged.]**\n> \n> **[Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires]**\n> \n> Rating: Myth\n> \n> ...\n> \n> * **Accumulates +10% attack power per consecutive hit on same target (max 100%)**\n> \n> *A sword destined to transcend legend and become myth itself. Its wielder will carve achievements into history and inspire hymns for generations unborn...*\n\nSword Ghost's design philosophy centered on sustained combat—comfortable handling combined with exponentially scaling attack power. Easy to use. Devastatingly strong. Grid had obsessed over adding Sword Ghost's strength to his new blade.\n\nThis was the result.\n\n*Click.*\n\n**SHHHHRRRK!**\n\n*Clink!*\n\nThe blade separated and flew through the air. A God Hand snatched it mid-flight, sliding it into Grid's belt in a fraction of a second. Weapon swap complete at light speed.\n\n\"...Incredible.\"\n\nThe blacksmiths stood with mouths agape, Grid's intent finally crystal clear.\n\n---\n\n[Enhancement failed. +0 Blade Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires remains unchanged.]\n\n[Enhancement failed. +0 Blade Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires remains unchanged.]\n\n[Enhancement failed. +0 Blade Born from...]\n\n\"...\"\n\nTears stung Grid's eyes. Jishuka had warned him myth-rated gear was brutally difficult to enhance, but experiencing it firsthand was agony.\n\n\"Fuck this.\"\n\nDignity forgotten, Grid stormed out of the smithy. He needed to hit something—test the weapon's power on training dummies before he lost his mind completely.\n\nMoments later—\n\n**BOOOOOOM!**\n\n\"Was that Pounding Mortar?\"\n\nReinhardt trembled. The shockwave was identical to when Piaro and Kraugel had clashed in Reidan."
