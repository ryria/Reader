  "content": "Grid collapsed into bed, utterly drained. The day had stretched impossibly long, each moment weighted with life and death. As his head hit the pillow, he gazed at Irene and Lord sleeping beside him. In the dim light, his wife looked almost angelic, and his son's peaceful face made his chest ache with tenderness.\n\nHe reached out, carefully stroking their heads, though his expression remained dark with unresolved questions.\n\n*Why did Agnus do it?*\n\nEveryone had confirmed the story—not just Irene and Lord, but the Rebecca clergy, the Overgeared knights, even Pope Damian himself. They all said the same thing: Agnus had protected Grid's family. The same Agnus who'd been helping the Yatan Church had suddenly turned on them to save Irene and Lord.\n\nIt made no sense. Grid knew what that betrayal must have cost him. So why? Why would that madman—someone who lived for battle and cruelty, who laughed while trampling others—risk everything to protect Grid's wife and son?\n\nNo matter how Grid turned it over in his mind, he couldn't find an answer.\n\n\"...Maybe I'm overthinking this.\" He exhaled slowly. \"You don't call someone a madman if their actions make sense.\"\n\nAgnus was unpredictable, probably impulsive. Trying to understand him was a waste of energy. Grid pushed the thoughts away with conscious effort.\n\n*I just need to protect what's important to me. That's all that matters.*\n\nThat was the promise he had to keep. And whatever Agnus's reasons, Grid couldn't deny the outcome—his family was alive. That was a debt he wouldn't forget.\n\nThe steady rhythm of Irene's and Lord's breathing gradually calmed his turbulent thoughts. Grid took a deep breath, centering himself, then finally turned his attention to the notification windows he'd been ignoring.\n\n\"Ah...\" He'd completely forgotten he was in the middle of a quest.\n\nToday hadn't felt like a game at all. There had been no room in his mind for anything except saving his family.\n\n*Right. I gave up the holy sword.*\n\nIf he'd kept it, he would have become a half-god—powerful enough to overwhelm the world. Grid let out a bitter laugh, disgusted by the greed that had nearly made him sacrifice everything that mattered: his family, his comrades, his kingdom.\n\n*But greed is natural,* he thought, scanning the quest rewards.\n\n>Reward for Claiming the Incomplete Holy Sword:\n>You will acquire the 'Holy Sword of the 4th Evil.'\n>* Your race will evolve from human to half-god. A half-god transcends humanity and approaches divinity. All abilities will have vast room for growth.\n>* The passive skill 'God's Command' will be strengthened to 100% activation rate. However, skills activated through God's Command will not apply critical hits.\n>* The skill 'Corrupted Holy Sword' will be unlocked.\n>* You will be cursed by Goddess Rebecca, God Dominion, God Judar, and God Zeratul.\n>* Affinity with the Rebecca Church, Dominion Church, and Judar Church will drop to negative values.\n>* Followers of the War God will hunt you.\n>\n>Reward for Returning the Incomplete Holy Sword:\n>Goddess Rebecca's blessing. Affinity with the Rebecca Church will rise to maximum.\n>* Affinity with the Rebecca Church is already at maximum.\n\nThe gap between the two paths was staggering. Grid understood exactly what he'd given up. He'd gained the Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle skill through the goddess's blessing before—likely, another blessing would grant him a four-fusion skill, something exceptionally powerful.\n\nBut was that better than 100% activation of God's Command? With guaranteed activation, he could use every skill twice in succession without fail. The value of that ability dwarfed even Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle.\n\n*...Well.* Grid pushed down the flicker of regret. He'd made his choice. Everyone he cared about was safe—that was what mattered.\n\nHe focused on the waiting notification.\n\n>The goddess of light, Rebecca, awaits your response.\n\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting,\" Grid said.\n\n*—Yes, I was waiting. It warms my heart to see you value your family so highly.*\n\nGrid's eyes widened. He'd heard Rebecca's voice before, but never like this—never so clear, so... conversational. Divine messages were supposed to be one-way communications, weren't they? He'd always thought of the gods as extensions of the system, but now a new possibility emerged.\n\n*An NPC? The god is an NPC?*\n\nHe should have realized it when Hexetia's jealousy was mentioned. The gods clearly had distinct personalities. They existed *somewhere* with individual consciousness.\n\n*If I ever meet a god face to face...*\n\nA chill ran down his spine as a conversation with Braham resurfaced in his memory.\n\n*'When human desire reaches its zenith, chaos will consume the world. If Goddess Rebecca relinquishes control, God Yatan's destructive nature will take over. Yatan will annihilate everything, then Rebecca will create anew. The two opposing gods work in concert—demons, angels, and humans are all pawns in their game.'*\n\nThat was Braham's theory. He'd gone further:\n\n*'Perhaps there are no true gods at all. Yatan? Rebecca? They're not omnipotent beings. They're more like... machinery, accessories existing to maintain the world's natural order. There's no reason to worship them or endure their trials.'*\n\nAt the time, Grid had agreed. He knew Satisfy was a game—Yatan and Rebecca were part of Lim Cheolho's system, passive entities conforming to the world's programmed will.\n\nBut if they were NPCs with personalities... that changed everything. They weren't passive. They could make independent judgments, potentially even defy the system.\n\nConsider the quest itself:\n\n>Crossroad of Good and Evil\n>★ Hidden Quest ★\n>After countless trials, you have obtained the power 'God's Command' that the fourth malignant saint 'Taren' left for future generations.\n\nAccording to Satisfy's lore—Lim Cheolho's design—this quest was Taren's legacy. That was meant to be the \"truth.\"\n\nBut then Goddess Rebecca had said: *'Human, this isn't Taren's arrangement. This is Dominion's and my arrangement. Don't listen to the corrupted one's voice.'*\n\nThis suggested War God Zeratul might have lied. Goosebumps prickled across Grid's skin.\n\n*—Thank you again for fighting for humanity's peace.*\n\nRebecca's voice was so warm it felt almost unsettling. Grid kept his expression neutral, but his mind raced.\n\n>The goddess of light, Rebecca, awaits your response.\n\nThe notification forced him to answer. \"I only did what I had to,\" Grid said quickly.\n\nThe gods weren't evil. They weren't merely system constructs either. They were NPCs with individual wills.\n\n*So what?*\n\nThey dwelt in the distant heavens and acted as powerful allies against the great demons. There was no problem. He was just one player—he didn't need to worry about the nature of divinity.\n\n*Still...*\n\nIt was troubling that the seven malignant saints might not be the villains everyone believed them to be.\n\nBrilliant light enveloped Grid's body as he frowned.\n\n*—I will give a gift to the hero who fought so valiantly.*\n\n>Rebecca, goddess of light, has bestowed her blessing upon you.\n\n>The goddess of light, Rebecca, honors you for resisting the seven malignant saints' temptation to strengthen God's Command.\n\n>You have acquired 'Skill Enhancement' as compensation.\n\n>**Skill Enhancement**\n>You may strengthen one skill you possess.\n>The skill's power will increase significantly.\n>This applies only to class-specific skills.\n\nClass-specific skills—for Grid, that meant Pagma's Swordsmanship and his various smithing techniques. The exact nature of the enhancement was unclear, but Grid felt a flash of disappointment. He'd hoped for an entirely new skill. He didn't know about Hell Grid's five-fusion technique, but he'd expected at least a four-fusion skill. Was skill enhancement really all he was getting?\n\n*—May blessings follow your heroic path.*\n\nThe goddess's voice began to fade, withdrawing. Grid called out urgently, \"Wait! Goddess!\"\n\nIf they could have a real conversation, then negotiation was possible!\n\n*—What is it?*\n\nAs expected, Rebecca paused. Grid spoke bluntly: \"Help me create fusion skills with more sword dances!\"\n\n*—Huhut.*\n\nThe goddess laughed, understanding immediately. Given their high affinity, she offered a valuable hint: *—That is something only you can pioneer now. Didn't you notice War God Zeratul also supports this blessing?*\n\n\"...What?\"\n\n*—This blessing holds more value than previous ones.*\n\nRebecca said nothing more. The warm light that had made Irene and Lord smile in their sleep vanished as though it had never been. She was gone.\n\nGrid sat alone, pulling up the list of skills eligible for enhancement. All of Pagma's Swordsmanship techniques and his smithing skills appeared under 'Skills That Can Be Enhanced.'\n\n*I can build my own fusion skills... but how?*\n\nHe decided to check what enhancing a single sword dance would do. He started with Link.\n\nThe result was extraordinary.\n\n>**Genuine - Link**\n>Regardless of attack speed, Link will deliver exactly 40 strikes per second. Each strike deals damage equal to 200% of attack power.\n>Link can chain directly into another sword dance.\n>* This enhanced skill is fixed at Master level.\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nGrid's face brightened. Seeing this, he no longer regretted missing out on the enhanced God's Command."
