All your stats rose by 120?\" Toban's eyes widened.\n\nThe former Tzedakah members crowded around Grid, peppering him with questions about the Kingdom's Hero title. For high-level rankers, the bonus was staggering. Most of them possessed at least seven different stat types. One hundred twenty points distributed across seven categories equated to gaining eighty-four levels worth of raw power.\n\nRook let out a low whistle. \"That's almost legendary-grade.\"\n\n\"Makes sense,\" Zednos said. \"A kingdom's hero gets recorded in history. Eventually, they become legends themselves.\"\n\nToban groaned. \"If only we'd joined the war sooner.\"\n\n\"Seriously.\" Pon shook his head. \"Unbelievable.\"\n\nThe guild members who'd arrived late to the battlefield nursed their regret openly. None of them suspected the truth. Grid's legendary class granted him thirteen distinct stat types, not seven.\n\n*1,560 stat points total.* Grid's chest swelled with pride. *I want to tell them so badly.*\n\nHis jaw clenched. The urge to boast clawed at his throat like a living thing.\n\n*No. I have to be careful.*\n\nHe'd made a promise to himself. No more childish behavior. As Overgeared's guild master, he owed his people better than petty one-upmanship.\n\n*Making them feel inferior would be cruel.*\n\nMaturity meant considering others' feelings. Grid swallowed his excitement and shifted topics.\n\n\"Sehee.\" He turned to his sister. \"What happened to you?\"\n\nShe'd only just started playing Satisfy. How had a complete beginner obtained an epic hidden class?\n\n\"It was...\" Sehee's lips pressed into a thin line. She looked away, sulking.\n\nYerim jumped in. \"Let me explain.\" She launched into the story while Sehee stared at the ground.\n\nGrid listened. When Yerim finished, he laughed.\n\n\"That's so like you.\" He shook his head, half-exasperated, half-proud.\n\nSacrificing herself for strangers with zero benefit? Grid couldn't wrap his mind around that kind of selflessness. Part of him worried. Sehee's good nature made her vulnerable. Someone with fewer scruples could exploit that kindness and leave her bleeding.\n\nBut another part of him swelled with pride. His little sister embodied goodness he could never achieve. If she wanted to be kind, he'd protect her right to do so.\n\nHe smiled warmly. Yerim chose that moment to speak up.\n\n\"By the way...\" She fidgeted. \"I also got a hidden class called Saintess' Knight. How do I change to it?\"\n\n\"What?\" Grid's smile froze.\n\nShocked silence rippled through the guild.\n\n*Both of them? Hidden classes at level one?*\n\nPon's mouth hung open. \"What kind of luck is that?\"\n\nZednos rubbed his temples. *If I stay near Grid, maybe I'll unlock good fortune as a real-world stat.*\n\nToban's eyes gleamed. *Buying land next to Grid's building was brilliant. I should move to South Korea immediately.*\n\nLauel's expression brightened like someone had flipped a switch. *I thought the sexy schoolgirl would be dead weight. How wrong I was. Excellent.*\n\nHe stepped forward. \"Let me explain. Class change conditions vary, but generally...\" \n\nLauel walked Yerim through the process. Within minutes, she'd successfully changed to Saintess' Knight.\n\n\"Is this good?\" Yerim studied her stat screen, frowning.\n\nThe base stats were lower than other epic classes. Her newly opened attributes showed moderate to mediocre performance. The active skills seemed disappointingly plain in both power and function.\n\nBut the passives made up for everything. When partied with the Saintess, all skill performance increased by 20%, stats rose by 30%, and resistance jumped by 50%. She also gained 40% of the Saintess' defense value as bonus armor. The class essentially upgraded Huroi's Apostle of Justice's Partner concept.\n\n\"You two should stick together in-game,\" Grid said.\n\nSatisfy would deepen their friendship. Grid felt grateful Sehee had such a loyal best friend. Recent experiences had taught him the value of genuine companionship.\n\nThe party reached the junction between Winston and Bairan before he realized it.\n\nLauel pointed at Jishuka. \"You say goodbye here. Continue ruling Bairan as you have been.\"\n\nJishuka's face fell. \"Shouldn't I stay near Grid to support him? Can't someone else handle Bairan so I can go to Reidan?\"\n\n\"Name one guild member capable of managing a city as well as you.\"\n\nJishuka was their only proven administrator. They needed her experience desperately.\n\n\"The others will start with small villages. They'll gain lord experience gradually. Once they're ready, we'll find your successor. Until then...\" Lauel spread his hands. \"Please endure.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" Jishuka's shoulders slumped.\n\n\"Don't forget to stockpile minerals in the guild warehouse. Keep raiding the Guardian of the Forest on schedule.\"\n\n\"I understand.\" Her voice carried zero enthusiasm.\n\nJishuka selected three guild members to assist her. She prepared to leave wearing a bleak expression. Then Lauel dangled bait.\n\n\"Want to swear a knight's oath to Grid before you go? He could summon you anytime he needs you.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Jishuka's head snapped up.\n\nFlying to Grid's side regardless of distance? She didn't hesitate.\n\nThe oath took seconds. System messages flashed:\n\n> [You have become the knight of Duke Grid of the Eternal Kingdom.]  \n> [Grid can summon you to his side at any time, assuming that you agree.]\n\n\"Hehe, I'll be going then.\" Jishuka's energy returned in full force. She headed toward Bairan with her three helpers.\n\nLauel called after her. \"Also, keep searching for talent. Try to recruit three promising knights. Don't neglect soldier recruitment either.\"\n\nEvery knight and soldier would bolster Grid's military strength. Jishuka nodded and departed.\n\nThe remaining guild members traveled to Winston with Grid.\n\n***\n\n\"Husband!\" Irene intercepted Grid's group as they entered Winston.\n\nShe ignored the watching crowd and threw herself into Grid's arms. Her face glowed with joy.\n\n\"Thank you for coming back safely! Thank you for helping Father! Thank you for protecting the kingdom!\" She squeezed him tighter. \"I'm so proud you've become a duke!\"\n\nIrene buried her face in his chest. Grid stroked her silver hair, his expression softening. Then he glanced back.\n\nSehee and Yerim stared at him.\n\n*Why do they look angry?*\n\nGrid cleared his throat. \"This is my wife.\"\n\n\"...\" Sehee's eyes narrowed.\n\nYerim's jaw clenched.\n\nBoth girls knew Grid had married an NPC. It was common knowledge, given his father-in-law was Marquis Steim. But knowing intellectually and seeing the reality firsthand created different emotional responses.\n\n*Our parents don't know he's married in-game.* Sehee's thoughts darkened. *This makes him look terrible.*\n\n*I want to win Youngwoo first,* Yerim thought fiercely.\n\nIrene noticed their hostile stares. Her face paled. \"Husband, have you taken concubines already? Now that you're a duke...\" Her voice cracked. \"My heart aches.\"\n\n\"It's not like that. They're...\"\n\nNo time for explanations. Sehee and Yerim erupted.\n\n\"Who's his concubine?!\" Sehee's face flushed red.\n\n\"I'm not some concubine!\" Yerim jabbed a finger at Irene. \"I'll be his legal wife!\"\n\nThe confrontation spiraled. Sehee looked genuinely confused about the situation escalating so quickly. Yerim directed her words straight at Irene.\n\n\"This is a game world, not reality. So we can get married too.\" She crossed her arms. \"I don't want that, but if he asked me...\" She faltered. \"Uh.\"\n\n\"You're Youngwoo's wife with that body?\" Yerim's lip curled. \"Did you use magic or something?\"\n\n\"Oh my.\" Irene's perfectly composed mask cracked. \"What nonsense is this fox spouting?\"\n\n*I'm exhausted.* Grid sighed. He checked the time. Seven PM in the real world. Six hours had passed in reality, eighteen in-game, since the kan jajang delivery arrived.\n\nGrid physically stepped between the girls and Irene.\n\n\"You should log out. Even though it's Saturday, your parents will worry if you're home late.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Yerim's eyes widened.\n\nSo much had happened since logging in. The golem army battle. The banquet. The journey north. Event after event had consumed their attention, making them lose track of time.\n\n\"It's already this late?\" Sehee checked her internal clock.\n\nThe girls prepared to disconnect. Before logging out, though, they approached Grid separately.\n\n\"Today's money.\" Sehee pulled up her inventory. \"I'll give it to you.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" Yerim added.\n\nBoth girls were only eighteen years old. Five hundred thousand gold was an enormous sum to them. Converting that to five hundred million won made it feel unreal. Frightening, even.\n\nGrid understood. He accepted the 442,900 gold Sehee received from the 'Fight the Golems' quest. But he refused Yerim's payment.\n\n\"I'll manage Sehee's money and return it when she's an adult.\" He held up a hand. \"But Yerim, that's your money. If you want, I can exchange it for cash and give it to your parents.\"\n\nYerim stuck out her tongue. \"Why are you acting like this? Take my money too. Later, use it to make me an item. The guild members told me your creations are expensive.\"\n\nLauel pushed the hesitant Grid forward. \"Accept it. Manage Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl's capital until they level up, then craft them equipment. It benefits the guild.\"\n\nGrid finally nodded. Sehee and Yerim confirmed the transaction and logged out.\n\nThe chaos settled.\n\n\"Irene.\" Grid took her hands. \"I need to leave for a while.\"\n\nIrene's face crumpled. \"Are you going to Reidan immediately?\"\n\nTears welled in her beautiful eyes. She didn't want separation. Grid's chest tightened watching her look like a rain-soaked puppy, but necessity overruled sentiment.\n\n\"Someday we'll travel together.\"\n\n\"...\" \n\nIrene wanted to beg him not to leave. Or to demand she accompany him. But she had responsibilities as a marquis' heir. Grid's position as a newly appointed duke came with obligations too. Perhaps the future would offer different circumstances.\n\n\"Before you go...\" Irene pulled Grid close. She ignored the watching soldiers, knights, and guild members. She kissed him deeply, then declared, \"I want to conceive a child with you tonight.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nSpeaking so explicitly in public? The embarrassed Grid's face turned scarlet. Everyone else suddenly found the sky fascinating. They coughed. Whistled. Studied their boots.\n\nIrene's gaze didn't waver. She meant every word.\n\nGrid fell under the spell of her sincerity and beauty.\n\n\"I understand.\" His voice roughened. \"I'll do my best.\"\n\nThey retreated to the bedroom. Grid's large, calloused fingers traced patterns across Irene's silky skin...\n\n*[Further details omitted.]*\n\n\"Ahh, husband...\" Irene gasped as Grid moved deeper than ever...\n\n*[Omitted.]*\n\n***\n\nWhile Grid and Irene occupied themselves, Lauel headed for the dungeon.\n\nShay's party had been imprisoned there for three days. Lauel made his offer to the sullen prisoners.\n\n\"Give me your most expensive item. In exchange, I guarantee your freedom and safety.\"\n\nShay snorted. \"We'll be released in three hours anyway. Why should we?\"\n\nHuroi's previous situation was an exception. Normally, even serious crimes couldn't keep a user imprisoned beyond three days. Shay's group knew this better than anyone. They laughed at Lauel's proposal.\n\nLauel regarded them with cold eyes. \"Let me clarify. Give me an item, or I kill you. If you have functioning eyes and ears, you know I possess that power.\"\n\n\"What...?\" The laughter died.\n\nPK users like Shay's party had high item drop rates upon death. Lauel pulled out a sheet of paper while they processed the threat. Irene had provided the inventory list.\n\n\"This details every item you currently own. Hand over your most expensive and precious possession.\" His smile didn't reach his eyes. \"Then I'll spare your lives.\"\n\n\"This is...\" Shay's face went pale.\n\nThe assassins found it absurd. This young man called Lauel possessed the same ruthlessness they'd used threatening countless victims. Shay's party silently vowed never to cross Grid again.\n\nMeanwhile, Grid finished his precious time with Irene. He summoned Euphemina.\n\n\"Do you remember Rabbit?\"\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**  \n**OG: Glossary Link.**  \n**Current schedule: 20 chapters a week.**  \n**Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
