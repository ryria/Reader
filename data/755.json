But with eighteen events still ahead across the next two days, the rankings remained fluid. Even Russia, last year's champion, had yet to make their mark.\n\n\"Nine events today,\" the lead commentator announced. \"Six of them team-based. This is the most critical day of the entire Competition.\"\n\n\"Team events require roster depth,\" his colleague added. \"The United States, Canada, China, Russia—they have the numbers. Other nations? Their medal prospects drop significantly.\"\n\n\"So whichever of the four dominates the team events will claim the overall crown.\"\n\n\"The question is: will Russia repeat? Can the United States reclaim their inaugural title? Will Canada finally convert potential into results? Or might China become the first Asian nation to take gold?\"\n\n\"Russia's chances look grim without Kraugel. Alexander is exceptional, but the supporting cast is substantially weaker.\"\n\n\"Agreed. They're aiming for top ten—secure the country buff. If Knight had entered, maybe... but he's sitting this one out.\"\n\n\"What about France? Third place in the inaugural Competition?\"\n\n\"Bondre declined to participate after the Seven Guilds collapsed. France is a non-factor.\"\n\nThe consensus settled around the United States, Canada, and China—the expected trilogy. The commentary team exchanged rueful smiles.\n\n\"It's unfortunate South Korea isn't even in the conversation. Second place in both previous Competitions.\"\n\n\"Their success came when the event count was limited. But this year's Competition has twenty-seven events. Grid might secure two individual golds, but Korea lacks the depth for a podium finish overall. Look at today's roster—they're only fielding teams in two of six group events, and the participants are complete unknowns.\"\n\n\"They seem to have accepted their limitations.\"\n\n\"The vibe is 'just happy to be here.'\"\n\nSouth Korea's player pool was notoriously shallow. Beyond Grid and Yura, their roster thinned considerably.\n\n\"Yura might add another medal. Grid could medal in tomorrow's PvP and Blacksmithing events. But that's the ceiling.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I question whether Grid can take gold. The new Blacksmithing rules don't favor him, and in PvP? Kraugel stands in his way.\"\n\n---\n\n**Korean Team Waiting Room**\n\n\"They talk too much.\"\n\nEat Spicy Jokbal's jaw clenched as he adjusted his gear for the Subjugation Expedition. The commentators' dismissiveness stoked something fierce in his chest.\n\nViola laughed—a fox-like expression stretching her narrow face beneath her traditional hanbok. \"Can you blame them? South Korea *is* weak.\"\n\n\"We *were* weak,\" Eat Spicy Jokbal corrected, eyes glinting. \"Past tense. That ended the moment we entered the field.\"\n\nOfficial ranker status brought wealth and fame, true—but also scrutiny and restrictions. That's why he, Viola, and Ma Bongshik had operated in the shadows for years. But now they'd chosen to step into the light. If they were making an entrance, it wouldn't be halfhearted.\n\n\"My debut needs to be *spectacular*,\" he muttered. \"Like a certain someone's was.\"\n\nHis gaze drifted toward Grid. Grid met his eyes and said simply, \"Bring back gold.\"\n\n\"We'll bring back two.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe younger Korean players exchanged skeptical glances. Who was this guy with the ridiculous username, acting so confident? But Grid's expectations were high. He knew exactly who stood before him.\n\n*The master of Blood Carnival.*\n\nEat Spicy Jokbal had built and commanded the strongest—and most notorious—dark gaming organization in Satisfy. Grid respected the power of his hidden class, Dungeon Maker. He and Peak Sword both anticipated the shockwave his reveal would send through the community.\n\n---\n\n**Arena Chat Explodes**\n\n[Eat Spicy Jokbal? That ID is REAL?]\n\n[No way. What kind of name... ㅋㅋㅋ]\n\n[That's even worse than a twelve-year-old's gamertag]\n\n[Dude really loves his pork trotters, I guess]\n\nThe Subjugation Expedition combined raiding with PvP—three nations entered simultaneously to hunt a boss monster while simultaneously checking each other's progress. Whichever country dealt the most cumulative damage to the boss won gold.\n\nToday's target: a cockatrice. One tier below a drake—strong, but not overwhelming. The S.A. Group had calibrated the difficulty deliberately. If the boss was too powerful, teams would cooperate instead of competing. This way, the event would be fast-paced and cutthroat.\n\n\"First opponents are Korea and Japan,\" a Russian player smirked. \"We lucked out.\"\n\nGroup A featured South Korea, Japan, and Russia. The Russians considered it excellent matchmaking. Korea was a two-person team outside of Grid and Yura—neither of whom were competing in this event. The Korean roster was filled with nobodies. Japan wasn't much better; Damian and Katz were absent, leaving only mid-tier rankers.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, had Alexander—the nation's strongest active competitor after the rising Knight. Last year, Alexander had partnered with Kraugel to secure Russia's overall championship.\n\n\"Our goal is gold,\" Alexander stated. \"We start by dominating this match.\"\n\nThe previous four team events had shaken up the standings. The United States had failed to capture a single gold medal. Canada claimed three; China took one. That meant America had fallen behind. If Russia could sweep the remaining two team events, they might vault into first place overall. Motivation ran high.\n\n\"Listen up.\"\n\nThree minutes before the boss spawn, Alexander turned toward his protégé. Ikonikoski—once Alexander's equal in skill—hurried over.\n\n\"Korea and Japan will likely panic and form an alliance,\" Alexander said. \"We eliminate the Koreans immediately. Don't give them time to coordinate with Japan.\"\n\nIkonikoski could handle three nobodies alone without breaking a sweat. He grinned confidently.\n\n\"Got it! I'll crush those yellow monk—*urk!*\"\n\nAlexander's palm cracked against the back of his skull.\n\n\"Don't be racist,\" Alexander said, voice cold.\n\n\"Wh—what...?\"\n\nIkonikoski stammered. Alexander—a notorious *skinhead*—was lecturing him about racism? The world had turned upside down.\n\n\"Kraugel is Korean, you idiot!\"\n\n\"I—I'm sorry! I didn't know!\"\n\nIkonikoski's apology came out strangled. He hadn't realized Alexander had become a devoted Kraugel fanboy. Fear kept him from questioning it further.\n\n---\n\n**South Korean Team Staging Area**\n\n\"Our first opponents are pathetic,\" Eat Spicy Jokbal muttered. \"Shouldn't my debut be against someone like Kraugel, at minimum?\"\n\nHe'd planned this reveal meticulously. He wanted his entrance to be *memorable*—to burn his name into the minds of the global audience. Instead, he'd drawn Russia.\n\nMa Bongshik clapped his shoulder. \"Alexander's fairly famous. Could be worse.\"\n\n\"Mm... I suppose.\"\n\nNothing for it now. Eat Spicy Jokbal surveyed the battlefield—a wasteland cut by a steep canyon. Dust devils whipped through the ravine. At the summit, the cockatrice roosted.\n\n*Whoever reaches the top first accumulates the most damage. It's a race.*\n\nWith flight magic disabled in the zone, the question became: who could scale the sheer canyon walls fastest?\n\n*And we'll need to fend off interference from the other teams.*\n\nHis gaze shifted toward the cave entrance at the canyon's base.\n\n\"Perfect terrain for a dungeon summon.\"\n\nA Dungeon Maker's strength amplified when deploying crafted dungeons into suitable terrain. Eat Spicy Jokbal had built dozens of custom dungeons—enough variety to handle almost any scenario.\n\n\"We're heading for that cave,\" he said.\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nViola and Ma Bongshik moved with him. While the Russian and Japanese rankers charged toward the canyon summit, the Korean team angled toward the cave entrance.\n\n---\n\n**Commentator's Booth**\n\n\"...What?\"\n\n\"Are they—are they seriously hiding?\"\n\nThe moment the Subjugation Expedition began, confusion rippled through the commentary team. Instead of engaging monsters or racing toward the boss, the Korean players had ducked into the cave and... stopped.\n\n\"I can't see any strategic value in this. They must be panicking.\"\n\nThe narrative formed quickly: the Koreans had frozen under pressure. Realizing they couldn't compete, they'd chosen the coward's path—*hiding*.\n\nThe Russian rankers reached the same conclusion.\n\n\"Worthless.\"\n\nAlexander shook his head in disbelief. The Koreans were cowering in a cave out of fear.\n\n\"Ikonikoski, ignore them. Focus on beating the Japanese team to the summit.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\nThe Russian squad moved with disciplined efficiency. As they climbed, they steadily closed the gap with the Japanese climbers. The cockatrice was still pecking at sand atop the plateau—oblivious. It seemed inevitable that Russia would reach the boss first, eliminate Japan, and claim an easy victory.\n\nThen everything changed.\n\n**Kyao?**\n\nThe cockatrice's head snapped downward. Its sharp, predatory eyes locked onto the cave entrance—where the Koreans were hidden.\n\n**KYAOOOOH!**\n\nThe monster shrieked. Its powerful legs coiled—and then it *leaped* off the plateau, ignoring the Russian and Japanese climbers entirely.\n\n\"What?!\"\n\nShock rippled through both teams. They'd been climbing for minutes—and now the boss was diving *down* toward the hidden Koreans?\n\n\"Chase it!\"\n\nPanic set in. Even if the Korean players were nobodies, they were still level 250-plus. Three of them could deal substantial damage before Russia could intervene. The rankers scrambled to reverse course, but the canyon walls were too steep. The cockatrice's descent was exponentially faster than their climb.\n\nThe monster plunged into the cave.\n\n\"Hey! Damn chicken-brain! Stop!\"\n\nAlexander's shout echoed uselessly.\n\n**Thud!**\n\nThe cockatrice vanished into the darkness.\n\nFor a heartbeat, nothing.\n\nThen—\n\n\"Chicken sounds good right about now.\"\n\n**SLASH!**\n\nEat Spicy Jokbal's blade erupted from the shadows, carving through the cockatrice's flank.\n\nDozens of cameras swiveled away from the Russian climbers—and locked onto the cave entrance.\n\nThe world's attention focused on a single man."
