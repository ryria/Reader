  "content": "The opening exchanges erupted with savage intensity—though only Grid's side felt it. Every parry, every desperate counter revealed more of their capabilities to Limit, and with each revelation, the Sword Duke adapted. His blade flowed like a raging river: relentless, ever-shifting, drowning anyone who blinked. One moment of inattention would sweep them all away.\n\n\"Hah... hah...\"\n\nAfter countless exchanges, Coke and Resh had retreated behind their shields, hunched like turtles withdrawn into their shells. Grid fared little better. Unlike his companions, he still pressed forward with his sword raised—but he could only defend, and barely at that. Each time he sought an opening to counterattack, Limit's unfamiliar technique sealed it off before he could strike.\n\nIt felt like fighting with his limbs bound. Like being trapped inside a punching bag.\n\n*Three against one, and he's toying with us.*\n\nSword Duke. The pinnacle above Great Swordsman, one step below Sword Saint. In theory, Kraugel stood higher—but theory meant nothing here. The current Sword Saint remained incomplete, still climbing toward his peak. Limit had already arrived at his.\n\nAt this moment, the Sword Duke eclipsed the Sword Saint.\n\n\"Kugh!\"\n\nAnother slash opened Grid's shoulder. Red flooded his vision as blood—mostly his own—painted the arena floor. Yet he didn't despair. His mind remained clear, fixed on the sliver of hope his insight stat provided. Over two thousand points of perception, constantly analyzing, constantly learning.\n\n**[Insight]**  \n**Discover the target. Predict risks.**  \n**The higher the number, the higher the probability.**\n\nThe description seemed sparse, almost useless. But Grid knew better. He'd witnessed insight's power countless times before. The longer he observed a target, the more its patterns crystallized in his mind. Each second of observation fed his perception, sharpening it until—\n\n*There.*\n\nMinutes had passed. Or perhaps only seconds—time distorted when every breath might be your last. But Grid finally saw it. The microscopic tells in Limit's shoulders. The infinitesimal shift in weight before each strike. For the first time, Grid's blade met Limit's not through desperation but prediction. No luck involved. Pure insight and agility guiding his counter.\n\nLimit's eyes narrowed. \"...?\"\n\nThe tide shifted. Grid began intercepting more strikes, launching calculated counters rather than flailing blocks. Coke and Resh surged forward to capitalize on the momentum. No longer could Limit dominate all three simultaneously. The high rankers moved like veterans who'd fought together for years, their coordination seamless despite only just meeting.\n\nForced onto the defensive, Limit retreated behind a curtain of slashes. Blood dripped from his left arm—the first wound Grid had landed.\n\n\"You've already dissected my swordsmanship.\" Genuine surprise colored his voice. \"Hundreds of variations, and you've mapped them all. Truly a genius. No wonder Rigal and Diworth fell.\"\n\nThroughout the battle, Limit had prioritized one objective: preventing Grid's sword dances. By desperately intercepting those devastating techniques, he'd maintained his advantage despite fighting three opponents. But that advantage was evaporating. Now that Grid had adapted, Limit couldn't suppress both warriors *and* counter sword dances.\n\nHis stance shifted. \"One.\"\n\nWhere before he'd gripped the sword's center with the tip angled downward, he now grasped the pommel's base and leveled the blade horizontally.\n\n\"I'll acknowledge your talent properly. With a different style.\"\n\n\"What—?\"\n\nThe stab came too fast to see.\n\n***\n\n**[The target has received 24,500 damage.]**\n\n**[You have suffered 7,800 damage.]**\n\n**[The target has defended against your attack.]**\n\n**[You have been struck with a critical blow!]**\n\n**[Half of the damage suffered has been transferred to party member 'Resh'. You have suffered 6,950 damage.]**\n\n**[Party member 'Coke' has blocked the attack!]**\n\n\"Excellent—!\"\n\n**[You have suffered 6,330 damage!]**\n\n\"Damn it! How rotten is my luck?!\"\n\nHe'd lost count of how many times he'd been knocked down. Limit's flowing water style had vanished, replaced by a boxer's relentless jabs—short, brutal thrusts that came in machine-gun bursts. Each one triggered knockback. Lower strikes caused knock-downs. The swordsmanship was maddening.\n\nGrid was pushed. Grid fell. His body slammed into dirt and stone so many times that he resembled a beggar covered in filth and blood.\n\n*This is infuriating.*\n\nJust when he'd adapted to one style, Limit shifted to another. Like a raid boss entering its second phase. Did such shameless opponents exist?\n\nGrid forced his expression blank and downed a potion without letting his hands shake. Current health: 53,097. Between Coke and Resh's assistance and the absorption effects of Elfin Stone's Ring and Doran's Ring, he'd maintained above fifty thousand.\n\nWhich meant death wasn't imminent—not from normal attacks. Limit's ultimate technique remained the wildcard, but ultimates required obvious wind-ups. Large enough motions for Grid to interrupt with a sword dance.\n\nThey hadn't lost yet.\n\nBut for how long could this balance hold? Stamina posed the real threat.\n\n*If this continues, we'll be crushed through attrition.*\n\nYet rushing provided no solution. Even with insight's assistance, adapting to this new style would take time. And the truly frustrating part? Once he overcame this technique, Limit might simply unveil a third style. Or a fourth.\n\n*There's no way he's shown everything.*\n\nGrid needed an opening for a four-fusion sword dance. Limit's total health sat below fifty million. One clean hit with a properly executed fusion technique could reverse everything.\n\n\"...!\"\n\nThe thought shattered as Limit's shoulders twitched. Grid abandoned all contemplation and raised his blade on pure reflex. The collision sent shockwaves through his arms. In raw speed, Grid surpassed Limit. If he could detect attacks early—like just now—his defense rate skyrocketed.\n\nThe problem was *detecting* them.\n\n*As expected.*\n\nGrid's fingers went numb from the impact. Limit's attack power was climbing. Without Triple Layers' damage reduction against thrusts and slashes, without Lantier's Cloak supplementing his defense, Grid would have shattered already. Even with Coke and Resh splitting damage, the balance would have collapsed.\n\n*In the end, items are the answer.*\n\nLimit wasn't just a technician. He hadn't transcended human limits or ascended beyond mortality's threshold. That's why Grid could match his speed. But every other stat? Limit dominated. Grid's only advantages were velocity and equipment. Velocity that Limit's technique currently suppressed, preventing full exploitation.\n\nWhich left equipment.\n\nAnd Grid regretted lending Iyarugt to Peak Sword more with each passing second.\n\n*With Iyarugt, this would be possible.*\n\nThat sword was devastating. Beyond summoning Sword Demon Iyarugt himself, it crippled enemy healing, maximized combo potential, and revealed the optimal sword path for any situation. In every metric that mattered, Iyarugt excelled. Particularly that last function—the ability to perceive the perfect sword path—would be invaluable here.\n\nSo what if Limit had mastered his techniques? Iyarugt had crossed blades with Great Demons. The ego dwelling in that weapon would dissect Limit's patterns and expose every weakness.\n\n*Wait.*\n\nGrid's thoughts accelerated. Item Transformation. The skill that reshaped pavranium into any item he understood. He needed the production method memorized, but after wielding Iyarugt for years? Grid's understanding had long since reached one hundred percent.\n\n*Transform Blade Aiming at the Gods into Iyarugt, then combine it with the Enlightenment Sword...*\n\nThe damage would be guaranteed. And he'd gain access to Iyarugt's path-finding ability. Continuing this losing battle served no purpose. The moment a solution appeared, he had to seize it.\n\nGrid rolled to his feet after another knock-down and roared, \"Item—!\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Trans—formation!\"\n\n**[What item do you want to turn the pavranium into?]**\n\nThe notification materialized.\n\n\"What are you planning?!\" Limit sensed danger and surged forward with murderous intent. For the first time in the battle, he completely ignored Coke and Resh, focusing every ounce of killing intent on Grid alone. His thrusts became a torrential downpour.\n\nGrid's vision exploded crimson. Blood sprayed from new wounds as he simultaneously dodged, activated the Pulling Device, and navigated the system prompt. Blade Aiming at the Gods separated from the Enlightenment Sword's handle.\n\n\"Noe!\"\n\n\"Nyong! Become Majestic!\"\n\n**[Become Majestic (SSS)]**\n\n**[Hell's best demonic beast, Memphis, has pushed the thunder stone's power to its limit. A lightning shield that blocks all attacks will manifest for two seconds.**  \n**Cooldown: 30 minutes.**  \n**The user will become drained for one minute after activation.]**\n\n\"—?!\"\n\nLimit twisted mid-strike as the lightning barrier erupted between them. Years of experience let him instantly recognize its nature. He pivoted toward his ultimate technique, knowing the shield would fade quickly. Time to end this farce.\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\n\"Don't ignore us!\"\n\nCoke and Resh charged to interrupt the casting, but Limit's defensive sword curtain repelled them effortlessly. Light particles coalesced at his blade's tip, growing brighter as Noe's shield flickered. The situation spiraled toward catastrophe.\n\nGrid aimed the Blade Aiming at the Gods forward and shouted: \"Iyarugt!\"\n\nDeclaring his target. Pavranium erupted with golden light, form shifting and flowing. The blade became translucent gold. Grid burned through his remaining Divinity charges and activated Item Combination.\n\n**[The Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has successfully combined with Iyarugt (Transformed)!]**\n\nThe result: a black-gold transparent blade wreathed in dark flames and crackling azure lightning. Nature's fury condensed into steel.\n\n\"Impossible!\" Dwarf Ke gasped at the weapon's manifestation.\n\n\"So... tired... nyang...\" Noe collapsed, his small body hitting the cold stone. The lightning shield vanished simultaneously.\n\n\"You've run out of chances.\" Limit, already prepared, swung. Hundreds of thousands of light particles erupted like the Milky Way made flesh, cascading toward Grid in a stellar avalanche.\n\nGrid clung to desperate hope. If combining Iyarugt with the Enlightenment Sword granted access to the optimal sword path—\n\n\"...?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nIyarugt's ego didn't whisper guidance. The sword path remained hidden.\n\n*No...!* \n\nIce flooded Grid's veins. He'd overlooked the fundamental truth about Iyarugt. The weapon's true power didn't reside in its physical form but in the *ego* inhabiting it. Item Transformation only replicated the blade's shape. It couldn't duplicate Iyarugt's consciousness.\n\nThe stellar explosion engulfed him. Grid's health—already depleted during the transformation process—plummeted to zero.\n\n**[A legend doesn't die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]**\n\nImmortality triggered. His final lifeline activated. Could he turn the tide in five seconds when Limit's patterns still eluded complete comprehension? Impossible.\n\nHe'd lost.\n\nGrid's head bowed as despair and frustration crashed over him.\n\n*...No.*\n\nHis mind ignited. Crisis had always forged him stronger, and this moment crystallized that potential into something sharper. Limit continued his assault. Grid collapsed once more, blood-soaked fingers crawling toward his sword.\n\n\"Granting... an Ego...\"\n\nThe hidden reward from conquering the Behen Archipelago. An irreversible action, never before used.\n\n**[The soul of Sword Demon Iyarugt has entered your weapon.]**\n\n\"—?!\" \n\nLimit froze like a statue. His heart—convinced of certain victory—was pierced by Grid's blade."
