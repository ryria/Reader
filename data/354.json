But it contains a curse. The owner will be followed by Bunhelier's Gaze.*\n\n*The great demon Drasion sealed a portion of the sword's power to avoid this gaze, but the legendary blacksmith Grid released the seal.*\n\n**Weight:** 887\n\n---\n\n**[Heart Selection]**\n\nPassive.\n\nWhen striking at the target's heart (including both normal and skill attacks), there is a normal chance that double the damage will be dealt. There is also a low chance of instantly killing the opponent.\n\n**Resources Consumed:** None.  \n**Skill Cooldown Time:** None.\n\n---\n\n**[Bunhelier's Gaze]**\n\nCurse.\n\nThe evil dragon Bunhelier is always watching over you.\n\nYou might be attacked on a day when Bunhelier is feeling grumpy.\n\n**Skill Activation Condition:** Random.\n\n---\n\n> [Information about 'Bunhelier's Fang' used to make the item has been obtained!]\n> [The skill proficiency of (Understanding of Gods' Weapons) Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship Skill has increased by 10%.]\n\n*Amazing.*\n\nGrid's pulse quickened. Legendary skills had always carried a persistent burden. The long cooldown times and resource consumption were bad enough, but the real problem lay deeper. They leveled at a glacial pace.\n\nThe Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship Skill was no exception. Three years in Satisfy. Three years of grinding, forging, and refining. Countless hours at the anvil. All of it had only pushed the skill to level seven.\n\nThe mathematics were cruel. After hitting level seven, each <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Unique</span> rated item he crafted granted a meager 1% experience. One percent. For items that took hours to produce.\n\nBut this? Ten percent. Just from analyzing a new material.\n\nDragon bone. The word alone carried weight.\n\n*Worth every second.*\n\nGrid exhaled slowly. But his satisfaction didn't end there. The appraisal results themselves were staggering. Attack power and durability had jumped by 100 and 200 respectively. A new option materialized where none existed before.\n\n*If this is what happens to White Fang...*\n\nHis thoughts drifted to Iyarugt. The ego sword currently sat at <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Unique</span> rating, but it possessed growth potential. If it reached <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Legendary</span>, what would it become?\n\nThe Heart Selection skill in particular drew his attention. For Kraugel, it would be devastating. The man's control was inhuman. Surgical. He could strike a specific point on command, transforming a passive skill into an execution tool.\n\nThen Grid's eyes landed on the final line of text.\n\nHis face went pale.\n\n*A cursed item?*\n\nThe performance boost meant nothing if it came with a noose. White Fang had improved, yes. But now it carried surveillance. Potential attack. From a dragon.\n\n*I screwed up.*\n\nThe realization hit like a hammer blow. He'd meant to help Kraugel. To repay him for the spar, for the experience. Instead, he'd handed him a ticking bomb.\n\nGrid swallowed hard.\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\nKraugel's voice cut through the silence. His eyes tracked Grid's expression, reading the drain of color from his face. Something was wrong.\n\nHe reached out and took White Fang from Grid's hands. His eyes scanned the item window.\n\nThen he froze.\n\nThe air between them grew thick. Neither man spoke. The smithy's ambient sounds seemed to fade, leaving only the weight of unspoken words.\n\nGrid broke first.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" The words came out rough. Grid forced himself to meet Kraugel's gaze. \"I am ashamed.\"\n\nHe'd changed. The old Grid would have made excuses, deflected blame, shifted responsibility. But he was Lord of Reidan now. Master of Overgeared. Father to Lord.\n\nHe had standards to uphold.\n\n\"I'm really sorry. It wasn't maliciously done.\" Grid's jaw tightened. \"Give me time and I will return the item to its original state.\"\n\nKraugel remained still, White Fang balanced in his palm. Then his voice emerged, trembling with something Grid couldn't identify.\n\n\"Amazing.\"\n\nGrid blinked. \"What?\"\n\n\"Seeing the hidden abilities of an item and drawing them out...\" Kraugel looked up, and his expression carried genuine wonder. \"You truly are a legendary blacksmith. Among the two billion users, you're the only one who can do this.\"\n\nHe turned the blade, light catching the edge.\n\n\"It is truly amazing.\"\n\nGrid felt unmoored. How many users could impress the 1st ranker? You could count them on two hands. Maybe one. Yet here was Kraugel, offering praise without reservation.\n\nThe blade whistled through the air. Once. Twice. Kraugel tested the weight, the balance.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"But...\" Grid's confusion mounted. This wasn't the reaction he'd anticipated. \"The curse...\"\n\nKraugel's lips quirked upward. \"Thanks to you, I can now own the best item.\"\n\nIt wasn't flattery. Kraugel's tone carried conviction. The True White Fang's performance had jumped dramatically. And the Heart Selection skill opened possibilities he'd already started calculating.\n\n*I will become two, no three times stronger than before.*\n\nThe mathematics were simple. Heart Selection required precision. Precision was his specialty. Other users might struggle to proc the passive consistently. For Kraugel, it would be as natural as breathing.\n\n\"That...\" Grid fumbled for words. \"Is it okay? There's a curse.\"\n\nKraugel laughed. Actually laughed.\n\n\"You were worried about that?\" He shook his head. \"You don't have to worry about Bunhelier. I remember a verse from the folk song of the Trempet people. 'Evil dragon, a hero sealed it 500 years ago.' It is highly unlikely that Bunhelier will appear at this time.\"\n\n*Where is Trempet?*\n\nGrid kept the question internal. Most users explored Satisfy organically, wandering the continents and absorbing local culture. Grid's experience was different. More focused. He'd spent years effectively landlocked in the Eternal Kingdom.\n\nRural villages and their folklore hadn't been priorities.\n\n*And he remembers folk songs?*\n\nThe contrast struck Grid. He played Satisfy with tunnel vision, missing details in pursuit of larger goals. Kraugel operated differently. Sharp. Observant. He absorbed information like a sponge, cataloging even minor details.\n\nA folk song from a remote village in a kingdom called Trempet. Of course he remembered it.\n\n\"So.\" Kraugel's voice shifted to business. \"What is the price I have to pay?\"\n\nGrid hesitated.\n\nThe thing he wanted most was obvious. Recruit Kraugel. Bring the 1st ranker into Overgeared. The strategic value alone would be immeasurable.\n\nBut he couldn't say it.\n\nKraugel had maintained solo status for years despite his ranking. Despite countless offers. The pattern was clear. He valued independence. Forcing the issue would only push him away.\n\n*Think.*\n\nGrid's growth wasn't just about stats and items. He'd learned to read people. To respect boundaries.\n\n\"Tell me how to get to the East Continent.\"\n\nKraugel's shoulders relaxed. \"Good.\"\n\nThe response was immediate. Kraugel had been carrying weight since the spar. Damage to Reidan's territory during his bout with Piaro. Grid's protection of his experience. Now the White Fang upgrade.\n\nThe debts had accumulated. Sharing this information would balance the scales.\n\nThe value was substantial. Grid didn't know it yet, but the route to the East Continent required at least a year of continental exploration. Knowledge gathered from dozens of sources, aligned like puzzle pieces.\n\n\"There is an archipelago in the sea south of the Sea Kingdom Media called Behen.\" Kraugel's tone shifted to lecture mode. \"It is an archipelago made up of a total of 66 small islands.\"\n\nGrid leaned in, absorbing every word.\n\nKraugel's eyes glinted with challenge. \"There is a sage present somewhere called Sticks. If you find him, you will be able to move to the East Continent.\"\n\n\"Find him?\" Grid caught the implication. \"Are you saying that he's hiding in a place that is hard to find?\"\n\n\"The Behen Archipelago is a very dangerous place. You have to cross 66 islands one after another.\" Kraugel's expression turned serious. \"A few high rankers became frustrated and couldn't even pass the 10th island. And Sticks usually lives on the 25th to 29th islands.\"\n\n\"Media... Behen... Sticks...\"\n\nGrid pulled out a notebook. His hand moved quickly, transcribing the information. Kraugel watched him write, and something like excitement flickered across his face.\n\n*What island can he reach?*\n\nKraugel's own limit was the 30th island. A wall that even he couldn't overcome. Most users considered it the practical ceiling of current player capability.\n\nBut Grid had defeated him. Not cleanly, not without help, but he'd won nonetheless.\n\n*Maybe he can push further.*\n\nMaybe Grid would extract something greater from Sticks. Some reward or knowledge beyond Kraugel's reach.\n\n*I am looking forward to it.*\n\nThe ridicule Grid had endured. The years spent dismissed as talentless, as gear-dependent. Kraugel wanted to see him rise above it. Wanted Grid to grow and, in doing so, push Kraugel himself to new heights.\n\nIt was the truest desire of someone who'd finally found a worthy rival.\n\n***\n\n\"Why is it so bustling?\"\n\nGrid emerged from the smithy with Kraugel beside him, tools put away and repairs complete. He stopped short.\n\nThe entire Overgeared Guild had assembled outside. Jishuka. Lauel. Regas. Pon. Vantner. Even the secondary members crowded the edges.\n\nEvery eye fixed on Kraugel.\n\nTheir intention radiated like heat. *Join us. Be one of us.*\n\nGrid's stomach sank.\n\n*I failed them.*\n\nAs leader of Overgeared, he'd promised to recruit the 1st ranker. The expectation hung in the air, unspoken but undeniable. And he couldn't deliver.\n\nGuilt twisted in his gut. Grid turned to Kraugel, forcing casualness into his voice.\n\n\"How is it? Do you want to have a meal with us?\"\n\nKraugel's expression shifted. Complicated.\n\nThe spar had changed things. Grid's liking for Kraugel had grown. The feeling was mutual. Kraugel genuinely wanted friendship with Grid. Believed they could help each other improve.\n\nBut the crowd was too much. Too eager. Too intense.\n\nThe Overgeared members stared at him with unblinking focus. Their eyes screamed *be our friend* in silent unison.\n\nKraugel cleared his throat.\n\n\"My mother suddenly called, so I should go.\" His hand moved to his menu. \"Log out.\"\n\nHis avatar dissolved.\n\nSilence.\n\nGrid stood frozen. The Overgeared members exchanged bewildered glances.\n\nThe peak of two billion users. The sky above the sky. The absolute leader who monopolized the rankings.\n\nHad just used his mother as an excuse to log out.\n\nLike an elementary school student caught in an awkward social situation.\n\nGrid didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the absurdity."
