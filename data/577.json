  "content": "# Reinhardt Palace's Garden\n\nA black sphere hovered in the garden—an ominous orb that pulsed with raw demonic energy. Anyone who looked upon it felt an inexorable pull, as though body and soul alike were being drawn into its depths. This was the 32nd Hell, summoned by Belial herself. From the outside, it appeared barely large enough to contain three people, yet within its boundaries stretched an entire universe.\n\n\"Hrmm...\"\n\nHao circled the sphere, searching for any sign of weakness, when his gaze suddenly shifted toward the inner palace.\n\n*Could the summoner be the key?*\n\nKing Aslan had sacrificed 9,999 virgins to call forth the Great Demon. If Hao could reach the king, he might discover Belial's vulnerability.\n\n*I need to hurry.*\n\nFour hours had passed since Kraugel entered the 32nd Hell. Anxiety gnawed at Hao—he'd done nothing to help. He quickened his pace, determination rising. If he could just—\n\n*Crack!*\n\nFissures spiderwebbed across the sphere's surface.\n\n*CRACK-CRACK-CRACK!*\n\nA deafening explosion erupted from within the black orb.\n\n*BOOM!*\n\nThe sphere shattered into countless fragments.\n\n\"It can't be...!\"\n\n*The Sky Above the Sky succeeded!* Hao's heart thundered in his chest, joy flooding through him.\n\n*Thud!*\n\n*Thud-thud-thud-thud-thud!*\n\nHundreds of bodies poured from the destroyed sphere. Sword Saint Kraugel and the Overgeared members tumbled out, every one of them grievously wounded, clothes soaked crimson with blood.\n\n\"Kraugel!\"\n\nHao sprinted forward. Kraugel looked as battered as he had after his duel with Grid at the National Competition—nothing like a victor.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Hao fumbled with his inventory, pressing potions into Kraugel's hands. Then he froze, goosebumps rippling across his skin.\n\nBeyond Kraugel, amid the collapsed remnants of the 32nd Hell, the Great Demon knelt in agony. And standing above her, looking down at the absolute monarch of Hell—\n\nGrid.\n\nHao's breath caught in his throat. The sight of Grid dominating the demon sent ice through his veins.\n\n*That's Grid...*\n\nA thought surfaced unbidden: *What if I had met Grid first instead of Kraugel?*\n\n*I would have admired him.*\n\nOf course, for Hao now, Kraugel remained supreme.\n\n***\n\n> **[Watched by the Gods]**\n>\n> The Red Phoenix Bow you produced is outstanding enough to be compared to the battle gear of the god realm.\n>\n> The gods see you as a legend who will go beyond history and eventually become a myth.\n\nThat was the description of Grid's newest title—the reward for crafting the Red Phoenix Bow. No special abilities. No stat bonuses. Just... the gods watching.\n\nGrid had been bitterly disappointed. He was the *first player* to produce a myth-rated item, and this was his reward? Divine surveillance?\n\nHe'd thought it absurd, convinced the Satisfy developers simply hadn't anticipated anyone reaching this milestone. But now, in this moment, Grid understood the true value of divine attention.\n\n> **[The new fusion skill Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle has been learned!]**\n>\n> **[Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle]**\n>\n> Four types of sword techniques are connected.\n>\n> 1,500% of your attack power will be dealt to the target due to Linked Kill.\n>\n> If the target is hit at least four times, the damage of Linked Kill will increase by 200% and Wave will be summoned.\n>\n> Wave will affect any enemy within a range of 5 meters. It will deal 500% of your attack power and all targets hit will have all speeds decreased by 30%. In addition, there will be definite damage from the Pinnacle that follows.\n>\n> Pinnacle ignores 80% of the target's defense and deals 1,800% of your attack power as physical damage.\n>\n> * This skill doesn't share a cooldown with Link, Kill, Wave, and Pinnacle.\n>\n> **Skill Mana Consumption:** Half of the maximum mana.\n>\n> **Skill Cooldown Time:** 3 hours.\n\n\"...!\"\n\nA new ultimate technique! The power of Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle—born through Goddess Rebecca's blessing—far surpassed even Linked Kill Wave. The full effect required four consecutive hits, but Linked Kill would be worthless if an enemy could dodge that many strikes.\n\n*I can land this!*\n\nGrid trusted his control. He'd fought countless powerful opponents. He'd *grown*.\n\n*Thunk.*\n\n*THUNK!*\n\n*BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!*\n\n> **[Critical!]**\n>\n> **[The effect of the title 'Death in One Shot!' has been activated, adding 30% critical damage!]**\n>\n> **[The weak spot has been attacked! Further damage will be dealt!!]**\n>\n> **[You have dealt 25,008,519 damage to the target.]**\n>\n> **[The hidden passive 'God's Command' has reset the cooldown of Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle.]**\n>\n> **[Critical!]**\n>\n> **[The effect of the title 'Death in One Shot!' has been...]**\n>\n> **[The weakness has been...]**\n>\n> **[You have dealt 2,691,399 damage to the target.]**\n\n\"K-KIEEEEEEK!\"\n\nThe Sword Saint Aura doubled his sword skills' power. Combined with Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle, the damage transcended two consecutive Linked Kills. Even with her overwhelming level reducing Grid's effective attack power, Belial couldn't suppress her scream. The pain rivaled Piaro's Fated to Perish.\n\nGrid watched Belial's health gauge plummet below 4%, excitement surging through him.\n\n*This is broken!*\n\nDespite Belial's massive defense and level advantage drastically reducing his damage output, he'd still dealt over 25 million in a single combo. The Sword Saint Aura was powerful, certainly, but at this level, he could one-shot the drake he'd faced during the National Competition.\n\nGrid trembled with exhilaration—then Belial lashed out wildly. A Great Demon's tenacity knew no bounds. Her soul burned, fury incarnate. She stood on the threshold of true death, and she would drag every enemy before her into oblivion, even if she perished in the process.\n\n\"Damn human!\"\n\n*ROAR!*\n\nBelial's hand shot toward Grid. Flames spiraled like a drill, sharp enough to pierce a dragon's heart, containing enough explosive force to level a city.\n\n*Too fast—!*\n\nBelial's physical capabilities exceeded even Piaro's. Her technique was crude, but her sheer speed was overwhelming. Grid couldn't track it. Even the God Hands were too slow. Grid braced himself, staring death in the face—\n\n\"Nayooong!\"\n\nNoe, who'd been passively hovering since his summons, lunged forward. His claws flashed toward Belial. For thousands of years, Memphis had served as pets to the Great Demons. The genetic imperative to obey them ran deep in Noe's blood—yet he overcame that primal instinct. He *had* to protect Grid, who'd been with him since the moment he hatched!\n\n*STAB!*\n\n\"...!\"\n\nNoe accelerated past the God Hands, interposing himself between Grid and Belial. Her flaming magic pierced straight through him.\n\n\"This Memphis...!\" Belial stared in disbelief at Noe's crossed-out eyes and lolling red tongue. Her opportunity to kill Grid had slipped away, and rage consumed her. The Great Demon's twisted expression was enough to instill fear in everyone watching.\n\nBut the world wasn't panicked by Belial's face.\n\nWhat terrified them was Grid's expression.\n\n—That look...\n\nGrid's eyes blazed with feral rage. His killing intent reminded viewers of his past.\n\nThe Cruel Butcher.\n\nThe Psychopath.\n\nThere was a madness in Grid that ordinary people couldn't comprehend.\n\n\"You hurt my Noe...!\"\n\nNormally, Grid sacrificed his pets without much thought. After all, pets were like players—they resurrected no matter how many times they died. But it should happen with Randy and Noe's *agreement*. He never wanted his precious companions killed by enemies without his consent.\n\n\"I'LL KILL YOU!\"\n\n*SLASH!*\n\n*SLASH-SLASH-SLASH-SLASH!*\n\nThe combined Failure + Grid's Greatsword—with less than twenty seconds remaining—carved toward Belial. The God Hands wielding Mjolnir responded to Grid's fury, hammers swinging at the demon. But landing a clean hit proved nearly impossible. Multiple layers of fire shields and demonic energy formed an impenetrable defense.\n\nThe Great Demon had been severely weakened by the 32nd Hell's destruction. Yet the overwhelming level gap remained, and she gradually gained the upper hand.\n\n\"Human! This is the difference between us! Legend? Ridiculous! No matter how hard a human struggles, you cannot escape your natural limits!\"\n\n*BOOM!*\n\nBelial stomped the ground. Flames erupted upward, engulfing Grid.\n\n\"Kuk...!\"\n\nGrid tried to defend against the unexpected ground-based magic, but he was already too late. Fire seared his face.\n\n*CRASH!*\n\n\"Cough!\"\n\n\"Grid!\" Yura's face went pale.\n\n\"Youngwoo!\" Jishuka cried out.\n\nGrid's health bar dropped precipitously from that single strike. One or two more hits would trigger his Immortal State.\n\n\"This is the end!\"\n\nBelial pressed her advantage, lunging for Grid. But she couldn't reach him.\n\n*CLANG!*\n\nIyarugt's blade intercepted her path.\n\n\"How long will you ignore me?\"\n\nBelial sneered at the demon sword. \"Your current strength is so pathetic you don't even register as a threat.\"\n\nBelial had initially recoiled when Iyarugt first appeared, but the sword was drastically weakened now. There was no reason to fear him.\n\n\"You dare!\" \n\nIn the old days, this Great Demon would never have dismissed him so casually! Iyarugt attacked Belial with every ounce of stamina and strength he possessed. It was useless.\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nBelial swatted Iyarugt aside effortlessly and closed in on Grid.\n\n\"Die!\"\n\nBelial's voice rang with triumphant malice. She watched flames streak toward Grid's chest, victory mere moments away.\n\n\"Behind you.\"\n\nAt that instant—\n\n\"Fated to Perish.\"\n\n*THOOM!*\n\nA hand plow descended from the heavens, striking Belial's head. Piaro had returned. After the 32nd Hell collapsed, Ruby and Damian had been able to use mana potions and concentrate all their healing on him.\n\n\"Kuock!\"\n\nThe hand plow's impact stunned Belial. Her vision blurred, then focused on the massive mortar plummeting from the sky. A catastrophe even a Great Demon couldn't avert.\n\n*BOOOOOM!*\n\n> **[The raid of the 32nd Great Demon Belial has succeeded!]**\n>\n> **[The soul of the 32nd Great Demon Belial has been destroyed and won't be able to reincarnate!]**\n>\n> **[The position of 32nd monarch has temporarily become vacant.]**\n>\n> **[All players who participated in the Belial raid will receive the title 'Savior of the World.']**\n>\n> **[All players who participated in the Belial raid will receive different compensation based on their performance!]**\n>\n> **[Piaro has obtained the raid's 1st prize.]**\n>\n> **[Yura has obtained the raid's 2nd prize.]**\n>\n> **[Kraugel has obtained the raid's 3rd prize.]**\n>\n> **[Ibellin has obtained the raid's 4th prize.]**\n>\n> **[Grid has obtained the raid's 5th prize.]**\n>\n> **[Isabel has obtained the raid's 6th prize.]**\n>\n> **[Damian has obtained the raid's 7th prize.]**\n>\n> **[Jishuka has obtained the raid's 8th prize.]**\n>\n> **[★ Saintess Ruby has obtained extraordinary rewards in exchange for annihilating the soul of the great demon!★]**\n>\n> **[Other personnel will be given equal compensation.]**\n\n\"Wow, amazing.\"\n\nThe Grid siblings had joined the raid at the very end and still claimed fifth place and a special prize? The Overgeared members stared in astonishment. Once again, they were reminded of how exceptional Grid truly was.\n\nBut Grid himself wasn't satisfied.\n\n*Fifth place... Well, it's not bad.*\n\nThe superior rewards had gone to his companions. No reason to feel regret.\n\nPiaro approached, arms laden with Belial's staff, horns, bones, and mysterious jewels. He bowed deeply to Grid.\n\n\"I will give the loot I obtained from exterminating the Great Demon to my lord.\"\n\nA perfectly trained NPC worthy of envy! The smiles shared between Grid and Piaro that day would forever change the world's perception of NPCs."
