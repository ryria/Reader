Grid May Face Severe Penalties for Dual Worship**\n\nThe world erupted into chaos as Grid disappeared during the live broadcast. His sudden, unexplained vanishing spawned countless theories across every forum and news outlet.\n\n\"King Grid is safe,\" the Overgeared Kingdom's official statement read. \"He has simply logged out.\"\n\n*Logged out?* During the most important ceremony in the kingdom's history? The explanation satisfied no one. If anything, it fueled wilder speculation. Soon, rumors spread that Grid had been cursed by a great demon—perhaps even dragged bodily into Hell itself.\n\nThen the testimonies began.\n\n\"The senior priests have confirmed it,\" claimed several Rebecca Church players. \"The Goddess herself struck Grid down for the sin of serving another god.\"\n\nTwelve hours passed with no sign of Grid. The most powerful player in Satisfy—vanished without a trace. Commentators declared it the beginning of his downfall.\n\nThe headlines wrote themselves.\n\n***\n\n*This is...*\n\nGrid stared at the quest notification, his jaw tight. The penalties for failure were catastrophic.\n\nYet the timing felt *too* convenient. He'd just received Picasso's masterpiece—the painting that could restore his strength in a moment of crisis. And now, immediately after, a duel with a god.\n\n*Too perfect. Like someone arranged the pieces specifically for this moment.*\n\nIf he lost, the Protagonist of the Extremely Honorable Painting could save him. It was as if the skill whispered in his ear: *Don't worry. I'll catch you if you fall.*\n\nGrid's eyes narrowed. *Wait...*\n\nPicasso was a player. Just a player. She couldn't have known what he'd face today, couldn't have painted a roadmap for his future.\n\nUnless...\n\nIn Satisfy, the world responded to player choices. History bent around their actions. One painting, drawn by one player, could alter the course of events.\n\n*Did the painting itself create this situation?*\n\nMaybe Hexetia's jealousy stemmed partly from seeing Grid immortalized in that masterwork. Maybe that painting was always meant to lead to this confrontation—making now the perfect time to use its power.\n\n*I could lose and walk away with minimal damage.*\n\nSo what if he lost?\n\n*No.*\n\nGrid's hands curled into fists.\n\n*I'm going to win.*\n\nThe quest rewards proved this was a battle worth winning. More than that—it was what Grid wanted. He needed to overcome Hexetia's resentment, break the curse on the First Holy Sword, and claim the goddess' blessing twice over. To enhance both Pagma's Swordsmanship *and* his blacksmithing simultaneously.\n\nThat was the goal.\n\nBefore him stood a god wearing human skin. Hexetia lived in a shabby cabin that couldn't compare to the great demons' towering fortresses—yet he existed on an entirely different level. The heat radiating from his body, the flames flickering on his...\n\nGrid swallowed hard.\n\n*Focus.*\n\nThis enemy was more terrifying than any he'd faced. Sweat traced down his temple despite his title as Overgeared King.\n\n\"You humans may have forgotten,\" Hexetia began, his voice resonating with divine weight, \"but when I received the goddess' will, I forged a million tools and scattered them across the earth. From simple tableware and farming implements to precious jewelry and legendary weapons—all flowed from my hands.\"\n\nGrid remained silent, recognizing this was more than boasting. Hexetia was explaining the rules. He focused, unwilling to miss a single word.\n\n\"Yes. Humanity reproduced my creations.\" Anger flickered across Hexetia's features. Real, burning anger. \"Yet you grew deluded. You believed it was your own talent, your own genius. You elevated mere imitators to the status of 'new gods'... *like you.*\"\n\nThe temperature in the cabin spiked.\n\n\"I feel *sick* watching humans praised for copying my work!\" Hexetia's voice cracked like breaking stone. \"Disgusted by fools who've forgotten their true benefactor! Therefore—! *Therefore—!*\"\n\nHe'd wanted to destroy humanity. To end the cycle of ingratitude before it repeated again. But this blacksmith—this one who claimed to be \"beyond a god\"—had proven different. He'd proclaimed Hexetia's achievements to the world. Claimed to respect him.\n\nTo be honest? Hexetia had felt... happy. A throbbing sensation in his chest—an emotion entirely foreign to his endless existence. He was grateful to Grid.\n\nBut gratitude and trust were different things.\n\nFor the first time in tens of thousands of years, a human had appeared who seemed genuinely different. Of course Hexetia had doubts.\n\n*I need to be certain.*\n\nThis was his home. His domain. Hexetia wanted to acknowledge Grid's abilities—to know this human could stand firm on his own strength. Only then could he truly trust him.\n\nTherefore—\n\n\"Prove yourself!\" Hexetia demanded. \"Prove you're not just another pretender riding on borrowed glory! If you can demonstrate true skill, I will acknowledge and trust you!\"\n\nThe duel wasn't about pursuit or worship anymore. It was about validation.\n\nGrid's response came without hesitation.\n\n\"Alright.\" His eyes met Hexetia's divine gaze without flinching. \"I'll prove it.\"\n\nThis transcended the quest rewards now. Grid refused to let his accumulated effort and experience become meaningless. He needed Hexetia to recognize his strength for what it truly was.\n\n\"Good answer!\" Hexetia's expression softened slightly. \"I'll grant you mercy! You choose the theme of our contest!\"\n\nA sword? Armor? A spear?\n\n*No*, Hexetia thought. *He won't be foolish enough to choose battle gear—my greatest specialty. He'll pick something that gives him better odds.*\n\nHexetia hoped for exactly that. He wanted Grid to have a fighting chance.\n\n\"A sword.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\n\"Let's see who can forge the more powerful sword.\"\n\n\"You—!\"\n\nHexetia's face twisted. Was Grid *mocking* him? All that outward respect—was it nothing but empty flattery after all? His divine form trembled with fury.\n\n\"My confidence doesn't come from disrespect,\" Grid said quietly. \"Only from the experience and effort I've spent years accumulating.\"\n\n\"*Hah!* Talking about experience when you've only been a blacksmith for ten years?\"\n\n\"Ten years *is* a long time for me.\" Grid's voice remained steady. \"I spent every single day of it struggling to improve.\"\n\nHe wasn't exaggerating. Since becoming Pagma's Descendant, Grid had worked relentlessly—starting from the absolute bottom and clawing his way to the summit through sheer stubbornness.\n\n\"This won't be easy for either of us.\"\n\nGrid's eyes carried a depth that made even Hexetia pause. He produced his portable furnace, loaded it with white phosphorus wood, and began building the fire.\n\nHexetia scoffed. \"You take *so* long to make a simple fire. Watch. This is the power of a god.\"\n\nHe exposed his chest and raised both hands.\n\n*Divine power?*\n\nGrid's throat went dry. He couldn't even imagine what a god's power truly looked like.\n\nThen—\n\n\"*Haap!*\"\n\nWith intense concentration, Hexetia twisted both nipples between his thumbs and forefingers.\n\nBlue flame erupted from his left nipple. Red flame burst from his right. Both streams struck Grid's furnace, and the white phosphorus wood—the finest timber on the entire East Continent—ignited instantly. The temperature shot past Grid's target level in seconds.\n\n*This is the power of the blacksmith god.*\n\nUndeniably impressive.\n\n*...Those fucking nipples.*\n\nGrid violently suppressed the thought. Making fun of Hexetia's method would only wound the god's already fragile self-esteem.\n\nShaking his head, Grid offered sincere thanks. Then he called out: \"God Hands.\"\n\nNot for extra assistance against a god. The reason was far more specific—and painful.\n\nPavranium.\n\nThe legendary mineral created through collaboration between Pagma and Braham. To obtain it, Grid gave the order. The four golden hands dove into the furnace without hesitation and began to melt. Years of accumulated experience in those growth-type items—gone in an instant.\n\n*Fighting a god requires sacrifice.*\n\nGrid steadied his aching heart. He had faith. With his current skill level, he could recreate God Hands that would surpass their previous forms.\n\n*I'll resurrect you properly. But first...*\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nGrid smelted, tempered, and quenched the pavranium on his anvil. The hammer came first. Once he produced a blacksmithing hammer from the ultimate mineral—born from the combined knowledge of Pagma and Braham—*then* he would forge the sword itself.\n\n\"We're not working on a time limit, right?\" Grid flashed Hexetia a confident grin and summoned the light elemental. It transformed into a Sword of Light, which he set to training the mithril automatically.\n\nTechnique. Knowledge. Materials. Tools.\n\nGrid poured *everything* into this match.\n\nPerhaps for the first time ever, he would craft true battle gear from pavranium.\n\n*CLANG!*\n\nEach hammer strike sent brilliant white light cascading across the golden clouds. The entire field blazed with radiance—a spectacle magnificent enough to soothe even Hexetia's volatile temper.\n\nThe god watched, and gradually, understanding dawned.\n\n*Truly... he truly does respect me.*\n\nHexetia's harsh gaze softened. He picked up his own hammer—forged from divine stone—and felt something entirely new.\n\n*Joy.*\n\nFor the first time in his eternal existence, Hexetia felt joy."
