  "content": "The organizers granted the Demon King subjugation participants a twenty-minute strategy session—time that counted against neither the Four Heavenly Kings' skill cooldowns nor Grid's accumulated health buffs and crafting progress. Everything was frozen in place.\n\n\"Consolidate our strongest forces into a single strike team.\" China's Zhang Jian spoke with cold practicality. \"We divided our top players across four groups chasing additional medals. That was a mistake. Pool our strength—one team breaches the gates while the other three focus solely on the Demon King himself.\"\n\n\"You're suggesting we sacrifice three-quarters of our force?\"\n\n\"The most efficient path to victory.\" Zhang Jian's tone carried no apology. \"One elite team breaks through. The rest earn their medals facing the final boss.\"\n\nThe broadcast carried his words to a global audience. Ratings continued climbing as millions watched the deliberation unfold. Zhang Jian seemed unbothered by the inevitable international backlash.\n\nBut his proposal had a fatal flaw.\n\n\"If we're forming an elite team,\" Argentina's Seuron said flatly, \"China shouldn't be on it. You guys died in the opening seconds of the last attempt. Why should we carry dead weight?\"\n\nZhang Jian's face flushed crimson. \"That was because—\"\n\n\"The existing teams stay together.\" Peak Sword's interruption was decisive. \"We maintain our current formations.\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhang Jian sputtered, but he already sensed the shift in the room. \n\nPeak Sword had professional experience handling exactly this type of situation—arrogant players who'd lost the crowd's favor. He turned away from Zhang Jian entirely, addressing the assembled rankers instead. \"What do the rest of you think?\"\n\nThe room's power dynamics crystallized instantly. Zhang Jian's mouth snapped shut the moment Peak Sword deferred to players like Kraugel, Chris, and Zibal. He retreated without another word, recognizing the hierarchy.\n\nChris nodded. \"Second attempts are always easier. We've seen their patterns.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Zibal added. \"We have the data now.\"\n\nEvery player present possessed ranker-tier stats and instincts. Armed with combat intelligence from the first clash, they'd fight twice as effectively. Kraugel's opinion carried the most weight—with Grid absent, the Sky King's word was law.\n\n\"Proceed as planned,\" Kraugel said.\n\nThat settled it. Four hundred players regrouped at their original gates, ready to test their analysis against the Four Heavenly Kings.\n\n---\n\nAt the west gate, Peak Sword addressed Group B with military efficiency.\n\n\"You all saw what she can do. Her stats dropped thirty percent, but certain skills will still one-shot any of us.\" He swept his gaze across the assembled players. \"Treat her like you'd treat God Grid himself—don't get hit by the big attacks.\"\n\nMurmurs of acknowledgment rippled through the group.\n\n\"We lasted thirty minutes last time. You've seen most of her patterns. You *can* win this.\" Peak Sword's attention shifted. \"Magician Goshar.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Fight ugly.\"\n\nThe gathered magicians understood immediately. This was Overgeared Guild doctrine, preached by their top casters Zednos and Laella: *magicians must abandon pride in combat*. That meant constant movement during spellcasting—trusting mana shields and sacrificing optimal positioning for survival.\n\nGoshar grimaced. \"You want me running around like a grunt?\"\n\nThe magician class appealed to players who valued *aesthetics*. Standing immobile while raining devastation on distant enemies—that was the fantasy. Sweating and scrambling destroyed the image, especially with billions watching worldwide.\n\nBut reality superseded ego.\n\n\"No choice if we want that medal,\" someone muttered.\n\n\"Can't argue with the boss's strength,\" another agreed.\n\nGoshar made his decision. This opponent was the strongest he'd ever faced—clinging to pride would only guarantee defeat. His initial misjudgment during the first attempt had been inexcusable; he wouldn't repeat that mistake.\n\nHe extended his hand. \"I'll do whatever it takes.\"\n\nPeak Sword clasped it firmly. \"Then let's win.\"\n\nThe second challenge was critical. If they failed again, the third attempt would eliminate bronze medal compensation entirely—morale would collapse, and with it, their offensive capability. Properly motivated now, the players surged toward their gates.\n\n---\n\nAt the north gate, Jishuka's eyes blazed with predatory focus.\n\n\"This time I won't fall for your cute act,\" she growled. The ferocity enhanced rather than diminished her beauty—she resembled a poisonous flower, alluring and lethal in equal measure. Though only one man would ever willingly taste that poison.\n\n\"Damian. Bless my arrows.\"\n\nThe vampire earl Noll shared a crucial trait with Euphemina: conditional power scaling. With adequate blood supply and allied support, Noll could surpass even Piaro or Mercedes. But he stood alone now. His survivability remained exceptional, yet his offensive capability was the weakest among the Four Heavenly Kings.\n\nGroup D should have secured victory in the first attempt. They possessed the most raid-optimized composition of the four teams. But Jishuka had played support, and Damian had focused on wide-area healing instead of concentrated buffs. They'd fought *passively*, reacting to Noll's area-of-effect magic rather than pressing their advantage.\n\nA common enough mistake. First attempts always proved hardest—success rates plummeted against unknown boss mechanics and attack patterns.\n\nGroups A, B, and C had faced similar struggles. Group A identified Piaro's mudflat advantage too late. Group B mistook Mercedes for a berserker-type fighter. Group C suffered devastating casualties to Asmophel's opening assault.\n\n\"Understood.\" Damian abandoned his middle-row position, moving to the rear line instead. \"I'll refresh your buffs with every shot.\"\n\nHe concentrated his divine power on the primary damage dealers: Jishuka, Katz, and Haster. Jishuka received layered buffs on both her bow and arrows—the latter qualifying as auxiliary weapons under Satisfy's classification system.\n\nShe nocked five arrows simultaneously, drawing a bead on the masked figure ahead.\n\n\"Sorry, Noll. I can't afford to go easy on you.\"\n\nThe arrows vanished into the darkness, utterly silent.\n\nNo player alive could track their flight path—not even Kraugel's Super Sensitivity, which relied on sight and sound cues that simply didn't exist. Jishuka's shots transcended such limitations.\n\n*Thunk-thunk-thunk-thunk-thunk.*\n\nForehead. Left foot. Right foot. Shoulder. Chest. Five impacts within a fraction of a second. Noll's head snapped back, blood misting the air like crimson rain.\n\n\"Let's begin.\" Jishuka's sultry tone electrified Group D's morale.\n\n---\n\nThe second clash unfolded with dramatic efficiency. Four hundred players attacked with surgical precision, threatening the Four Heavenly Kings while dodging their counterstrikes with vastly improved accuracy. Each group immediately recognized the tells for area-of-effect skills.\n\n\"Incredible,\" spectators breathed. \"They're actually doing it.\"\n\n\"These rankers are on another level.\"\n\nThe audience watched in awe as analytical skills and teamwork transformed the battlefield. The Four Heavenly Kings weren't simply losing because of reduced stats—the players were *exploiting* their mechanics now.\n\nGroup C disrupted Vin's blinding swordwork through coordinated interference.\n\nKobold's seemingly endless regeneration faltered under Jishuka's relentless bombardment.\n\nBenz exhausted herself chasing mobile spellcasters who refused to stand still.\n\nCardin's mudflat advantage evaporated as Group A controlled the terrain.\n\nWhen the Four Heavenly Kings attempted their ultimate techniques, the players already knew the timing windows. Defense-piercing skills carved through their health bars methodically. The numerical advantage was simply insurmountable—even with a ten-percent hit rate across one hundred attackers, that guaranteed ten successful strikes. Limited health pools couldn't absorb infinite damage.\n\nThe group leaders proved especially devastating. Kraugel, Chris, Zibal, Peak Sword, Jishuka, Haster—each brought genuine threat-level power to bear. The Four Heavenly Kings couldn't maintain their defenses forever.\n\nFinally...\n\n> **[Kobold of the North Gate has fallen.]**\n>\n> **[Group D has breached the North Gate!]**\n>\n> **[Top Contributor: Brazil's Jishuka]**\n>\n> **[Second Place: Japan's Damian]**\n>\n> **[Third Place: Japan's Katz]**\n\nThirty-seven minutes after engagement, the first gate collapsed.\n\nThe stadium *erupted*. Spectators and viewers worldwide roared their approval, witnessing ranker-tier skill in real time. The Demon King's defeat seemed inevitable now—surely even his power couldn't stand against four hundred elite players united.\n\n\"*JISHUKA!*\"\n\n\"KRAUGEL! KRAUGEL! KRAUGEL!\"\n\n\"PEAK SWORD IS A GOD!\"\n\n\"I NEED A MAGIC MACHINE!\"\n\nNational boundaries dissolved. For the first time in National Competition history, the global audience unified behind a single cause. The Demon King had become humanity's common enemy, and humanity was winning."
