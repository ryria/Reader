  "content": "# Chapter: The Saint's Return\n\n**『 Two billion Satisfy players across the world—the 3rd National Competition you've all been waiting for begins NOW! 』**\n\nThe roar of the crowd shook the stadium.\n\nThis year's opening event was the Saint Sword Drawing, a competition historically overshadowed by flashier contests. Most years, it barely warranted attention—a niche challenge that demanded equal parts strength, intelligence, and finesse. Too cerebral for casual viewers. Too technical to generate hype.\n\nBut this year was different.\n\nTwo names had changed everything: **Sword Saint Kraugel** and **Demon Slayer Yura**.\n\nThe chat exploded.\n\n*—We get to see Kraugel on opening day! I'm losing my mind!*\n\n*—God Kraugel as the opening act... He's basically the main character lol*\n\n*—Wait, isn't this just whoever pulls the sword first? Kraugel's a Sword Saint—won't the blade choose him automatically?*\n\n*—Nah, can't be that simple. They wouldn't make it a competition otherwise.*\n\nThe premise was straightforward: inspired by Arthurian legend, the first participant to draw the holy blade from its stone would claim victory. But the path to that moment was anything but simple. Players had to navigate a gauntlet of trials testing combat prowess, problem-solving, and adaptability.\n\nIt was a grueling test of both mind and body—precisely why it struggled to draw crowds. In last year's competition, the event had been relegated to nameless rankers, a footnote in the larger spectacle.\n\nNot this time.\n\n\"God, I'm so pumped to watch this!\"\n\n\"Makes sense for Kraugel—he's a Sword Saint. Perfect fit. But Yura? Why's she here? Couldn't she compete in something else?\"\n\n\"Probably playing it safe. Low competition means easier medal. South Korea needs every point they can get if they want to avoid dead last.\"\n\n\"She got screwed when they removed Hell Running for 'balance reasons.' That was her specialty.\"\n\n\"Still... picking this event means she's stuck facing Kraugel. Talk about bad luck. I almost feel sorry for her.\"\n\nTo most observers, Yura was a known quantity—a top-tier player whose reputation had been forged in the **Great Demon Belial raid**. But popular opinion dismissed her strength as situational. *Good against demons, mediocre elsewhere.*\n\nThat assessment was accurate.\n\n**Until a few months ago.**\n\n---\n\n## **Bruton Island**\n\nThe battlefield for the Saint Sword Drawing was divided into three distinct zones:\n\n**The Safety Zone** — A circular area at the island's heart where PvP was disabled. The sword in the stone rested here, gleaming beneath the sun.\n\n**The Route Zone** — A network of pathways connecting nine villages scattered across the island. PvP was technically allowed, but attacking another player flagged you as a criminal, making you fair game for NPC guardians. Hidden shrines offered resource recovery, though their locations weren't marked on any map. Each village sat roughly three kilometers apart.\n\n**The Chaotic Zone** — Everything else. No rules. No mercy. Players had to remain vigilant at all times—the wilderness was crawling with monsters, including several named bosses capable of wiping unprepared parties.\n\n---\n\n**｛ A sword is not important. ｝**\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nForty-two participants stood in the Safety Zone, staring at the inscription carved into the marble base beneath the holy blade.\n\n*A sword isn't important?* What kind of riddle was that? The entire event revolved around pulling a sword from stone. Why would the inscription *deny* its own significance?\n\nMost of the competitors froze, minds racing.\n\nBut not all of them.\n\nKraugel's eyes narrowed. *'A sword that doesn't want someone who relies on it...'*\n\nYura's lips curved faintly. *'It's searching for inherent strength. Not power borrowed, but power owned.'*\n\nThey understood simultaneously.\n\nThe answer wasn't philosophy—it was **action**.\n\n---\n\n*Whoosh.*\n\nBoth moved at once.\n\nTo prove inherent strength? Simple. **Combat.**\n\nKraugel and Yura bolted from the Safety Zone toward the Chaotic Zone, their paths converging as they entered the treeline.\n\n*Shring.*\n\nKraugel spotted Yura vanishing into the shadowed forest ahead. His hand moved to his weapon—**White Fang**, a gleaming silver blade forged from dragon bone.\n\n*'She's dangerous.'*\n\nYura had been ranked among the world's top ten for years. Kraugel respected her skill enough to know one truth: *if he didn't eliminate her now, she'd become a problem later.*\n\n*Dash!*\n\nJust before Yura disappeared into the dense foliage, Kraugel activated **White Light Steps**. His form blurred, refracted sunlight bending around him as he entered stealth.\n\n\"Ah! Yura!!\"\n\nThe crowd gasped.\n\n\"She's done for!\"\n\n\"Kraugel's ruthless—no mercy, no hesitation!\"\n\n\"That's why we love him! Go Kraugel!\"\n\nThe commentators leaned forward. The Korean representatives watching from the waiting room exchanged grim looks.\n\n\"Almost no one can handle Kraugel's opening pressure,\" someone muttered. \"If she let him close the gap, it's over.\"\n\nPeak Sword bit his nails, silently praying. *'Please, Yura... see him coming. Get your gun out. Block him before he reaches you.'*\n\nHe couldn't imagine any other way she'd survive.\n\nBut **Grid** was different.\n\nSitting calmly in the stands, he watched the screen with quiet confidence.\n\n*'Show me.'*\n\nHe believed in her. In the pride she'd carried with her into hell. In the months she'd spent clawing her way back.\n\n*'You've got this.'*\n\nYura had vanished into hell for months, enduring horrors most players would never face. She *had* to have grown. Now was the time to prove it—not to the world, but to herself.\n\nIf she failed here, no one would be more devastated than her.\n\nGrid clenched his fist. *'I believe in you.'*\n\n---\n\nPerhaps it was coincidence.\n\nPerhaps it was faith.\n\nEither way, Yura remembered her promise to Grid.\n\n*Slash—*\n\nThe fight unfolded in a way **no one** expected.\n\nThe instant Kraugel closed in, blade poised to strike—\n\n\"**Hell Leap.**\"\n\nYura didn't flinch. Didn't panic. She spoke the skill name calmly, as if she'd known he was there all along.\n\nCrimson light enveloped her body.\n\nAnd then she was **gone**.\n\n---\n\n*'Stealth?'*\n\nKraugel's mind raced. Disappearing like that wasn't normal invisibility—it felt like teleportation. But teleportation magic belonged exclusively to mages, and Yura wasn't a mage.\n\nWhich meant it had to be a trick.\n\nHe didn't hesitate. His sword continued its arc, slicing through the space where Yura had stood. He expected blood. Expected her to reappear, exposed and vulnerable.\n\nBut—\n\n*Whooom.*\n\n\"...?!\"\n\nNothing. His blade cut only air.\n\nNo impact. No resistance. Just the faint afterglow of **White Fang** shimmering in the sunlight.\n\nKraugel's eyes widened.\n\nThen—\n\n*Shhhhk.*\n\nA **black hole** materialized behind him.\n\nNo warning. No sound. No distortion in the air that his **Super Sensitivity** could detect.\n\nAnd out of that void stepped **Yura**.\n\n---\n\n\"?!\"\n\nThe faint rustle of fabric brushed against his ear.\n\nKraugel spun reflexively, **White Fang** arcing backward in a desperate counter.\n\n*Thunk!*\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nKraugel wasn't a god. He didn't have eyes in the back of his head. His reactionary swing missed entirely—and worse, his **Super Sensitivity** had failed to detect her approach until the last possible instant.\n\nYura's blade pierced cleanly into his back.\n\n\"...!!!\"\n\n\"!!!!\"\n\n**『 What—?! 』**\n\nThe players. The crowd. The commentators. Even the viewers watching from home—everyone's jaws dropped.\n\nBut no one was more shocked than **Kraugel** himself.\n\n*I got hit.*\n\nThis wasn't like the skirmishes on Battlefield, where stats were equalized and randomness ruled.\n\nThis was **Satisfy**.\n\nHere, Kraugel was absolute. Untouchable. The **Sky Above the Sky**—a title earned through dominance so complete that most players didn't even try to challenge him anymore.\n\nAnd yet, in a direct confrontation, someone had just landed a clean hit.\n\nFor the first time in his career, Kraugel had been **outplayed**.\n\n---\n\n*Swish!*\n\nWhile Kraugel processed the shock, Yura withdrew her blade and pivoted gracefully, her movements fluid and controlled—like a swan gliding across water.\n\n*Slash!*\n\nThe sword spun with centrifugal force, driving toward Kraugel's exposed flank.\n\nMonths in hell had honed her swordsmanship into something razor-sharp and unrelenting.\n\n*Clang!*\n\nKraugel barely managed to parry.\n\nNow that they were face-to-face, his **Super Sensitivity** kicked in fully. He could read her movements again. He deflected the strike with **White Fang**, then activated his newly acquired **Weapon Swallowing**—a Sword Saint's unique ability.\n\n*Click.*\n\nHis blade interlocked with hers, twisting her posture off-balance. Yura's upper body lurched forward, her face suddenly inches from his.\n\nClose enough that their breath mingled. Close enough that a kiss wouldn't have been out of the question.\n\n\"Ohhhhhh!\"\n\n\"It's like Grid's romance scene—but with Kraugel instead!\"\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers.\n\nBut the two combatants remained ice-cold, their expressions unreadable as they whispered.\n\n\"I didn't think I'd ever taste defeat from anyone other than Grid.\"\n\n\"Don't lump him in with everyone else.\" Yura's voice was quiet but firm. \"Youngwoo is the only one who's special to me.\"\n\n\"Hah...?\"\n\n*Bang!*\n\nBefore Kraugel could process her words, Yura's free hand—her **left** hand—whipped up.\n\nShe held a gun.\n\nAnd pulled the trigger.\n\n---\n\nThe bullet was faster than Kraugel's sword.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nAt point-blank range, there was no dodging.\n\nBlood sprayed from Kraugel's forehead. His vision blurred red as he staggered back, eyes watering.\n\nThrough the haze, he saw her clearly now: **sword in her right hand, gun in her left.**\n\nThe **Demon Slayer's Use Both Hands** passive, unlocked at level 300.\n\nKraugel's lips curved into a rare smile.\n\n\"...Interesting.\"\n\nHe'd been hit twice in a row. His body began to glow with a faint blue aura—**sword energy** coiling around him like a living thing.\n\nHe recognized her now. Not as a rival, but as an **equal**.\n\nSomeone on **Grid's level**.\n\nBut before he could test that theory—\n\n\"**Hell Leap.**\"\n\nYura vanished again.\n\nThis time, Kraugel watched carefully. A black hole opened beneath her feet, swallowing her whole. No spatial distortion. No mana signature. No warning.\n\nShe didn't just become invisible—she *left reality itself.*\n\nThe moment she entered that void, she disappeared completely from his senses. Even **Super Sensitivity** couldn't track her.\n\n\"...Demon Slayer.\"\n\nKraugel murmured the words as he stared at the spot where she'd stood. His gaze drifted toward the distant treeline, where Yura had already reappeared hundreds of meters away.\n\nHis feelings mirrored the first time he'd faced **Grid**.\n\nRespect. Wariness. And something close to excitement.\n\n---\n\n\"**WAAAAAAAAH!**\"\n\n\"YURA! YURA! YURA!\"\n\n\"MY GODDESS HAS RETURNED!\"\n\nThe stadium exploded.\n\nYura, who had spent months wandering in obscurity after obtaining her Legendary Class, had just reclaimed her throne.\n\nThis wasn't just a comeback.\n\nIt was a **declaration**."
