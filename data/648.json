  "content": "Grid shared everything he'd witnessed on the East Continent with the Overgeared Guild. The intelligence was too valuable to keep to himself—his forces needed every advantage they could get. Now, the think tank was hard at work, transforming raw observations into actionable knowledge.\n\nLauel's team dissected the information with surgical precision, mapping out power structures, political systems, ideologies, cultural norms, economic frameworks, and military capabilities. But one topic dominated the discussion.\n\nThe yangbans.\n\n\"Grid classified Garam as legend-tier.\" One of the strategists leaned forward. \"He fought the man personally, so we can't just dismiss that assessment. But here's what bothers me—could Garam actually go toe-to-toe with a great demon?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\" Another analyst nodded. \"Grid reported that Garam's offensive and defensive capabilities far exceed Belial's. Lower health pool, sure, but in a straight fight? Garam wins. He'd be equivalent to an upper-ranked great demon at minimum.\"\n\n\"I disagree.\" A third voice cut in. \"Great demons will always have the edge. Remember Belial's hell domain? We only survived because Yura's Demon Slayer class hard-countered the effect. In any normal scenario, we'd have been fighting in literal hell.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" The second analyst shifted position. \"Belial became exponentially stronger in that environment. I don't care how powerful the yangbans are—they'd be prey in a great demon's domain.\"\n\n\"So yangbans are stronger than legendary players but weaker than great demons?\"\n\n\"Makes sense from a balance perspective. Think about it. The yangbans are residents of the Hwan Kingdom, right? If they could steamroll great demons, what would that do to the game's ecosystem?\"\n\n\"The yangbans would just clear out hell completely.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nJishuka had been listening quietly. Now she turned to Han Seokbong.\n\n\"Are you familiar with the great demons? Do people on the East Continent know about them?\"\n\n\"Of course. We consider them humanity's greatest enemy.\"\n\n\"Then have the yangbans ever fought them? Directly?\"\n\n\"No.\" Han Seokbong shook his head. \"They don't engage. Instead, the Hwan Kingdom sealed hell's entrance—they placed the Blue Dragon Dao in the eastern Kaya Kingdom, the White Tiger Spear in the western Pa Kingdom, the Red Phoenix Bow in the southern Cho Kingdom, and the Black Tortoise Jewel in the northern Xing Kingdom.\"\n\n\"The sacred artifacts Grid mentioned...\"\n\n\"See?\" The skeptical analyst jumped back in. \"Why would the Hwan Kingdom seal hell if they could just crush the great demons? They're avoiding the fight because they'd lose. This whole debate about yangbans being stronger than great demons is pointless.\"\n\nThe room buzzed with renewed discussion.\n\n\"Wrong.\" Lauel's voice silenced the chatter as he entered the meeting room. \"The Hwan Kingdom isn't sealing hell because they're weak. They're preserving their value.\"\n\n\"Value?\"\n\nEvery eye turned to him. Even Han Seokbong leaned in.\n\n\"Tell me something.\" Lauel fixed his gaze on Han Seokbong. \"Does the East Continent have a myth about how 'the enemy who descends to the mortal realm will be repelled by the Hwan Kingdom, and peace will reign'?\"\n\n\"How—how did you know that?\"\n\n\"Because it's obvious.\" Lauel's smile was sharp. \"From what Grid told us, the Hwan Kingdom has ruled the East Continent since the beginning. Every other kingdom has served them since the dawn of history. That only makes sense if the Hwan Kingdom played a critical role in the continent's creation. Which means...\" He let the pause hang. \"They've built their entire legitimacy around being necessary.\"\n\n\"So you're saying...\" Jishuka's eyes widened. \"The Hwan Kingdom deliberately portrays the great demons as this apocalyptic threat to maintain their status?\"\n\n\"Precisely. The East Continent believes peace depends on the Hwan Kingdom. They'll keep worshiping them as long as that belief holds. The yangbans aren't sealing hell to protect their rice bowl because they're weak—they're doing it to stay relevant.\"\n\n\"But if Grid considers them legend-tier...\"\n\n\"Then they're definitely not weaker than great demons.\" Lauel shrugged. \"And frankly, it would be terrible design if hell was the endgame. Too simple.\"\n\nHe could see it now—the real story would begin after the great demons fell. The ensuing power vacuum would trigger a massive player conflict. New narratives would constantly emerge. And the Hwan Kingdom would become a wildcard in that chaos.\n\n*The S.A. Group is nasty.*\n\nWell, whatever.\n\n\"Actually, it works in our favor that the Hwan Kingdom isn't engaging the great demons.\" Lauel's grin widened as he brought his hand up to cover half his face. \"Because the great demons are the Overgeared Kingdom's prey. Kukukuk!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nHan Seokbong stared at Lauel's covered face, baffled. \"Why does he do that every time he laughs?\"\n\n\"...Trust me, you're better off not knowing.\" Jishuka's smile was strained.\n\nHan Seokbong decided not to press the issue.\n\nSticks entered the meeting room, summoned by Lauel's earlier message.\n\n\"The return scroll to the West Continent.\" Lauel's hand finally dropped. \"Can you make one large enough to transport tens of thousands of people? We need to bring Pangea's population over.\"\n\n\"Impossible.\" Sticks shook his head. \"The large scroll I gave Grid took decades to produce. I made it while staying on the Behen Archipelago.\"\n\n\"Decades...\" Lauel's enthusiasm dimmed. \"What if we reduced the passenger count? And forget intercontinental—could we use it as a tactical weapon here on the West Continent?\"\n\n\"You're describing a Mass Teleport scroll. Those take fifteen years minimum, assuming I focus on nothing else.\"\n\n\"...Never mind.\"\n\nSage Sticks had too many critical roles to waste fifteen years on a single project.\n\n\"Forget the Hwan Kingdom and yangbans for now.\" Lauel shifted gears. \"We're on the West Continent, not the East Continent. Our immediate problem is the empire.\"\n\nTwo months of tribute payments to the Saharan Empire had bled the Overgeared Kingdom dry. They'd been forced to halt all major investments, redirecting everything toward agriculture just to keep the population fed.\n\nJishuka spoke carefully. \"This isn't sustainable. Are we really going to war with the empire?\"\n\nThe question hung heavy. Everyone knew the truth—they'd rather die fighting than slowly wither away like slaves. Lauel nodded.\n\n\"Of course we're fighting. But we won't be the ones bleeding.\"\n\nHis smile turned predatory—reminiscent of Grid's old troublemaker grin. It was a terrifying expression on an enemy, but reassuring when he was on your side.\n\n\"I'm sending a small elite force to join the Ares Army. Grid will lead it.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Ares?\"\n\nThe God of War. The strongest unofficial ranker, estimated to exceed even sun-grade players. Kraugel had mentioned fighting one of Ares' subordinates back when Kraugel still held first place on the rankings.\n\n\"Wait.\" Someone raised a hand. \"Shouldn't we be treating the Ares Army as a potential threat? Why help them?\"\n\n\"Didn't they just lose to the empire two months ago? Massive casualties. Are they even worth the investment?\"\n\n\"Ares' forces are already restored.\" Lauel's tone was matter-of-fact. \"According to Kraugel's intelligence, one of Ares' key skills is Conscription. It lets him rapidly rebuild his military.\"\n\n\"So what's the objective?\"\n\n\"We make Ares a king. Form an alliance. Work together to pressure the empire.\" Lauel pulled up a map. \"Ares is currently operating in the Belto Kingdom—opposite side of the empire from us. If we coordinate, we can attack from two fronts.\"\n\n\"Split the empire's attention?\"\n\n\"Correct. When their surveillance on us weakens, we rebuild.\"\n\n\"It's a solid plan.\" Jishuka frowned. \"But what if we're creating a new monster while trying to escape the current one?\"\n\n\"What choice do we have?\" Lauel spread his hands. \"The monster in front of us is about to devour us. And let's be honest—the Ares Army will become a monster eventually regardless of what we do.\"\n\nJust not yet.\n\n\"Even if we have to deal with them later, we use them now to survive. As long as the empire remains a threat, we'll have a reliable ally. Plus...\" His sly smile deepened. \"We'll gather intelligence on a future enemy.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"I'll brief the team being deployed. They'll conceal any abilities that haven't been publicly demonstrated. Hold back thirty percent of their power. Observe the Ares Army's capabilities.\" He paused. \"Grid will hold back sixty percent.\"\n\nLauel was certain the operatives would gain valuable experience. There was much to learn from the Ares Army.\n\n\"Trust me. This operation will yield significant returns.\"\n\n***\n\n**[Supreme Ruler]**\n\n*Rating: SSS*\n\n*The ultimate combat passive skill, ranking alongside God's Command and Divine Dominion.*\n\n*Physical attack power permanently increased by 20%. All skills and magic permanently increased by 10%.*\n\n*Basic attacks have a 30% chance to deal double damage.*\n\nThe acquisition requirement—hunt one of the top twenty users in any class—made Supreme Ruler nearly impossible to obtain.\n\nFor Agnus, it had been easy.\n\n\"The Rune of Death has been very productive...\" He examined the skill window with satisfaction. \"Useful in so many ways.\"\n\nAs he deflected Mumud's blade—the lich stubbornly resisting his control—a whisper arrived.\n\n—*You just obtained Supreme Ruler? Congratulations.*\n\n—*Kikikik, you're like a damn ghost, you know that?*\n\nVeradin. A genius strategist who'd been compared to Lauel since the days of the Ten Rookies. Agnus was still somewhat baffled that Veradin had chosen to serve him—he didn't think anyone could tolerate his personality.\n\n*At first, I figured he was just trying to leech off me.*\n\nAgnus chuckled at the memory.\n\n—*Yeah, finally got it. Took forever though. You kept begging me not to hunt the Overgeared members, so I had to find other prey.*\n\n—*Because the Overgeared Kingdom's true capabilities remain unknown.*\n\n—*You sound like a broken record. How much longer do I have to play nice? Why am I avoiding those people?*\n\n—*It's over.*\n\n—*Kik?*\n\n—*Now you announce yourself to the Overgeared Kingdom. Use everything. All the restraint you've shown, all the humiliation you've endured—it was for this moment.*\n\n—*...Kikikik, what are you plotting now?*\n\n—*I guarantee the Overgeared Kingdom will contact the Ares Army soon. The empire has both of them backed against a wall. They'll ally against their common enemy.*\n\nVeradin had studied the Overgeared Guild through every available media source. He'd profiled Lauel's psychological patterns. Agnus knew Veradin's predictions were rarely wrong.\n\n—*You'll be with the empire. The perfect opportunity to crush multiple powerful enemies simultaneously.*\n\n\"...Kil! Kikikik!\"\n\nAgnus' grin stretched ear to ear. His shoulders shook with laughter.\n\n\"Playing with Kraugel was fun...\"\n\nHe hoped these new toys would be interesting. Entertaining enough to make him forget his miserable existence, even if just for a moment.\n\nAgnus' golden eyes gleamed with anticipation.\n\nBaal's Contractor. The madman destined to oppose Grid forever.\n\nThe conflict was inevitable."
