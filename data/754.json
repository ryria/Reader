  "content": "# The Sword Saint's Pride\n\n## Bruton Island – Saint Sword Drawing Finals\n\nA lion doesn't stalk a rabbit with caution. Why would it? The disparity is absolute. Patience and overwhelming force—these are the fundamentals of a predator's nature. True wariness is reserved for equals.\n\n*Clang!*\n\nSteel sang against steel as Kraugel pressed his assault. This wasn't the methodical hunt of a superior force toying with prey. The Sword Saint treated Yura as a genuine threat—perhaps the only compliment one ranker could pay another.\n\nHis silver eyes tracked every shift in her stance. *She has the qualifications. I can't afford hesitation.*\n\nThe gap was narrow but decisive. Kraugel hadn't reached his third awakening before the competition—hadn't hit level 300. His stats lagged behind where they should be. Which meant he couldn't give her an inch. Not one.\n\nHis hand drifted to his sheath.\n\nYura's trajectory crystallized in his mind three seconds before she committed to it. He could see the path she'd take—the optimal route to the safety zone. She was fast, but predictable.\n\n*End this before she reaches sanctuary.*\n\nThe sheath clicked open.\n\n**Space Sword.**\n\nReality fractured.\n\nWhite Fang screamed from its prison of leather and wood, and the world *split*. Earth severed. Rivers divided mid-flow. Trees fell in perfect halves, their trunks smoking at the cut. Mountains groaned as fissures carved through bedrock. Even the sky itself seemed to tear along the path of Kraugel's blade—a wound in the fabric of existence.\n\nEverything in his field of vision collapsed into two pieces.\n\nEverything except Yura.\n\n\"—!\"\n\nAt the precise microsecond the blade would have bisected her, she *vanished*. A black hole yawned open beneath her feet, swallowing her whole. **Hell Leap**—the signature escape technique of the Demon Slayer class.\n\nKraugel's sword carved through empty air.\n\n---\n\n**—Damn!**\n\n**—Did you see that timing?!**\n\n**—She made Space Sword completely worthless...**\n\nThe crowd erupted. Dozens of similar exchanges had already occurred throughout the match, and each time Yura demonstrated why she'd earned her legend before Kraugel ever touched his. The gap between Sword Saint and Demon Slayer wasn't a chasm—it was a razor's edge.\n\nIf the classes were truly equal, many thought, she wouldn't be running at all.\n\nBut the spectators were wrong.\n\nKraugel dominated. Subtly. Inexorably. In every microscopic decision, every fractional exchange of positioning, he held the advantage. Not overwhelming—but absolute.\n\n---\n\n\"Nowhere left to run.\"\n\n\"...?!\"\n\nYura tumbled out of her black hole portal and froze.\n\nKraugel stood directly in her path.\n\n*Impossible. He predicted—no.* Her chest tightened. *I was predictable.*\n\nThe shortest route to the safety zone. The most obvious path. She'd chosen speed over deception, and Kraugel had read her like a children's book. Anxiety had made her sloppy.\n\nHer own desperation had sealed her defeat.\n\nWhite Fang flashed.\n\n**[You have suffered 5,900 damage.]**\n\nThe world tilted. Pain exploded across her ribcage as the legendary blade carved through her armor like tissue paper. She tried to pivot, to create space—\n\n*Crack!*\n\nThe sword came again. And again.\n\nKraugel's assault wasn't flashy. No wasted movements. No dramatic flourishes. Each strike targeted openings that appeared for fractions of a second—gaps in her guard she didn't even know existed. His **Super Sensitivity** painted her every move in stark clarity, his analytical mind three steps ahead of her physical reactions.\n\n\"Ngh—!\"\n\nRed flashed across Yura's vision with each blow. She raised her gun in desperation, squeezing off rounds even as her health plummeted.\n\n*Bang! Bang!*\n\nKraugel's head shifted left. Then right. His footwork was immaculate—he'd already moved before she pulled the trigger, reading her gaze and the angle of the barrel.\n\nTen shots fired.\n\nEight missed.\n\nMeanwhile, Kraugel landed seven of eight strikes. The health gap yawned wider with each passing second.\n\n---\n\n**『 It's over. 』**\n\n**『 God... Player Yura fought so brilliantly, and now she's going to miss the medal entirely. 』**\n\nThe commentators' voices carried a funeral tone. Throughout Saint Sword Drawing, Yura had been magnificent. Her strategy was flawless, her execution near-perfect. She'd overcome every obstacle through a combination of raw skill and tactical genius.\n\nSouth Korea had been counting on her.\n\nBut Kraugel was about to crush that dream beneath his heel.\n\n**『 As we've discussed, the Korean roster is shallow. Beyond Grid, Yura, Peak Sword, and Toon, they have no notable participants. 』**\n\n**『 Analysts project that only Grid and Yura had legitimate chances at gold. Everyone else caps out at silver—maybe. 』**\n\n**『 Yura's elimination without a medal is catastrophic for South Korea's overall performance. 』**\n\n**『 Heartbreaking. The Korean fans must be devastated. 』**\n\nThe math was brutal. With the new rules limiting participants to two events each, losing Yura meant losing South Korea's second-strongest competitor. Even if Grid swept both his events—unlikely against this field—Korea would still languish at the bottom of the rankings.\n\nNo buffs. No glory.\n\nJust disappointment.\n\n---\n\n\"**Meteor Sword.**\"\n\n*BOOM!*\n\n*CRASH! CRASH! CRASH!*\n\nKraugel's blade fell like a collapsing star, each impact cratering the earth around Yura's battered form. She activated defensive skills, burned through cooldowns—nothing mattered. Her health had dipped to critical levels while Kraugel remained near full strength.\n\nThe gap between them was undeniable now.\n\nLast year's Kraugel had been formidable. This year's Kraugel—upgraded to Sword Saint—was a different species of player entirely. Several tiers above Yura's current capabilities.\n\nThe match was decided. Spectators were already looking ahead to the next event, mentally tabulating potential medal counts.\n\nKraugel prepared to deliver the finishing blow.\n\n*End her cleanly.*\n\nHis mind calculated with cold precision. He'd measured her remaining health against his damage output—knew exactly how much force the final strike required. He activated a charging skill, positioning for a heart-shot that would simultaneously create distance. **Immortality** would proc, giving her five seconds of invulnerability—but five seconds at this range meant nothing. She'd never reach the safety zone.\n\n\"**Jajinmori.**\"\n\n*Thud!*\n\nThe kick came from nowhere—a secret technique plundered from the East Continent. No telegraphing. No wind-up. Just instant, overwhelming force slamming into Yura's abdomen.\n\nHer health hit zero.\n\n**Immortality** activated.\n\nShe went flying backward, tumbling across scorched grass, the distance between them expanding to thirty meters. Kraugel didn't pursue. No need. Even with five seconds of invincibility, she couldn't cross that gap *and* reach the sanctuary before time expired.\n\nCheckmate.\n\n---\n\n\"Hehe...\"\n\nDespite everything—despite her desperate situation—Yura *laughed*.\n\nKraugel's eyes narrowed. That sound wasn't despair.\n\nYura had anticipated this exact scenario. Kraugel's tactical mind was legendary, yes, but it was also *consistent*. Predictable in its perfection. And now, with thirty meters between them...\n\nShe had just enough time.\n\n\"**Hell Summoning.**\"\n\n\"—?!\"\n\n*KRRRRRRRRUMBLE!*\n\nThe sky cracked open.\n\nDemon Slayers paid a harsh price for their specialization. Overwhelming power in hell. Crippling penalties everywhere else. On paper, it was a garbage legendary class—what good was strength you could only use in one environment?\n\nBut **Hell Summoning** was the answer to that limitation.\n\nFor one precious minute, Yura could drag hell itself into the mortal world.\n\n*Shhhhhhhhhh—*\n\nDarkness erupted. Black tendrils of demonic energy poured from a rupture in space, flooding outward in a kilometer-wide radius. The brilliant afternoon sunshine vanished behind a curtain of corruption. Bruton Island's pristine landscape warped and twisted, grass withering, stones cracking, the very air screaming in agony.\n\nWithin seconds, paradise became a circle of damnation.\n\n**『 Oh my god...! 』**\n\nThe commentators' voices cracked. The global audience watching from hundreds of countries collectively held its breath.\n\nHell Summoning—the signature ability of **Great Demon Belial**. A field magic so powerful it was reserved for raid bosses.\n\nAnd Yura had just cast it.\n\n\"Tch.\"\n\nEven Kraugel's composure faltered. Corruption washed over him like acid rain.\n\n**[You have entered hell.]**\n\n**[You are affected by a strong evil energy.]**\n\n**[Your body is exhausted. Attack power, defense, and agility will decrease by 30%.]**\n\n**[Health won't recover naturally.]**\n\n**[You have received a mental blow. Mana regeneration rate will slow by 50%.]**\n\n**[You have resisted.]**\n\n*Status Resistance is meaningless here.*\n\nThe penalties stacked regardless. Kraugel's legendary class perks could soften the blow, but they couldn't negate hell's fundamental wrongness. This was Yura's world now.\n\nHe tightened his grip on White Fang.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nYura launched herself across a river of bubbling hellfire, closing the distance in a heartbeat. Three **Joint Attacks** came simultaneously—gun blazing, blade singing, her body a blur of lethal intent.\n\nFaster than before. *Much* faster.\n\n*She was holding back.* Kraugel's respect for his opponent notched higher even as he wove through her onslaught. *Smart.*\n\nEvery player at the National Competition faced the same dilemma: reveal your trump cards to the entire world, or keep secrets and risk elimination? Most chose to hide their full strength for as long as possible.\n\nBut then... why reveal it *now*?\n\n*This doesn't change the outcome.*\n\nThe health gap was still massive. Even with hell's buffs amplifying Yura's stats, even with Kraugel suffering harsh penalties—he still held an overwhelming advantage. She'd needed to summon hell *earlier* or not at all.\n\nPlaying this card now was just delaying the inevitable.\n\nKraugel sidestepped two bullets that screamed from the darkness, their trajectories illuminated by hellfire. He endured the searing heat licking at his boots, calculated the exact instant Yura's **Immortality** would expire, and thrust—\n\n*Swish!*\n\nHis blade cut nothing.\n\nThe landscape had transformed too rapidly. Kraugel's spatial awareness—one of his greatest assets—faltered for half a second as his mind struggled to reorient. Rivers of lava where grass had been. Twisted spires where trees had stood.\n\nThat half-second was enough.\n\nYura activated **Hell Leap** and vanished, burning her last dregs of mana in a desperate retreat.\n\n*Toward the safety zone.*\n\n*I won't let you—!*\n\nKraugel exploded forward with **White Light Steps**, his body a silver blur.\n\n**KIYAAAAAOOOOHHH!**\n\n\"—?!\"\n\n*BOOM!*\n\nThe sky *screamed*.\n\nKraugel's head snapped up. His enhanced perception registered the threat a microsecond before his mind could process what he was seeing.\n\nA **Hell Bone Dragon** erupted from a tear in the corrupted heavens, its skeletal form wreathed in purple flames. Thousands of hellish eyes boiled in the void behind it—a window into the abyss itself. The creature opened its maw and exhaled.\n\nPoisonous breath, thick as tar and twice as corrosive, engulfed Kraugel.\n\n\"Kuh—!\"\n\nThe Sword Saint *screamed*—a raw, involuntary sound of agony that shocked even himself—and went flying backward. His armor melted. His health plummeted. Critical damage warnings flashed across his vision.\n\nA hell bone dragon. A named monster so dangerous it required raid-level coordination to defeat. Yura's hell summoning had randomly pulled from one of its habitats.\n\nPure, idiotic, beautiful luck.\n\n---\n\n*Shhhhhhhhhhhh...*\n\nThe darkness receded.\n\nHell's duration expired after barely sixty seconds—but sixty seconds had been enough. The landscape snapped back to Bruton Island's original state, grass and trees whole again, as if the corruption had never existed.\n\nExcept for one critical detail.\n\nYura stood in the safety zone, gasping for breath, one hand pressed against the stone where the saint sword rested.\n\nFirst.\n\n**『 Y...YURA...! 』**\n\n**『 SOUTH KOREA'S YURA WILL CLAIM THE SAINT SWORD! 』**\n\nWho could have imagined? Someone defeating Kraugel—the Sky Above the Sky—in single combat? Most of the world's analysts insisted even Grid would lose head-to-head against the Sword Saint's perfect technique.\n\nYet Yura had done it.\n\nThrough strategy, sacrifice, and a single stroke of miraculous fortune—\n\n*Thud.*\n\n\"...!\"\n\n**『 ....!! 』**\n\nOne step.\n\nShe was one step short.\n\nBefore Yura could fully cross the threshold into the safety zone's protection, dozens of ethereal swords materialized from thin air. They screamed toward her in a silver tempest—a Sword Saint's long-range technique that manifested weapons directly from inventory space.\n\nTen swords. Twenty. Thirty. All aimed at her legs.\n\nIt was one of Kraugel's hidden techniques. Something he'd been saving for Grid.\n\n\"Ah—!\"\n\n*Shink!*\n\nA blade pierced her ankle, the steel point erupting through the other side. Yura's potion saved her life—barely—but momentum died. Her body pitched forward, collapsing just inside the safety zone's boundary.\n\nAs she fell—\n\n*Whoosh!*\n\nKraugel *leapt* over her prone form.\n\nHis hand closed around the saint sword's hilt.\n\nOne second before hers would have.\n\n---\n\n**『 K-KRAUGEL WINS! KRAUGEL DRAWS THE SAINT SWORD FIRST—GOLD MEDAL TO THE UNITED STATES! 』**\n\n**『 Ahhh... Player Yura takes the silver. So, so close. But what a phenomenal performance. Truly magnificent. 』**\n\n\"**WAAAAAAHHHHH!**\"\n\nThe Tokyo Dome erupted. Seventy thousand voices screaming as one, a tsunami of noise that rattled the rafters.\n\nThe first premier event of the 3rd National Competition—fierce, gorgeous, unforgettable.\n\n---\n\n## Korean Team – Waiting Room\n\n\"You fought beautifully.\"\n\nGrid's voice was quiet. Steady.\n\nOn screen, Yura wept. Not delicate tears—full, body-shaking sobs. The strongest woman in South Korea, the Goddess of their gaming scene, looking more fragile than anyone had ever seen her.\n\nShe'd achieved her legend before Kraugel. She'd grown faster, climbed higher, secured her class when he was still chasing his. By every metric, she should have matched him.\n\nBut she'd lost.\n\nWas it effort? No. Grid knew better than anyone that Yura's dedication was absolute.\n\nNo.\n\n*It's talent.*\n\nThe bitter truth that Grid had learned the hard way, over and over. Humanity was comparative. Someone praised as the best would still feel small standing beside someone greater. Grid had experienced that crushing realization dozens of times.\n\nWhich meant he understood exactly what Yura felt right now.\n\nHer despair. Her fury. Her helplessness.\n\n*I'll avenge you.*\n\nTalent?\n\n*I'll crush it beneath a mountain of legendary equipment.*\n\nGrid's blood sang with determination. Witnessing Kraugel's transcendent skill—seeing Yura broken by it—only fueled his resolve.\n\nHe would win.\n\nFor her. For Korea.\n\nFor everyone who'd ever been told they weren't good enough.\n\n---\n\n## Day One Results\n\nFour more events concluded after Saint Sword Drawing.\n\nSouth Korea won nothing.\n\nWhen the first day's rankings were tallied, Korea's medal count stood at a single silver. One. Against powerhouse nations fielding dozens of rankers, it seemed pathetic.\n\nBut that silver medal—Yura's silver medal—had weight beyond its material.\n\nSouth Korea, projected to languish at the absolute bottom of the rankings, had somehow clawed their way into the upper third. Not dominant. Not impressive.\n\nBut *present*.\n\nAt that moment, with twenty-nine events still remaining, no one understood the significance.\n\nNo one realized what that small, precious difference would eventually mean."
