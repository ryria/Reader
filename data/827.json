  "content": "A limited-edition supercar—one of only three in the world—turned heads on every stretch of highway. In an East Asian country unaccustomed to such extravagance, traffic parted like water. The owner, Lim Cheolho, made better time than he'd anticipated.\n\nLate autumn foliage blurred past the windows as he drove into the suburbs. The changing scenery helped settle his nerves.\n\nGrid was young, successful, and owned his own building. Most people his age would've moved out, pursued independence, enjoyed the rewards of their labor. But Grid hadn't. He'd stayed with his parents and sister, kept playing the game that had made him successful. That spoke volumes about his character.\n\nWhich meant Lim Cheolho couldn't arrive empty-handed—not when he was about to ask for a favor, and especially not when Grid's family would be there.\n\nBut what gift?\n\nHe'd never had to worry about such things before.\n\n\"Morpheus.\"\n\n[Yes.]\n\nThe world's most advanced supercomputer—the system that maintained Satisfy itself—responded instantly to its creator's call.\n\n\"What's the most appropriate gift for a high school girl about to enter university, and a couple in their mid-fifties?\"\n\n[Top gift for the high school demographic: full cosmetic surgery package. Top gift for the couple's age bracket: divorce papers.]\n\nThe answer came in under a second, drawn from millions of data points across countless servers.\n\nLim Cheolho blinked. As humanity's foremost scientist, he trusted data. He also possessed common sense. The surgery certificate made a certain twisted sense, but showing up as a guest bearing divorce papers?\n\n\"What are the second and third most popular gifts for that demographic?\"\n\n[Luxury skincare treatments and international travel vouchers.]\n\n\"Perfect. We'll go with those.\"\n\n[Initiating purchase of plastic surgery certificate from highest-rated provider with best pricing. Acceptable?]\n\n\"Yes. Order the skincare and travel packages as well—best quality, most competitive price.\"\n\n[Confirmed.]\n\nLim Cheolho smiled as the digital certificates arrived on his phone. The supercar accelerated through the suburbs, arriving at Grid's building minutes later.\n\n\"A bit outside Seoul, but the air quality's excellent.\"\n\n[Fine particulate density well within acceptable parameters.]\n\n\"It's a nice neighborhood.\"\n\nLim Cheolho stepped out of the car, taking in his surroundings. Flower gardens surrounded Grid's building, peaceful enough that couples sat on benches sipping coffee. Across the street stood more residential buildings.\n\n\"Those belong to other Overgeared members?\"\n\n[Correct. Yura, Jishuka, Regas, and Pon. Analysis suggests the latter three will relocate to South Korea within the next few months.]\n\nWarmth spread through Lim Cheolho's chest. To see bonds forged in Satisfy manifest in reality—it moved him deeply.\n\n\"The young people who love Satisfy are truly a blessing.\"\n\nIt confirmed what he'd always believed. Grid's devotion to Satisfy matched his own. Grid had found a new life through the game. Of course he'd want it to succeed.\n\nHe'll understand. He'll agree to my request.\n\nLim Cheolho's steps were light as he took the elevator to the top floor. The doors opened to reveal a man standing in the hallway, brushing his teeth—Toon, former Italian mafia turned Satisfy high ranker, now a core Overgeared member and Grid's personal bodyguard. Another life transformed by the game.\n\n\"I'm very glad to meet you.\" Lim Cheolho beamed with pride.\n\nToon studied him with blank confusion. \"Do I know you?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Can't let you past without an appointment.\" Toon blocked the hallway, still working his toothbrush around his mouth. He'd clearly just woken up.\n\nLim Cheolho kept smiling. \"You must be tired.\"\n\nAfter all, he was *Lim Cheolho*. His face had been in newspapers daily since Satisfy's launch, perpetually trending in online searches. He was welcomed everywhere, by everyone.\n\nHow could any Satisfy player—let alone a high ranker—not recognize him? The man must be groggy from sleep.\n\nBut Lim Cheolho had misjudged the situation. Toon's life had been too hard, too isolated, for him to pay attention to celebrities from other worlds.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nAbsurd. Lim Cheolho struggled for words before recovering his composure.\n\n\"Morpheus, call Grid's parents.\"\n\n[Mother or father?]\n\n\"Whichever answers faster.\"\n\n[Understood.]\n\nThe man blocking the hallway exuded quiet menace—sleek muscle, wolf's eyes, the bearing of someone who'd survived violence. For the first time in years, Lim Cheolho felt himself categorized as a potential threat.\n\nMorpheus connected the call.\n\n*(Hello?)*\n\n\"Is this Shin Youngwoo's father?\"\n\n*(That's right...)*\n\n\"Hello! I'm Lim Cheolho, chairman of S.A. Group. I'm delighted to—\"\n\n*Click.*\n\n\"...\"\n\nChairman Lim Cheolho had spent years immersed in corporate and official functions, cut off from ordinary life. He'd forgotten how his name must sound to normal people.\n\nThey think I'm a scammer.\n\nComplete impasse. To suffer this humiliation at such a critical moment—\n\n*Ding.*\n\nThe elevator behind him opened. A girl in a school uniform stepped out—Sehee.\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\nThey stared at each other, equally surprised.\n\n*She doesn't use filters on her profile photos or character?* Lim Cheolho was struck by how perfectly Sehee's real face matched her in-game appearance.\n\n*Why is he at our house?* Sehee recognized the chairman immediately.\n\n\"H-Hello.\" Unlike her brother, Sehee was polite even through her confusion, bowing respectfully.\n\nLim Cheolho's expression softened. \"Hello! What a surprise. I may have prepared the wrong gift.\"\n\nHe'd have to refund that surgery certificate immediately.\n\nSehee noticed his contemplative look and smiled brightly. \"Are you here to celebrate my brother's birthday?\"\n\n\"...Hm?\"\n\nLim Cheolho's gaze dropped to the cake in her hands.\n\n[Top birthday gift for males in their late twenties: Satisfy luxury capsule. Second choice: epic-rated or higher in-game item.]\n\n\"He already has better than that.\"\n\nLim Cheolho had come to reclaim an item, not give one. Still—this wasn't a bad development. He looked forward to meeting Grid.\n\n***\n\n\"What is it now?\"\n\nShin Youngwoo grumbled as he logged out, forced offline by Sehee's persistent calls. He still had ninety minutes of connection time left—plenty to accomplish in Satisfy. His sister's urgency annoyed him.\n\nThough he had to admit, the Comet Group's diamond capsule was worth every won. Despite lying down for over twelve hours, his hair wasn't a mess and his body felt perfectly limber. Such were the luxuries ordinary people never experienced.\n\n\"Where'd she go after calling me out?\"\n\nYoungwoo surveyed his office—a spacious room containing only the capsule and a mini-fridge. Finding himself alone, he headed toward the living room.\n\nThen stopped.\n\n\"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!\"\n\n\"Congratulations!\"\n\nSehee and Yerim launched into a confetti assault, grinning wildly.\n\nYoungwoo's expression went blank. Birthday messages and decorations covered the living room walls. A party table had been set up, complete with cake and food.\n\n\"Is it my birthday today?\"\n\n\"I knew you'd forget.\" Sehee pouted. \"Did you even eat? I left seaweed soup this morning but you never came down for lunch.\"\n\nHis parents joined in.\n\n\"Working hard to earn money is good, but you need proper nutrition! What's the point of being Korean if you don't eat rice?\"\n\n\"It's good you don't smoke, but you should eat regular meals like your sister says.\"\n\n\"Yeah...\" Youngwoo smiled ruefully, nodding. Looking at his parents, Sehee, Yerim, and even Toon—who'd become like family—all gathered around the birthday table... despite forgetting his own birthday, he was moved they'd remembered. Toon especially seemed emotional, eyes reddening with tears. As an orphan, celebrating birthdays held special meaning for him.\n\nBut amid this warm family atmosphere—\n\n\"By the way... why is the chairman here?\"\n\nYoungwoo took his seat, addressing Lim Cheolho directly. Both wore equally awkward expressions.\n\nWho could've expected this development?"
