Once they'd made sufficient progress, he turned to Kasim.\n\n\"I need to ask you for a favor,\" Grid said. \"It's... extremely personal.\"\n\nKasim's eyes narrowed as he considered the request. After a long pause, he gave a slow nod. \"Understood.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" A smile tugged at Grid's lips. \"I appreciate it.\"\n\nWith that matter settled, Grid summoned Lauel to an office he'd barely touched since acquiring it—a spacious room that had sat empty and unused for months.\n\n\"Why don't you take over this space?\" Grid gestured around the chamber. \"It's several times larger than your current office.\"\n\nLauel handled every aspect of guild operations and territorial management. The least Grid could do was provide him with a proper workspace.\n\n\"You've granted me considerable authority as your proxy,\" Lauel replied, his tone measured and formal. \"But in the end, I am not you. I wouldn't dare permanently occupy a place where you should sit.\"\n\n*He's been watching too many historical dramas.* Grid suppressed a grin as Lauel settled into his role as the loyal retainer. \"Alright, if you insist.\"\n\nLauel then briefed him on Overgeared's current situation. As the report progressed, Grid's expression darkened.\n\n\"I can't understand what Peak Sword is thinking.\"\n\nLosing Cork Island was inevitable—they'd known that from the start. The territory sat too far from their core holdings to defend indefinitely. Both Lauel and Grid had accepted this reality when they committed to the war. The benefits had simply outweighed the costs. Overgeared had grown exponentially: two new territories, Earl Ashur's allegiance, and seven thousand Patrian soldiers absorbed into their ranks.\n\nBut for Peak Sword, Cork Island meant something more. He absolutely refused to surrender it. \n\nGrid finally understood.\n\n\"I'll go to Cork Island,\" he declared.\n\nMilitary service in the Korean army had taught him how to defend a position. Grid was confident he could hold Cork Island for months—even years if necessary.\n\n\"It's my land. I have to protect it.\"\n\nThe thought of leaving Peak Sword to bear that burden alone made Grid's chest tighten. But Lauel immediately shook his head.\n\n\"That's impossible. If your growth stagnates, the entire Overgeared Guild suffers. We can't afford that loss.\"\n\n\"I can't just abandon Peak Sword.\"\n\nAmong all his valued colleagues, Peak Sword held a special place. The man had promoted Grid everywhere—to anyone who would listen. \"Do you know God Grid?\" had become his catchphrase. He'd cheered for Grid, trusted him, supported him, and ultimately handed over both his guild and territory without hesitation. Grid couldn't fully repay that loyalty, but he couldn't ignore Peak Sword in his hour of need either.\n\n\"I'll help him defend the island. Don't worry about my growth.\" Grid's jaw set stubbornly. \"If I stay on Cork Island crafting items for the soldiers, my stats and skills will continue improving. I can grow stronger anywhere.\"\n\nOf course, the rate of progression would pale compared to hunting and leveling. But before Grid could dig in his heels further—\n\nA whisper arrived from Peak Sword.\n\n—*God Grid, don't come. I know it sounds funny coming from me, but Cork Island is just the tip of Overgeared's spear. We can't hold it forever. You coming here would be a waste of your time.*\n\nLauel's doing. When Grid had insisted on going, Lauel had clearly contacted Peak Sword directly.\n\n—*God Grid, you're the master. I'm just a guild member—the responsibilities I bear can't compare to yours. Don't lose focus worrying about one member. Prioritize what you need to do. Become strong enough to retake Cork Island whenever you want.*\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid's protests died in his throat. He understood his priorities, even if he didn't like them. Finally, he nodded in acceptance of Peak Sword's sacrifice.\n\n\"Then I'll go to the East Continent instead.\"\n\nAt level 317, the vampire cities no longer provided substantial experience gains. The unconquered cities housed direct descendants—at minimum, earl-class vampires whose danger level was astronomical. Meanwhile, he still lacked the strength to clear the Behen Archipelago and face the legends Pagma had transformed into death knights.\n\nStagnation loomed on all fronts. The East Continent represented his best option for continued growth.\n\n\"Take care, my Lord,\" Lauel said with a knowing smile.\n\nGrid paused at the doorway. \"You're absolutely sure you'll be fine without me?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\" Lauel's smile widened. \"Originally, things would've been precarious. But after you brought in Kasim, the situation has changed dramatically.\"\n\nIn truth, Lauel couldn't guarantee complete safety. But he refused to hold Grid back. A slight exaggeration now would lighten Grid's steps.\n\n\"Alright then.\" Relief washed over Grid's features. \"I need to say goodbye to Irene and—\"\n\nHe left the rest unspoken, already turning to leave. Lauel watched Grid's retreating back with barely contained excitement.\n\n*My Lord, I'll have a surprise ready for you soon.*\n\nIf Marquis Steim agreed to support Grid, Overgeared's forces could expand dramatically—and Grid would qualify for kingship. Imagine: Grid hunting on the East Continent, only to learn he'd become a king in his absence. Lauel could hardly wait to witness his lord's shock and delight.\n\n***\n\nBefore seeking out Sticks and departing for the East Continent, Grid had one more stop to make.\n\n\"Irene, I have a gift for you.\"\n\n\"Oh my...\" Irene's eyes lit up as she accepted the package. \"Dear husband, this is so thoughtful.\"\n\nThey'd retired to the bedroom, where Grid presented her with sleepwear—a white one-piece nightgown. A legendary-rated item, no less.\n\n> **[Direct Vampire's Pajamas]**\n\nThe item description mentioned an effect of \"revealing the skin when worn.\" Initially, Grid had questioned its usefulness.\n\n*There's a reason it's legendary-rated!*\n\nWhen Irene donned the garment, she became more alluring than he'd ever seen her. The Direct Vampire's Pajamas fully justified their legendary classification.\n\n\"Irene!\"\n\n\"Dear husband...\"\n\nGrid savored his wife's presence, her body more mature since Lord's birth, employing the dexterous techniques his legendary hands afforded him. Irene's soft sounds became a melody that sent shivers down his spine as Grid's large, skilled fingers traced patterns across her skin.\n\n***\n\n\"It's still too dangerous.\"\n\nGrid had collected minerals from the guild warehouse before visiting Sticks. The sage's response was immediate and negative.\n\n\"Most of the top-tier skills currently found on the West Continent originated from the East,\" Sticks explained. \"This alone tells us the overall level of the East Continent far exceeds our own.\"\n\nGrid already knew this. Sticks had previously mentioned that even Supreme Swordsmanship—the technique Piaro had mastered during his days as a great swordsman—had Eastern origins.\n\n\"The people of the East Continent developed stronger skills out of necessity,\" Sticks continued. \"The environment there is far harsher.\"\n\nSticks' logic was sound: the monsters inhabiting the East Continent vastly outclassed their Western counterparts. Rather than intimidate him, the prospect energized Grid.\n\n\"Fighting stronger opponents will make me stronger faster.\" Grid leaned forward. \"Sticks, I *need* to grow stronger quickly. Send me to the East Continent.\"\n\nHis primary motivation was simple—the people he valued most depended on his strength. Family, friends, colleagues. The secondary reason? Surpassing Kraugel. Grid dreamed of breaking every record Kraugel had set and claiming the number one spot for himself. As a gamer, the desire was only natural.\n\n\"No.\" Sticks shook his head firmly. \"It's wiser to continue growing in the vampire cities first. Aren't they still viable hunting grounds for you?\"\n\nAs one of the few candidates capable of cleansing and repairing the Contaminated Behen Archipelago, Grid was precious. Add to that the fact he'd saved Sticks' life and fathered Lord—Sticks' treasured disciple—and the sage's protectiveness was understandable. He wanted Grid to exercise better judgment, to avoid taking unacceptable risks.\n\n\"Those blessed or cursed by the gods...\" Sticks' expression grew somber. \"Grid, I know you have more than one life. But that doesn't mean you can completely overcome death.\"\n\nTrue enough. Players didn't face permanent death like NPCs, but the penalties were severe: experience loss, potential item drops, failed quests. Still, how could anyone play the game while paralyzed by fear of failure?\n\n*If I was that afraid of dying, I'd stick to single-player games with save points.*\n\nGrid met Sticks' gaze steadily. \"Sticks, would you only use addition because multiplication is hard to learn?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"No? Then it's time for me to face new challenges.\"\n\n\"...I'm convinced.\"\n\nThe example was crude, but it revealed Grid's fundamental nature. Perhaps Sticks had grown too cautious in his old age, his thinking too narrow. With a resigned sigh, he handed Grid a piece of parchment—an item Grid would normally need to purchase using points earned in the Behen Archipelago.\n\n> **[East Continent Movement Portal Scroll]**\n> \n> *Allows passage to the starting village of 'Pangea' on the East Continent.*\n> \n> **Weight:** 0.1\n\n\"Perfect.\" Grid's face split into a grin. Free items were always welcome!\n\n\"I'm off, then.\"\n\n*Flash!*\n\nGrid activated the scroll immediately, light swallowing him whole. Sticks lurched forward, startled.\n\n\"Wait—you should also take a return scroll for the West Continent...\"\n\nBut Grid had already vanished.\n\n***\n\n> [You have crossed the Dead Sea and arrived on the East Continent.]\n>\n> [You are the 31st player to reach this destination.]\n>\n> [The distance from the West Continent is too great. All forms of contact with West Continent players will be blocked.]\n>\n> [The ambient energy here is very dark. Mana regeneration rate increased by 10%.]\n>\n> [The gravity here is abnormally strong. **Strength** and **Agility** decreased by 10%. Health regeneration slowed.]\n>\n> [This is a forced environmental effect. It cannot be resisted.]\n\n\"Well, this heavily favors magician-type classes,\" Grid muttered, though he didn't particularly mind. Many of his skills consumed massive amounts of mana—the boost to regeneration would help.\n\n\"Still... 31st player, huh?\"\n\nOthers had clearly found their way here since the East Continent's discovery.\n\n\"Wait—what?\"\n\nGrid stood in Pangea, the East Continent's starting village, and his eyes widened as he took in his surroundings."
