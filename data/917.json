  "content": "**[Name: Singuled**\n**Age:** 39 **Gender:** Male\n**Race:** Human\n**Title:** Successor of a Half Killing Energy Method\n*When attacking, there is a 22% chance that the opponent can't resist the 'internal injury' state.\n*When dealing a counterattack, there is a 9% chance that the opponent can't resist the 'internal injury' state.\nThe enemy will suffer terrible pain, and all stats will fall dramatically. It is accompanied by bleeding (severe) and reduced resources recovery.\n**Title:** Knight of Destruction\n*Increases physical attack by 20% and attack power of wide area skills by 40%.

Singuled's stats were unlike anything he'd encountered—four thousand strength? Even accounting for the man's equipment, the raw numbers dwarfed most transcendents Grid had met. Character Observation had revealed plenty of powerful NPCs before, but this? This was something else entirely.\n\n*His build is completely lopsided. Most knights balance their attributes, but Singuled...*\n\nThe man had clearly sacrificed everything for raw killing power. That Killing Energy Destruction Method must demand overwhelming physical force to function properly—no wonder the skill had such a terrifying name. And those titles... each one stacked multiplicative damage bonuses that would make even boss monsters bleed out in seconds.\n\n*So this is why Mercedes ranked him above Asmophel.*\n\nGrid's mind raced through the combat implications. Frenzy and Killing Energy Destruction Method synergized perfectly—both grew exponentially stronger as Singuled's health dropped. Add in the blood-stealing properties, and the knight became a self-sustaining murder machine in prolonged battles. The only weakness was magic resistance, but Asmophel wielded a sword, not spells.\n\n*Besides Piaro, I can't think of many Red Knights who could take Singuled one-on-one.* Grid's lips curved upward. *Though any decent magician would tear him apart.*\n\nHe looked down at the man kneeling before him. Singuled's expression remained flat, his shoulders hunched with exhaustion rather than deference. This wasn't loyalty—this was a transaction. Still, Grid kept his voice warm and welcoming.\n\n\"Welcome to the Overgeared Kingdom. I know your situation.\" Grid extended his hand. \"I'll help you get your revenge, alongside Piaro and Asmophel. Until then, lend me your strength. Fight beside Piaro.\"\n\n\"...Yes.\"\n\nThe word came out hollow, devoid of conviction. Singuled didn't even meet his eyes.\n\nGrid held back a grimace. *Can't blame him. He's only here because he has nowhere else to go—revenge is all he's got left.* Pushing the issue now would only breed resentment. Building genuine loyalty would take time, careful cultivation of trust and shared purpose.\n\n*The sparring match will have to wait.* Requesting a duel right now might actually damage their fragile rapport. Grid needed Singuled stable and functional first, not bristling with hostility.\n\nHe leaned closer to Piaro, lowering his voice to barely a whisper. \"I need to understand more about killing energy—its nature, its cost. Find out what it'll take to reach Singuled's heart. Open him up.\"\n\nPiaro's eyes glinted with understanding. \"Consider it done, My Liege.\"\n\n***\n\n*We're bleeding talent to the Empire.*\n\nLauel slumped in his chair, fingers drumming against the armrest as his mind churned through recruitment statistics for the third time that week. Ever since committing himself to Grid's kingdom, he'd thrown everything into building their workforce—scouring the playerbase for skilled combatants, talented crafters, strategic thinkers. Anyone with potential.\n\nEven with transcendent NPCs like Piaro, Asmophel, and Mercedes bolstering their ranks, it wasn't enough. Lauel could see the chessboard taking shape across the continent: the Saharan Empire to the west, the Hwan Kingdom ruling the East Continent, and hell itself stirring below the surface. Each of those forces commanded resources and manpower that dwarfed the Overgeared Kingdom dozens of times over.\n\n*If we don't move fast, if we can't fracture the Empire before they consolidate power...*\n\nThe Overgeared Kingdom would be crushed. Simple as that.\n\nBut reality refused to cooperate with his plans.\n\n*Still nothing. Not a single prospect worth recruiting.*\n\nSince the kingdom's founding, Lauel had wielded his authority as Prime Minister like a weapon—dangling Grid Sets as incentives, offering tax exemptions, commissioning elaborate quest chains that hemorrhaged funds from the treasury. He'd deployed every tool at his disposal: benefits, temptations, opportunities for glory. The screening process had been rigorous, designed to filter out mediocrity.\n\nThe results? Disappointing.\n\n*Everyone worth recruiting is already with us.* The few talents who'd trickled in couldn't match the existing Overgeared members—not in skill, not in dedication, and certainly not in potential. It was like trying to build a castle with sand while watching his competitors quarry granite.\n\nLauel rubbed his temples. *I'm not even asking for geniuses anymore. Just competent specialists. People who can grow into their roles.*\n\nBut he knew why recruitment was failing. Understood it with perfect, frustrating clarity.\n\n*Backlash.*\n\nThe Overgeared Kingdom's meteoric rise had triggered a predictable reaction among the playerbase—especially among those who fancied themselves superior to Grid, who resented his success. These players actively avoided the kingdom, convinced they could forge their own paths to greatness without bending the knee to an \"item-carried\" upstart.\n\nAnd where did that pride lead them?\n\nStraight into the Empire's embrace.\n\nDozens of rankers—hundreds of skilled players just below that threshold—had already pledged themselves to Saharan. The Empire offered prestige, resources, and the comforting illusion of fighting for justice by \"keeping the Overgeared Kingdom in check.\" These fools actually believed they were doing something noble by opposing Grid.\n\n*Idiots.* Lauel's jaw clenched. *When will they realize their delusions of fairness are being exploited?*\n\nSatisfy operated like Earth in its freedom—an open world where two billion players could pursue their own stories, carve their own legends. That very openness made people oblivious to the larger narrative unfolding around them. Why should they care about the main storyline when it hadn't touched their gameplay yet?\n\nBut it would. Soon.\n\n*The Saharan Empire isn't just another faction.* Lauel leaned forward, his mind mapping out the future like a battlefield. *It's the lynchpin.*\n\nEvery single player on the West Continent—every quest, every starting village, every beginner's journey—existed under the Empire's shadow. And that shadow was growing. Emperor Juander dreamed of absolute conquest, of bringing every kingdom on the continent under his banner. The seventeen kingdoms lived in terror of that ambition.\n\nWar wasn't approaching. War was inevitable.\n\n*This is it. The first major story arc of Satisfy.*\n\nThe unification war would reshape everything. Two billion players would find their lives altered depending on which side prevailed—and most of them didn't even realize they had a stake in the outcome.\n\n*If the Empire succeeds...*\n\nThe thought made Lauel's stomach turn. Once the continent fell under imperial rule, the power dynamics would shift catastrophically. NPC nobility would consolidate their authority, and players—currently treated as valuable assets—would see their privileges stripped away piece by piece.\n\nDiscrimination wouldn't be subtle. The Empire's aristocracy operated with a fundamentally different worldview than modern players. Individual freedom, the ability to pursue personal goals without interference, the open access to opportunities—all of that would be curtailed. Restricted. Controlled.\n\n*Then they'll turn their eyes toward the East Continent.* And every player caught in the Empire's expansion would suffer for it, trapped in a system that prioritized NPC interests over their own.\n\nLauel had given this considerable thought. His conclusion remained unchanged: the West Continent needed a player as its ruler, not an NPC with archaic values and imperial ambitions. The Overgeared Kingdom had already proven the concept worked—most of their infrastructure existed specifically to benefit players, to maximize their potential and freedom.\n\nBut convincing people of that? Impossible, when the Empire painted Grid as the villain.\n\n\"...King Grid is too exceptional for his own good.\"\n\nLauel spoke to the empty office, his voice tinged with equal parts admiration and frustration. \n\nWasn't it absurd? Every time Grid went on an adventure, he returned with another legendary subordinate. Piaro. Asmophel. Mercedes. Sticks. Sua. The list kept growing, an ever-expanding roster of transcendents who pledged themselves to a man they'd known for weeks or months at most.\n\n\"Of course, I'm intelligent—strategically brilliant, even...\" Lauel caught himself spiraling and shook his head. \"But I lack whatever Grid has. That instinct for understanding what people need, for seeing their potential...\" \n\nHe glanced at his reflection in the darkened window.\n\n\"Is it Charisma? Am I too polished? Maybe people can't approach me because I'm too obviously competent. Too threatening.\"\n\nLauel deliberately twisted his face into an exaggerated expression of confusion, crossing his eyes and sticking out his tongue.\n\nThe office door swung open without warning.\n\n\"...What the hell are you doing? Is this some new American custom?\"\n\nLauel spun around, face flushing crimson. Grid stood in the doorway, one eyebrow raised in bewilderment—but Lauel's attention immediately locked onto the figure behind him.\n\nHis breath caught.\n\n\"This is—\"\n\n\"Don't you recognize him?\" Grid stepped aside, gesturing to his companion. \"Hurent. He joined the Overgeared Guild today.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe man looked rough around the edges—beard unkempt, hair greying at the temples, the weathered appearance of someone who'd been through hell. Lauel blinked several times, cross-referencing the face with his mental database of players. The ID flickered above the stranger's head, confirming what his eyes refused to believe.\n\nHurent. The Aura Master. America's golden child during the 1st National Competition, the rising star Lauel himself had identified as a legitimate threat. A monster-tier talent.\n\nStanding in his office.\n\nHaving just joined the Overgeared Guild.\n\n\"I figured you'd be thrilled.\" Grid frowned. \"Why are you just gaping at me?\"\n\n\"...\" Lauel's legs gave out. He collapsed into his chair like a puppet with cut strings. \"You're seriously just... picking people up off the street now?\"\n\n***\n\n\"Wait—you're skipping the National Competition?\"\n\nLauel shot upright, his previous exhaustion forgotten. This couldn't be right. Grid had dominated the last two Competitions, raking in benefits and prestige. The rewards alone justified participation—why would he voluntarily sit out?\n\n\"I don't understand. The Competition is a guaranteed windfall for you. If you're worried about the kingdom being vulnerable while you're away, I already told you—\" Lauel spread his hands. \"I've made thorough preparations this time. We won't get caught with our pants down like last year.\"\n\n\"I know you've got it covered. That's not why I'm sitting out.\"\n\n\"Hrmm.\" Lauel forced himself to calm down, to think rationally. Grid was the greediest player he'd ever met—the man collected benefits like a dragon hoarded gold. There had to be a reason. Some calculation Lauel wasn't seeing.\n\nThree potential gold medals, thrown away casually?\n\nNot without purpose.\n\nLauel exhaled slowly and shrugged. \"Fine. I trust you have a plan, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nGrid kept his expression carefully neutral, but internally he was dying to spill the truth—to boast about his secret role as the demon king, to explain the sheer entertainment value of terrorizing other rankers for three months. But the S.A. Group's contract had been explicit: absolute confidentiality regarding the demon king project. He'd signed the damn thing in triplicate.\n\nNo bragging rights. Not yet.\n\n\"Hrmm...\" Lauel studied Grid's face, searching for tells. Whatever he saw must have been reassuring, because his shoulders relaxed. \"Well, you're not one to accept losses lightly. I'll trust your judgment.\"\n\n\"Good. Focus on making sure the U.S. team capitalizes on my absence. You guys should be able to grab a championship this year, right?\"\n\n\"If you're not participating?\" Lauel's confidence returned immediately. \"The gold is already ours.\"\n\n\"That's some bold talk. What about Yura and Peak Sword? They're representing South Korea.\"\n\n\"They're certainly formidable. And there's Eat Spicy Jokbal, too.\" Lauel's smile turned sharp. \"But can those three match America's full roster?\"\n\n\"Mm...\" Grid's frown deepened as he mentally reviewed the U.S. representatives. The powerhouses available to Lauel were absurd—Kraugel alone could sweep multiple events, and Lauel himself was a strategic nightmare. Factor in all the other talented players, plus Hurent now...\n\n*I don't mean to disrespect Yura and Peak Sword, but...*\n\nThe matchup wasn't close. America fielded too many top-tier players.\n\n*And if Zibal participates too?*\n\nGrid felt a cold weight settle in his stomach.\n\nSouth Korea's roster suddenly looked dangerously thin.\n\n*The gap is massive.*\n\nGrid himself could reasonably guarantee two gold medals, maybe three. But Yura and Peak Sword? They were excellent, but...\n\n*If either of them draws Kraugel in the same event, they're done.*\n\nThe realization hit him like a hammer between the eyes.\n\n*What if South Korea's ranking tanks because I chose to play demon king for my own amusement?*\n\nThe backlash would be nuclear. Korean netizens didn't forgive easily—Grid had seen enough online witch-hunts to know how this would play out. The moment people learned he'd refused to represent his country for personal profit, they'd crucify him. He'd be branded a traitor, a sellout who prioritized individual gain over national pride.\n\n*Shit.*\n\nHe wasn't just a player anymore. He was a king. The ruler of the Overgeared Kingdom. If his reputation took a hit, so would the kingdom's prestige.\n\n*Do I need to back out of the demon king project?*\n\nThe thought stung, but Grid couldn't ignore the political ramifications—\n\n\"Your Majesty.\"\n\nLauel's voice cut through his spiraling thoughts. The man was watching him with unusual intensity.\n\n\"Do what you want. You can pursue whatever opportunities make sense to you.\" Lauel's expression softened. \"I asked you to become king because it benefited all of us—not to put a leash on you. Don't let fear of criticism dictate your choices. Do what feels right.\"\n\nGrid blinked, momentarily thrown by the earnestness in Lauel's tone.\n\n\"You...\"\n\nLauel could be insufferable—smug, condescending, too clever by half. But moments like this reminded Grid why he'd trusted the man with his kingdom's future. Behind all the posturing was genuine loyalty.\n\nGrid rose from his seat, a warm smile spreading across his face. \"I know you've been complaining about your eyes lately. Keep your expectations up—I should have something ready for you after the Competition ends.\"\n\n\"My eyes?\" Lauel touched his temple reflexively. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Sunglasses.\" Grid's grin widened. \"Special ones. The Evil Eyes' King could wear them without issue.\""
