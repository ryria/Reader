  "content": "[Do you wish to name this item 'Stone Sword'?]\n\n\"...Wait. No.\"\n\nGrid's hand hovered over the confirmation prompt. The name felt inadequate—insufficient for what they'd created. It wasn't the sighs from Kraugel or the assembled blacksmiths that stopped him. Rather, it was the armor currently weighing on his shoulders.\n\nKhan's posthumous masterpiece. Valhalla.\n\nGrid hadn't removed the armor since the old blacksmith's death.\n\n*The name matters. I need to consider this carefully.*\n\nWhy had Khan called it Valhalla? At first, Grid hadn't given it much thought—assumed it was simply copied from the legendary armor Khan's ancestor Albatino had forged. But later, he'd learned: one meaning of Valhalla was \"house of joy.\"\n\n*Through that name, I glimpsed Khan's heart.*\n\nKhan had hoped Grid would become like a great house—an entity capable of sheltering many people and bringing them happiness.\n\n*Yes. Names carry weight.*\n\nGrid's mind, which had been focused purely on the weapon's design and function, expanded. Lauel's advice echoed in his thoughts: \"Always think.\" If Khan had simply called his work \"Iron Armor,\" Grid wouldn't have felt what he felt now. He wouldn't have understood the weight a name could carry.\n\n*Besides...*\n\nThis was a collaboration with his friend. To give it such a careless name would be an insult.\n\n\"I'll change it.\"\n\nStone Sword.\n\nGrid's voice cut through the shocked silence of the blacksmiths.\n\n\"Muksabal.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"The sword's name will be Muksabal.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, earth's power symbolized defense—a guardian's strength. But Hero King Grid and Sword Saint Kraugel were monsters who could command the very ground beneath their enemies' feet. The earth they wielded would crush opponents under its terrible weight.\n\n\"That's why it's Muksabal.\"\n\n\"...Can you actually uproot the ground?\" Panmir forgot they were speaking metaphorically. The solemn atmosphere turned awkward, but Grid paid it no mind.\n\n\"Kraugel, I have no doubt that our combined knowledge, skills, and experience will devastate our enemies. Muksabal... I've given this name careful consideration. I hope you understand its meaning.\"\n\n\"...I do. There's no need for further explanation.\"\n\nThere were several points Kraugel could have challenged. But Grid looked so serious, so earnest, that refuting him felt wrong.\n\nStill.\n\n*I'll probably introduce it by a different name.*\n\nThat was all he could manage.\n\n***\n\n[Design: Muksabal]\n\nRating: Epic ~ Legendary\n\n**Epic Rating Information:**\nDurability: 455~790 / Attack Power: 390~650 / Defense: 100~188\n*Additional options unknown.\n\n**Unique Rating Information:**\nDurability: 667~980 / Attack Power: 493~817 / Defense: 140~246\n*Additional options unknown.\n\n**Legendary Rating Information:**\nDurability: ??? / Attack Power: ??? / Defense: ???\n*Additional options unknown.\n\n*A weapon design from Blacksmith Grid, who has transcended legend to approach myth, and Sword Saint Kraugel.*\n\n*The sword features a knuckle bow integrated into the handle to protect the wielder's hands. This knuckle bow is shaped like a miniature crown—both functional and elegant. The pommel extends laterally, creating the illusion of twin grips. This unique design enables unconventional attack patterns while providing defensive capabilities against enemy strikes.*\n\n*The blade is forged from either 10,000 Year Stone or Bloodstone, with performance varying dramatically based on material choice.*\n\n*The weight is substantial—those with insufficient strength cannot wield it effectively. However, its balance is flawless, making it an ideal weapon for capable warriors.*\n\nWeight: 6,800~13,900\nRequirements: Unknown\n\n*If I use 10,000 Year Stone, the minimum stats apply. With Bloodstone, the maximum. But the 10,000 Year Stone version will be significantly heavier.*\n\nGrid's face lit up as he reviewed the completed design. Though the exact options remained unclear, the base attributes alone were exceptional. An epic-rated one-handed sword guaranteed at least 390 attack power and 100 defense? Performance like that was rare even among level 300 equipment.\n\n*Plus, Muksabal's level requirement should be remarkably low.*\n\nKraugel's ideal was a \"wearable sword\"—Grid had designed around that philosophy. High versatility. Practical application. The materials made it heavy, yes, but anyone meeting the minimum strength requirement could handle Muksabal with ease.\n\n*The 10,000 Year Stone's cost means mass production will take time... I'll equip the knights first.*\n\nThis was a weapon leagues beyond the mass-produced Grid equipment. Even at unique rating, Muksabal's attack power surpassed many legendary weapons. The Overgeared Knights' combat effectiveness would skyrocket.\n\nDelighted, Grid turned to the most crucial task: production.\n\n\"Kraugel, give me the White Tiger's Breath.\"\n\n\"Here.\"\n\nA material obtainable only through completing hidden quests on the East Continent or winning National Competition gold medals. Kraugel handed over the white bead—worth an astronomical sum—without hesitation. Before the blast furnace where white phosphorus wood still burned, Grid recalled crafting the Red Phoenix Bow and the Enlightenment Sword.\n\n*The fundamental requirement for forging myth-rated weapons: strengthen the core materials.*\n\nWith the Red Phoenix Bow, he'd strengthened the Red Phoenix's Breath. With the Enlightenment Sword, Belial's Horn. In retrospect, those had been grueling ordeals. Minimum three days, sometimes a full week of hammering a single material. Demanding delicate technique throughout. Physically and mentally exhausting.\n\nThe greatest challenge had been the materials' *resistance*. The Red Phoenix's Breath unleashed scorching flames with each hammer strike. Belial's Horn exploded repeatedly. Without Grid's combination of high defense and stamina, strengthening either would have been impossible. A few hammer blows would have killed him.\n\n*The White Tiger's Breath will resist too.*\n\nSmelting could take over a week if it proved particularly temperamental.\n\n*This won't be easy.*\n\nThe thought of enduring that pain made him hesitate. Grid steadied his breathing, slowly relaxing his expression. Kraugel and Panmir misinterpreted his concern—they assumed he was nervous about the crafting result's rating. They never imagined he feared the act of creation itself.\n\nA natural misunderstanding. Every blacksmithing process they'd witnessed, heard about, or experienced had been ordinary. Most blacksmiths simply pressed a single \"production\" button. Even Panmir, who prided himself on handcrafting, relied heavily on system assistance. They couldn't fathom how much effort and time Grid invested into his work.\n\n\"Right. Let's begin.\"\n\nGrid moved decisively once prepared. He placed the White Tiger's Breath into the furnace. The temperature surged violently as the white bead heated.\n\n[Temperature exceeding safe limits!]\n\n\"Kuk...!\"\n\nPanmir watched Grid work and gasped. Grid aggressively exploited the white phosphorus wood's properties, driving the furnace temperature higher and higher. Panmir felt burns forming despite standing several meters away. Clutching his scorched forearm, he glanced around and realized—the other blacksmiths had already retreated. Even White, greatest of the four master craftsmen, maintained a safe distance.\n\n*Even master craftsmen can't endure that heat?*\n\nGrid generated such extreme temperatures instantly!\n\nAs Panmir gaped in amazement—\n\n*Puoook!*\n\n*Chik! Chiiiik!*\n\nGrid extracted the crimson-hot bead and plunged it into the quenching bucket. At least 100 liters of water began boiling like lava. Kraugel, who'd been standing beside Grid, dodged the erupting droplets with Super Sensitivity—an almost instinctive motion.\n\n\"Incredible! Truly worthy of a Sword Saint...!\"\n\nThe blacksmiths marveled at Kraugel's reflexes while Kraugel himself wondered:\n\n*Has item crafting always been this violent and dangerous?*\n\n*Teong!*\n\nGrid positioned the bead on his anvil. His expression remained grim—like a warrior entering battle. Kraugel couldn't help swallowing hard at the intensity radiating from him.\n\n*Ttaaang!*\n\nGrid's hammer descended.\n\nThe instant it struck the White Tiger's Breath—\n\n*Kwarururung!*\n\nThe bead roared. The ground shook violently. Sharp stone thorns erupted like a hedgehog's quills.\n\n\"Kuk...!\"\n\nGrid's cheeks, neck, and wrists were pierced. He couldn't completely evade the thorns bursting from the material.\n\n\"Grid...!\"\n\n\"Your Majesty!\"\n\nKraugel and the blacksmiths shouted in alarm. But none could intervene—this battlefield belonged to Grid alone. No one could assist without his permission. Grid wiped blood from his cheek and grinned.\n\n\"You bastard. High quality indeed.\"\n\nIts temperament was fiercer than the Red Phoenix's Breath and Belial's Horn combined. Why was this white tiger so vicious?\n\n*Fighting this twice consecutively is impossible.*\n\nGrid paused his hammering and retrieved his own White Tiger's Breath, immediately tossing it into the furnace alongside Kraugel's.\n\n*Better to fight once—with everything.*\n\nGrid intended to strengthen both materials simultaneously. The critical factor was time. He had to reach the Empire in two weeks—when Reinhardt's walls fell. The items needed completion before then.\n\n\"Kraugel, I need your help to smelt both at once.\"\n\n\"Tell me what to do.\"\n\n\"Keep me supplied with potions.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nMoments later—\n\n*Ttaaang!*\n\nGrid placed both White Tiger's Breaths side by side and resumed hammering.\n\nWith each strike, the materials unleashed volleys of stone thorns. Grid accumulated wounds but never stopped swinging. When injuries mounted, Kraugel administered potions to restore his health—all while dodging thorns erupting from every direction.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\n\"Kraugel! Potion!\"\n\n\"Drink. Left side. Dodge!\"\n\n\"Keuk! Missed that one!\"\n\n\"You can't evade attacks already in motion. Watch the material's movements—predict the trajectory!\"\n\n\"Understood!\"\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttaang~!*\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid hammered with ferocious concentration while Kraugel circled him, providing support. Panmir watched the spectacle of two legendary players working in perfect coordination and felt something profound.\n\n*Is this... really item crafting?*\n\nSteadily, inexorably—the two divine swords took form."
