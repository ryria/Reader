  "content": "**Stay composed.**\n\nAs ruler of hundreds of thousands, Grid carried responsibilities that extended beyond mere governance. Even children recognized and depended on him. His duty demanded dignity—not vanity, but the calculated projection of authority that would command respect from allies and strike fear into enemies.\n\nThe Overgeared Kingdom remained vulnerable. Potential threats surrounded them on all sides.\n\nGrid reasoned that an intimidating appearance would serve his purposes well. The decision to craft a sword stemmed not from any theatrical impulse—despite what Lauel and the evil eyes might inspire—but from pragmatic judgment.\n\nThere was, however, one complication.\n\nGrid possessed an aesthetic sense that could generously be described as \"below average.\"\n\n\"A magic sword...\" He sketched the design in his mind. \"Large red gem at the pommel, like a bloodshot eye. The crossguard shaped like bat wings spreading from either side. The blade itself—sharp angles, lightning-bolt design, really threatening...\"\n\nGrid nodded to himself, completely satisfied with this vision.\n\nKhan studied the insane dragon iron before them, then glanced at Grid with concern etched across his weathered features.\n\n\"To properly utilize insane dragon iron, we need equal quantities of insane dragon stone for suppression. But the iron proliferates infinitely while the stone remains finite.\" He paused. \"Your Majesty, in private moments like these... you need not stand on such ceremony with an old man.\"\n\n\"Standing beside you is honor enough. I respect you too deeply to presume the familiarity we once shared.\"\n\nGrid's expression softened with frustration. \"Why do you insist on this distance?\"\n\n\"Forgive me.\" Khan pressed on with his original point. \"The dragon nest resources won't last forever. Eventually, the insane dragon stone will be exhausted, and the iron will become unmanageable.\"\n\nGrid's shoulders sagged slightly. He'd already conducted experiments with the materials—suppressing the iron's growth required a precise ten-to-five ratio. The mathematics were inescapable. Someday, the iron would vastly outnumber the stone.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there's no alternative. When the stone runs out, I'll have to abandon the iron as a resource.\"\n\nKhan's eyes gleamed with sudden inspiration. \"What if you forged a hammer and anvil from the insane dragon stone itself?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Create tools that incorporate both the stone's suppression ability and the iron's proliferation. If the two properties exist in the same instrument—\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Understanding crashed over Grid like a wave.\n\nThis was the natural order of Satisfy. Players entered knowing nothing; NPCs guided them through the darkness. As players grew stronger, NPCs evolved alongside them, steadily imparting wisdom. Khan had earned the right to be heard, and his insight sparked a revelation.\n\nIf items crafted from insane dragon materials retained their inherent properties, then tools made from the stone might naturally counteract the iron's endless multiplication. The proliferation ability could be controlled.\n\n\"I'll test it immediately.\"\n\nThe insane dragon stone's low hardness presented challenges. To forge tools capable of tempering the iron, he needed to blend in harder minerals. Grid worked black iron into the insane dragon stone, his hands moving with practiced precision.\n\nThe result exceeded expectations.\n\n[You have succeeded in making the item.]\n\n[Black Insane Dragon Hammer]\n**Rating:** Epic  \n**Durability:** 410/410 **Attack Power:** 130\n\n*A hammer forged by the legendary blacksmith Grid, whose name grows closer to myth with each creation.*\n\n*Crafted from black iron, it possesses considerable durability. Most minerals can be tempered without difficulty.*\n\n*However, large quantities of insane dragon stone infused within grant it the 'Suppression' ability. This hammer will eliminate the unique characteristics of any mineral worked upon its surface. Do not use on minerals with desirable properties.*\n\n**Conditions of Use:** Advanced Blacksmithing Level 1  \n**Weight:** 400\n\n[Black Insane Dragon Anvil]\n**Rating:** Epic  \n**Durability:** 2,500/2,500\n\n*An anvil forged by the legendary blacksmith Grid, whose name grows closer to myth with each creation.*\n\n*Crafted from black iron, it possesses considerable durability. Strong enough to withstand continuous, violent friction.*\n\n*However, large quantities of insane dragon stone infused within grant it the 'Suppression' ability. This anvil will eliminate the unique characteristics of any mineral worked upon its surface. Do not use on minerals with desirable properties.*\n\n**Conditions of Use:** Advanced Blacksmithing Level 1  \n**Weight:** 6,900\n\n\"Perfect!\"\n\nKhan's hypothesis had proven correct. The suppression ability persisted even after transformation into tools. Grid grinned, already reaching for the insane dragon iron. His excitement died the moment he struck the first blow.\n\n[The Black Insane Dragon Hammer and Black Insane Dragon Anvil have failed to suppress the ability of the insane dragon iron.]\n\nThe smile fell from Grid's face.\n\nThe suppression effect proved too weak against pure insane dragon iron. The tools simply couldn't overpower the mineral's raw properties.\n\nKhan frowned, disappointment written clearly across his features. After a moment's contemplation, he spoke again.\n\n\"What if you incorporated the insane dragon bead?\" His voice grew more animated. \"The bead should amplify the stone's suppression effect. With enough power behind it, the tools could overcome the iron's proliferation.\"\n\nGrid stared at the old blacksmith. \"...You're a genius.\"\n\nThere were reasons Grid trusted Khan's judgment so completely. As a master craftsman, Khan possessed both talent and experience that complemented Grid's own abilities perfectly. The hypothesis felt sound.\n\nGrid seized one of the seven precious insane dragon beads and set to work creating a new hammer and anvil.\n\n[Insane Dragon Hammer]\n**Rating:** Unique  \n**Durability:** 630/630 **Attack Power:** 290\n\n*A hammer forged by the legendary blacksmith Grid, whose name grows closer to myth with each creation.*\n\n*Crafted from an insane dragon bead, it possesses exceptional durability. Any mineral can be tempered upon its surface.*\n\n*However, large quantities of insane dragon stone infused within grant it the 'Suppression' ability. The insane dragon bead amplifies this suppression to overwhelming levels.*\n\n*Once this hammer is used to smelt minerals, the unique characteristics of those minerals are unconditionally deleted. Do not use this hammer on minerals with desirable properties.*\n\n**Conditions of Use:** Advanced Blacksmithing Level 3  \n**Weight:** 600\n\n[Insane Dragon Anvil]\n**Rating:** Unique  \n*[Additional specifications omitted]*\n\nGrid's breath caught in his throat.\n\nKhan's theory had proven flawless. With trembling hands, Grid tested the new tools on insane dragon iron. The proliferation ability vanished completely under the hammer's strikes. With these instruments, he could work the eternally multiplying iron indefinitely.\n\n\"Yes! Incredible!\" Grid leaped into the air, unable to contain his joy.\n\nKhan, however, wore a troubled expression.\n\n\"One insane dragon bead was consumed to create these tools.\" His voice carried weight. \"Only seven complete Insane Dragon Hammer and Anvil sets can be produced.\"\n\nGrid landed, his elation deflating. \"Right. Seven beads total. Actually... six.\"\n\nHe'd already mentally allocated one bead for his magic sword.\n\nPerhaps the miners at the dragon nest would discover additional beads? Grid clung to that hope even as reality settled over him like a heavy cloak. These problems never resolved quickly.\n\nKhan offered what comfort he could. \"Don't trouble yourself over it now. Our workforce is already limited.\"\n\nThe old blacksmith was correct. Only twenty-six blacksmiths in the entire kingdom—Khan and Grid included—possessed the Advanced Blacksmithing skill required to wield the Insane Dragon tools. Setting aside Grid's personal projects and Rector's transfer to Reidan, that left twenty-four craftsmen. Even with unlimited tools, those twenty-four workers needed rest.\n\n\"The twenty-four will rotate through six hammer and anvil sets in continuous shifts.\"\n\n\"They'll need at least four hours of sleep per day. Any less and—\" Grid caught himself. \"Never mind. I trust your judgment on this, Khan. Just... watch your own health. And that Smith fellow—don't meet his eyes. He's a widower.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nAll the pieces had finally fallen into place. They possessed vast quantities of infinitely proliferating insane dragon iron. They had tools capable of controlling that proliferation. They had blacksmiths skilled enough to forge the Grid sets. Moving forward, the Overgeared Kingdom would focus all its industrial might on mass-producing equipment—the kingdom's ultimate weapon.\n\n—*Lauel, everything's ready. Time to release the quests.*\n\n—*Kukukuk...! At last, the moment arrives! Kuock, what is this trembling sensation? Could the black dragon sealed within my body be stirring?*\n\n—*...*\n\nGrid couldn't have imagined it then. The insane dragon iron possessed another application entirely—one far more revolutionary than anything he'd conceived.\n\n***\n\n[A kingdom quest 'For the Kingdom' has been created.]\n\n[For the Kingdom (1)]\nKingdom Quest.\n\nEliminate monsters or unauthorized organizations that threaten the security of the kingdom.\n\n**Quest Clear Reward:** Experience and gold.\n\n[For the Kingdom (2)]\nKingdom Quest.\n\nHunt monsters, dedicate a certain amount of resources or labor to the Overgeared Kingdom, or purchase goods exceeding a minimum threshold from kingdom stores.\n\n**Quest Clear Reward:** Experience and gold.\n\n[For the Kingdom (3)]\nKingdom Quest.\n\nListen to the people of Reinhardt and help them achieve greater prosperity.\n\n**Quest Clear Reward:** Mass-production Grid weapon.\n\n[The 'For the Kingdom' quest consists of 21 stages in total. There is no time limit and players may withdraw at any point.]\n\n[Grid's mass-production set items can be obtained through quest rewards. Players of sufficient ability may collect complete sets.]\n\nThe announcement reached all one hundred thousand players in the Overgeared Kingdom simultaneously. The quest difficulty, however, proved substantial. Monster levels and kingdom contribution requirements restricted participation to players at least level 180.\n\nOnly ten thousand of the hundred thousand qualified. Even the initial three stages presented serious challenges. Later stages promised exponential difficulty increases.\n\nYet there was no backlash. The quest system provided clear purpose to every Overgeared Kingdom player.\n\n*I must grow stronger. Strong enough to challenge these quests.*\n\nThe kingdom erupted with activity. Such was the power of items.\n\n***\n\n**COLUMN: Shin Youngwoo**\n\nThe recently implemented kingdom quest chain has become the hottest topic among Satisfy users. Twenty-one stages total, with mass-production Grid items awarded every three stages.\n\nThe \"Grid Set.\" The name carries the unfortunate modifier \"mass-production,\" yet no one questions its value. When else would ordinary users obtain equipment crafted by a legendary blacksmith? I imagine countless readers are already considering immigration to the Overgeared Kingdom for this opportunity alone. \n\nMore importantly, examine the quest content itself.\n\nCurrently, stages one through eight are public knowledge. Every single quest directly advances kingdom development. I'm confident this system will accelerate the Overgeared Kingdom's growth exponentially. They will achieve wealth that eclipses NPC-ruled kingdoms.\n\nGrid has revolutionized the game through items alone. Who could have predicted he would weaponize blacksmithing in this manner? I certainly didn't. Neither did you.\n\nRemember when Grid first appeared on the world stage? You laughed. Called him \"overgeared\" as an insult. You failed to comprehend the true power of equipment.\n\nGrid. Shin Youngwoo. An ordinary South Korean youth—no, a young man of below-average ability has become the center of our world.\n\nHe can be your future.\n\nDo you play virtual reality games? Then commit fully. Immerse yourself with reckless abandon.\n\nYou could be the second Shin Youngwoo. The second Grid."
