  "content": "**Hero King.**\n\nEven the name alone carried weight. From the description, Grid could tell it ranked alongside the First King title—another unique achievement.\n\n*Was all the suffering worth it?* He'd cleansed the entire Behen Archipelago, and now he held the proof.\n\nMost people expected hard work to be rewarded. But reality rarely delivered. Office workers slaved away for their companies, receiving little in return for their efforts. The world ran on this fundamental injustice, and most people were slaves to it.\n\nYet Satisfy operated differently. Players who invested time and energy into leveling up *did* see results. Quests yielded rewards. Progress came steadily to those who pursued it. And Grid stood at the forefront of that positive feedback loop.\n\nFighting energy swirled around him like a visible haze as he examined the title's full details.\n\n*At first glance, it's weaker than First King.*\n\nThe Hero King title granted additional damage against unique-rated classes and above, plus great demons, archangels, dragons, and demigods. Impressive targets, certainly—but also extremely rare. In practical terms, the title only functioned consistently through the resource called \"fighting energy.\"\n\nBy contrast, First King provided constant, overwhelming benefits.\n\nSo why did these two titles feel equivalent?\n\n*Because the surface never tells the whole story.*\n\nGrid studied the fighting energy mechanics more carefully.\n\n**[Fighting Energy]**\n*A special resource exclusive to the Hero King.*\n\nFor every point of fighting energy, his Strength, Stamina, and Agility increased by 0.5%.\n\n\"...That's massive.\"\n\nFighting energy remained at 10 points normally, rising to 100 during combat. Which meant Grid would *always* receive a 5% boost to three core stats—and during battle, that could spike to 50%.\n\n*It's almost broken.*\n\nEspecially for someone like Grid, whose stats already towered above average players. His current 3,500 Strength boosted by 50%? That reached 5,250—equivalent to gaining two hundred levels and dumping every point into Strength.\n\n*The penalty for dropping below 10 could be dangerous, though.*\n\nUnder normal circumstances, fighting energy sat at 10. Grid figured it would only fall lower if something went catastrophically wrong.\n\n\"Kukukuk...!\"\n\nLaughter escaped him as he grasped the Hero King title's true value. And this wasn't even the end of the Behen Archipelago's rewards.\n\n*There's still the statue buff and Madra's diary!*\n\nA stone monument to Grid now stood in the center of the Hall of Fame. In the future, he'd receive buffs from it. What kind of buffs? Excitement drove him forward.\n\nThen he stopped. His statue had been carved with exact, unflinching accuracy.\n\n\"...It's depressingly ugly.\"\n\nWhy did the most unsightly face in existence now decorate the Hall of Fame's centerpiece? The thought of two billion Satisfy users and countless NPCs pointing and laughing at his statue made him want to crawl into a hole. Sticks and Braham couldn't understand Grid's distress—objectively speaking, Grid's appearance was perfectly average for a human. But after the incident with Ahyoung, his self-esteem had never recovered.\n\n\"How do I even get the buffs?\"\n\nGrid sighed heavily and reached toward the statue.\n\n*Ttiring~*\n\nA cheerful system sound accompanied the information window.\n\n**[Statue of Hero King Grid Lv. 1]**\n\n*A monument commemorating the legendary blacksmith Grid, who granted rest to fallen legends and cleansed the contaminated Behen Archipelago.*\n\n**Worship Effect:** Dexterity +5%, higher-rated item creation probability slightly increased, sword-type attack skill speed +2%.\n\n* Every player or NPC who pays homage increases Statue's Worship by 1.\n* Every 5,000 Worship: statue level increases by 1, buff effects strengthen, occasionally new buffs unlock. Maximum level: 15.\n* Worship available once per three days. Buff duration: two days. Statue buffs do not stack.\n* Grid receives 10 days of buffs for every 1,000 Worship accumulated.\n\n**Current Statue's Worship: 0**\n\n\"...Wow.\"\n\nFive percent Dexterity, two percent sword skill speed, and improved crafting probability—all incredibly useful for Grid. And the ten-day buff window for every thousand worshippers? That was *extremely* attractive.\n\n*Could I maintain infinite uptime?*\n\nWith two billion Satisfy users, surely the worship count would climb fast enough to keep the buffs active permanently.\n\n*Thump-thump.*\n\nHis heart pounded. The statues weren't mere symbols—they provided tangible advantages beyond his wildest expectations. But one crucial question remained.\n\n\"Sticks, can people easily reach the Hall of Fame?\"\n\nIf players couldn't access this place, the statues meant nothing.\n\nSticks smiled. \"They can. The Behen Archipelago originally had entrances scattered across the continent. I sealed them after the contamination spread, but there's no need anymore. Many will visit the Hall of Fame now.\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nGoosebumps rose on Grid's arms as he imagined his worship count skyrocketing.\n\n\"Wait...\"\n\nThe phrase *'statue buffs do not stack'* caught his attention. Frowning, Grid approached the other legends' monuments.\n\n**[Statue of Sword Saint Muller Lv. 1]**\n\n*A monument commemorating Muller, the greatest Sword Saint in history, who sealed countless great demons and saved the world.*\n\n**Worship Effect:** Strength +7%, sword-type skill power +10%.\n\n* Every player or NPC who pays homage increases Statue's Worship by 1.\n* Every 5,000 Worship: statue level increases by 1, buff effects strengthen. Maximum level: 10.\n* Worship available once per three days. Buff duration: two days. Statue buffs do not stack.\n\n**Current Statue's Worship: 0**\n\n\"...\"\n\n**[Statue of Legendary Blacksmith Pagma Lv. 1]**\n\n*A monument commemorating the legendary blacksmith Pagma, who formed a contract with the 1st Great Demon Baal for humanity's sake.*\n\n**Worship Effect:** Dexterity +7%, higher-rated item creation probability slightly increased, sword-type skill speed +2%, undead summoning mana cost -3%.\n\n* Every player or NPC who pays homage increases Statue's Worship by 1...\n\n**Current Statue's Worship: 0**\n\n\"No, *dammit!*\"\n\nGrid cursed after confirming the other statues' buffs. His were objectively the worst. Anyone who didn't swear at this would be a saint.\n\n\"No one's going to worship my statue.\"\n\nHis dream of infinite buffs evaporated. The harsh truth set in—his monument would be nothing but a symbol. The worship counter would likely remain at zero for eternity.\n\n\"This is... I could cry... People will laugh at my statue every time they visit. It's ugly *and* useless.\"\n\nThere was no god in this world. Grid's frustration reached its peak.\n\nHe'd forgotten something important, though. Standing beside him was Lauel—more useful than any god.\n\n***\n\n\"Feeling better?\"\n\nAfter discovering the statue buffs, Grid had frozen for several minutes. His ugly monument stood in the Hall of Fame's center, offering inferior buffs. The thought of becoming a laughingstock shattered his mental state. He'd been so proud of earning a place here, and now he wanted to hide forever.\n\nBut the moment passed quickly. Grid carried too many responsibilities to wallow in self-pity.\n\n\"Yeah... I can't space out. I need to return to the kingdom.\"\n\nThe Overgeared Kingdom remained under pressure from the Saharan Empire. As king, Grid couldn't stay absent indefinitely.\n\n*I'll head back to the palace and check Madra's diary there.*\n\nIf even that turned out to be worthless, Grid didn't trust himself to handle the disappointment. Better to return home first and stabilize his emotions.\n\n\"Let's go back.\"\n\nGrid signaled to Sticks.\n\n\"Before that, visit the Field of Succession,\" Sticks replied.\n\n\"Field of Succession?\"\n\n\"Didn't I mention it? The Behen Archipelago serves two purposes—honoring past legends through the Hall of Fame, and passing down legacies to current legends.\"\n\n\"Ah...!\" The word *legacy* reignited Grid's hope. \"I might inherit something Pagma left behind?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Then let's go immediately.\"\n\n***\n\nThe Field of Succession occupied the sixty-fifth island.\n\n\"Only present legends may enter.\"\n\nGold covered everything. Nine elegant shrine-like buildings stood arranged in a circle, with Grid and Sticks at the center. Finding the correct structure proved simple—one bore a hammer and anvil engraved above its entrance.\n\n*Legendary Blacksmith's Succession.*\n\n*What did Pagma leave behind?*\n\nGrid's hands trembled slightly as he crossed the threshold.\n\n[**You have entered the Legendary Blacksmith's Succession as Pagma's Descendant.**]\n\n[**Welcome! Pagma's Rare Book (2) awaits you!**]\n\nThe cavernous interior stretched deep, flanked by dozens of stone pillars. At the far end rested a book identical to the one Grid had found in the North End Cave.\n\n\"Gulp.\"\n\nWhat secrets did it contain? Grid swallowed nervously, forcing his expectations down.\n\n*Anyone with a legendary class can enter this place.*\n\nThat meant the reward couldn't be anything extraordinary. Probably just a minor skill or passive. He repeated this to himself, preparing for disappointment. Grid took several mental breaths before reaching for Pagma's Rare Book.\n\n[**You have acquired Pagma's Descendant Hidden Piece: 'Granting an Ego.'**]\n\n**[Granting an Ego]**\n\n*Grant a target item an ego.*\n\nThe item will be classified as an ego item. Its value will become astronomical.\n\nUses increase by one each time Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship levels up.\n\n**Current Uses Available: 8/8**\n\n\"An ego item...!\"\n\nThis technique wasn't exclusive to dwarven smiths? Grid trembled with amazement at the new ability. The disappointment and loss from checking his statue's buffs had already been completely erased from his mind."
