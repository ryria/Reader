The commitment made their attacks predictable. Linear. When they missed, the opening was inevitable.\n\nYoshimura had fought enough paladins to understand this weakness. An archer with high agility should never struggle against such opponents. They were durable punching bags at worst. Threatening? Never.\n\nDamian shattered that assumption.\n\nSteel kissed flesh. Yoshimura staggered back.\n\n\"Kuak!\"\n\nAnother cut opened across his shoulder before he could recover. He couldn't evade. The blade found him every time, carving through his defenses like they were mist.\n\n\"You...\" Yoshimura's breath came in ragged gasps. \"How can a paladin use such refined swordsmanship? Did your hidden class change you into something else?\"\n\nThe archer's logic was flawed. Damian remained a paladin, even as Goddess' Agent. The unique rating of his class simply allowed him to transcend the limitations of ordinary paladins. He'd learned Advanced Sword Mastery where others could not.\n\nBut that wasn't the real secret.\n\nDamian stepped forward, blade tracking toward Yoshimura's guard. \"I'm a paladin. A paladin with the strongest master.\"\n\nThe words meant nothing to his opponent. They couldn't understand.\n\nDamian had farmed under Piaro's watchful eye. Those weeks of backbreaking labor had granted more than strong shoulders and dirt under his nails. Enlightenment had come between the rows of rainbow potatoes, delivered through Piaro's casual teachings.\n\n*Supreme Swordsmanship might be slower than other techniques*, Damian remembered the farmer saying. *Less varied. But it is the most excellent.*\n\n*Why?*\n\n*A good sword is controlled with strength. An excellent sword is controlled by mind and heart. It accelerates with your thoughts. It changes like your emotions.*\n\nAt the time, Damian hadn't grasped the meaning. If this were reality, Piaro's words would have been philosophical nonsense. But Satisfy translated intent into mechanics.\n\n> [You have received the teachings of the sword by Piaro and awakened!]\n\n> [**Accuracy** increases by 30% when wielding sword-type weapons. This effect is applied separately from Sword Mastery.]\n\nThe reward for completing that hidden quest had been extraordinary. Good behavior and diligence during training had earned Piaro's favor, and that favor had manifested as strength.\n\n\"The strongest teacher?\" Yoshimura shook his head. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"There's no need for you to know.\"\n\nDamian's blade punched through leather and flesh, sinking deep into Yoshimaru's side.\n\n\"Kuaaack!\"\n\nThe archer collapsed. Immediately, Orochi sprinted toward them with murder blazing in his eyes.\n\n\"How dare you do this to Master!\"\n\nThe Sakura Guild's strongest member. A twin sword specialist with a reputation for devastating PvP performance. His blade work could hypnotize opponents with its dazzling complexity.\n\nDamian met him with a shield. The impact of Orochi's dual strikes barely shifted his stance.\n\n\"Even Reidan's farmer who likes potatoes would yawn fighting you.\"\n\n*Reidan's farmer who likes potatoes?*\n\nOrochi's confusion lasted only a heartbeat. Was this the legendary farmer who'd crushed Hurent and two thousand soldiers in minutes? The stories had seemed exaggerated.\n\nMetal screamed. Damian shoved forward with his shield, using the momentum to drive his sword through Orochi's sternum.\n\n\"You aren't my opponent.\" The blade withdrew, slick with red. \"You'd need to be at least a temporary farmer to challenge me. And even I'm lacking compared to him.\"\n\n\"Temporary farmer?\" Orochi wheezed. \"Who is that?\"\n\n\"I also don't know.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThe battle became a massacre.\n\nThe Sakura Guild lacked anyone with a third advancement class. Against a Level 300+ Damian, they were outmatched in every metric that mattered. His base defense absorbed their attacks like a stone wall. His healing bordered on fraud. Killing him would require sustained focus from multiple high-level players.\n\nDamian's combat endurance was among the best on the continent. The two hundred girls traveling with him made things worse for his enemies. Rebecca's Daughters candidates moved with military precision, their support rotations leaving no openings.\n\n\"Shit! Shitt!\"\n\nDesperation crept into the Sakura members as their allies fell one by one.\n\nYoshimura's voice cracked. \"Why? Why are you helping a Korean?\"\n\nThe slur hung in the air like poison. Damian's expression hardened.\n\n\"An old-fashioned, racist remark.\" His blade found Yoshimura's throat. \"You should apologize.\"\n\n\"What? You... Keook!\"\n\nThe conversation ended. Damian had wasted enough words on people who deserved none. He killed the remaining Sakura Guild members in silence.\n\nThat day, the Sakura Guild suffered catastrophic losses. Every member died, losing experience and items in the process. The damage would cripple their operations for weeks.\n\n***\n\nGrid understood something fundamental after sparring with Kraugel.\n\nBecoming the best wasn't a fantasy.\n\n*Geniuses.* He stood in Reidan's smithy, staring at the cold forge. *No, it's true that my talent is garbage compared to the general public.*\n\nHe didn't flinch from the admission. He'd lived with that reality since childhood. Denying it would be delusional.\n\n*But.*\n\nHis hand closed around Failure's hilt.\n\nGrid possessed a weapon no one else had. The power of items. Not ordinary equipment, but legendary-rated masterpieces that had brought the Sky above the Sky to his knees.\n\n*First, I need to polish my weapons.*\n\nOther users obtained items through raids and grinding. Grid made his own. As Pagma's Descendant, he could craft ideal equipment from raw materials.\n\n*But it isn't easy.*\n\nThere were limits. He couldn't forge a weapon dealing ten billion damage, or armor with ten billion defense. The system had guardrails. Balance restrictions.\n\n*It's about creating ideal items within those limits.*\n\nThat realization led to another. He couldn't do it by hiding in the smithy. Experience had taught him that lesson already.\n\nSo what did he need?\n\nGrid stood motionless in the forge, his mind working through the problem.\n\n\"Expand my insights.\"\n\nEven Kraugel, with all his genius, hadn't grown strong in isolation. The Sky above the Sky had grown through repeated adventures. Meeting new people, fighting new enemies, learning and evolving through conflict.\n\n*I should do the same.*\n\nThe decision crystallized. Grid knew exactly where to go.\n\n*The Behen Archipelago.*\n\nSixty-six islands. Even Kraugel had only reached the thirtieth. By challenging the archipelago, by experiencing its trials, Grid could overcome his shortcomings. He could design more ideal items. He could grow.\n\nGrid left the smithy and headed for the castle.\n\n***\n\n\"Abu! Abuuuu!\"\n\nLord's excited babbling echoed through the hall as Grid entered. Irene stood beside their son, her expression radiant. Both turned to welcome him home.\n\nIrene's gaze held warmth. Lord's eyes burned with something that looked almost like envy.\n\n*I want to make them happy for the rest of their lives.*\n\nSatisfy wasn't reality. Enemies lurked everywhere. His precious family could be threatened at any moment. To protect them completely, Grid needed to become stronger.\n\nHe sent a whisper to Lauel.\n\nMinutes later, the Earl appeared, looking haggard. Papers had been sticking to his sleeve when he'd materialized in the hallway, and he smelled faintly of ink.\n\n\"Did you call?\"\n\nLauel's office must have been a disaster. Grid felt a pang of guilt for his constant reliance on the strategist's brilliance.\n\n\"I'm incompetent.\" Grid met his friend's eyes. \"You're carrying everything while I...\"\n\n\"I wanted to do it.\" Lauel waved off the concern. \"You don't have to worry. Continue to rely on me.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Grid nodded. \"I will. That's why I need you to handle things while I'm gone.\"\n\n\"...Huh?\"\n\n\"I'm planning to visit the Behen Archipelago. Please look after Reidan and my family while I'm not here.\" He paused. \"Ah, can I also take some potions from the alchemy facility?\"\n\n\"Huh? Ah, yes. Of course.\"\n\nLauel looked confused, but he didn't question the decision. After the Kraugel incident, Grid had become more cautious. More deliberate. Lauel trusted that caution implicitly.\n\nThat night, Grid made love to Irene with desperate tenderness. In the morning, he said goodbye to Lord, ruffling the baby's dark hair before leaving for the Media Kingdom.\n\n\"Aba! Abubu! Abu!\"\n\nLord gripped his <span class=\"rarity-rare\">Baby's Wooden Sword</span> in both tiny hands, crying out as his father's silhouette shrank in the distance. The adults smiled at the baby's farewell.\n\nNone of them understood his words.\n\nA few days later, Pope Damian's procession finally crossed the desert and reached Reidan. His heart felt fit to burst. After so long, he'd finally see Grid and Piaro again. Two people who'd helped him without ever mocking his otaku tendencies.\n\nThe touching reunion never happened.\n\n\"A murderer like you can't enter the city!\"\n\nThe guards at Reidan's gates blocked his path with crossed spears. Their hostility was justified. Damian's name glowed bright red from the Sakura Guild massacre.\n\n\"No, I'm the Pope.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Why would the Pope commit such butchery?\"\n\n\"A murderer trying to lie! Disgraceful! Get out now!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nEventually Lauel intervened, allowing Damian entry. But by then, Grid had already departed.\n\n***\n\nCountless players dreamed of reaching the East Continent.\n\nSome wanted to claim first mover advantage. Others hoped for a reversal of fortune in virgin territory. Every type of player attempted the crossing. The wealthy poured astronomical sums into the effort.\n\nMost failed. The Dead Sea swallowed their ambitions.\n\nOut of two billion users, fewer than one thousand had discovered the method. They'd cleared linked quest chains, grasping the existence of Sage Sticks through perseverance and luck.\n\nOf those thousand, fewer than ten had actually crossed to the East Continent.\n\nThe Behen Archipelago stood between them and success. Sixty-six islands functioning as an instant dungeon, each more brutal than the last.\n\n\"Sigh.\"\n\nGrid reached the archipelago after a long journey. He stood at the beginning of the bridge connecting the mainland to the first island, drawing a deep breath.\n\nWas he nervous? Kraugel had warned that even famous high rankers had been eliminated at the first island.\n\nNo. Grid brimmed with confidence. The deep breathing was to control his temper, not fear. He needed to stay calm.\n\n\"Now then. Shall we get started?\"\n\nGrid stepped onto the bridge. At its end, a notification appeared.\n\n> [Do you want to enter the instant dungeon 'Behen Archipelago'?]\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n> [The 'Behen Archipelago' is limited to one person and the escape method is unknown. Death is highly likely. Do you still want to enter?]\n\n\"Go.\"\n\nThe gate swallowed him whole.\n\n***\n\n\"It's been a long time since there was a challenger.\"\n\nSticks gazed into his scrying orb. The hidden sage's expression remained neutral as he observed the black-haired man materializing on the first island.\n\nHe examined the challenger closely. Nothing about the man inspired confidence.\n\n\"He'll be eliminated anyway.\"\n\nThe first island drained stamina to the absolute limit. Faced with that terrible constraint, challengers self-destructed. Over the past few decades, most had died on the first island without ever seeing the second.\n\nSticks expected the same outcome for this black-haired man.\n\nReality defied his expectations.\n\n\"Heok! N-No, how...?\"\n\nSticks recoiled as if he'd seen a ghost. His shock was justified.\n\nThe first island's objective was straightforward. Survive for twenty minutes against an infinite wave of monsters. Most challengers used terrain advantages, retreating to high ground or narrow chokepoints to limit attack vectors. Even knowing the strategy, most didn't survive the full duration. Stamina failed them.\n\nThis black-haired man used no strategy at all.\n\nFour golden hands materialized around him, each gripping a different weapon. Grid simply stood his ground and waited. As monsters spawned, the **God Hands** slaughtered them with mechanical efficiency.\n\nIt destroyed conventional wisdom. Even the sage found himself speechless.\n\n***"
