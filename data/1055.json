Publishers are already compiling his achievements into books...*\n\n**[IMMIGRATION SURGE] The Korean Dream**\n*Applications for South Korean residency have skyrocketed. Many cite the Overgeared members who relocated as their inspiration...*\n\nEvery channel. Every newspaper. Youngwoo and Sehee's names blazed across headlines worldwide.\n\nAt home, their parents couldn't stop grinning.\n\n\"Did you see this article?\" Youngwoo's mother waved a magazine. \"We need to preserve these! Frame them!\"\n\n\"Already done.\" His father's chest puffed with pride. \"Bought twenty magazines. Well worth it.\"\n\n\"Twenty? Only twenty?\" She fixed him with a stern look. \"We should have a hundred—gifts for friends and relatives, keepsakes for grandchildren! How can Grid's father be so stingy?\"\n\n\"I...\" He cleared his throat sheepishly. \"I actually ordered two hundred. They sold out. Backordered them all when the next printing runs.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Her expression melted. \"You really are bold. The father of such accomplished children.\"\n\n\"And you're as wise as they are brilliant. Marrying you was the best decision of my life.\"\n\n\"Dear...\"\n\n\"Honey...\"\n\nThe air grew thick with affection.\n\nSehee smiled, watching her parents drift toward their bedroom. *They're going to make us a sibling at this rate.*\n\nShe remembered the darker days—when her brother drifted, and their parents blamed themselves for doubting him. They'd thrown themselves into work, determined not to burden their son. Their skin had tanned from endless hours under the sun. They'd seemed to age overnight.\n\nBut Sehee knew better. They were healthier than ever. Pride in their son transformed grueling labor into joyful exercise. When Youngwoo proved too busy, they donated and volunteered in his name. Each day, they grew happier. Stronger.\n\n*All because of my brother.*\n\nSehee's chest tightened with admiration. *I want to be like him.*\n\nKorea had produced greats before—legendary comedians, athletes, artists. But those were rare. Once-in-a-generation phenomena. And never a gamer. Five years after Satisfy's launch, one player had changed the world's entire perception of gaming.\n\n*The game... honor... my parents... success through gaming...*\n\nHer thoughts churned. Her generation had been raised on a single mantra: *Education is the path to success.* But now? With Satisfy dominating the world, was studying the only answer?\n\nHer brother proved otherwise.\n\nThe life she'd always imagined—a stable job, wealth enough to support her family—could be achieved through Satisfy. After serious contemplation, Sehee made her decision.\n\nShe tapped her smartwatch, fingers dancing across the holographic keyboard. The message went to her best friend Yerim:\n\n*Should we take a leave of absence from school? Level up instead?*\n\nThe reply came instantly:\n\n*ㅇㅅㅇ/ YES.*\n\n\"...\"\n\nHad Sehee been the only one hesitating? Was she inflexible? *Is that why I don't like Jishuka—because she's too open?*\n\nAnother message arrived:\n\n*Let's get those older women away from your brother! >_<*\n\nSehee knew exactly who Yerim meant. Yura, who'd confessed publicly. Jishuka, who'd moved next door and launched a daily campaign of seduction. Yerim's territorial instincts were on high alert.\n\nSehee sighed. She loved Yerim dearly, but as a sister-in-law? *Brother would suffer too much.*\n\n*Oh, running late today. New boyfriend. Date night! ★*\n\nSehee stared at the screen. *Three boyfriends this month. Three.*\n\nYerim was wonderful—free-spirited, passionate, alive. But her brother needed stability.\n\nMental note: *Yerim—eliminated.*\n\n***\n\nIn Reinhardt, capital of the Overgeared Kingdom, Grid finally allowed himself to rest.\n\nHe strolled through gardens with Irene and Lord. Shared meals. Drank tea on sun-dappled terraces. Simple pleasures he'd denied himself for too long. Irene was older than him now in years, yet remained achingly beautiful—would remain beautiful all her life.\n\n*This is what matters.*\n\nMaybe he should retire. Spend his days like this forever. The thought surfaced as he watched Irene's delighted smile, and guilt stabbed through him. *I'm never here for her.*\n\nHer pale fingers poked his cheek. \"Don't think like that. No matter where you are, I feel you. I'm never lonely.\"\n\n\"Irene...\"\n\nShe read him so effortlessly. A woman who always put him first. Her presence was a blessing he'd never deserved. Grid pulled her into his arms.\n\nIrene laughed softly against his chest. \"Besides, what's that old saying? As long as a husband earns well, it's fine if he's rarely home...\"\n\n\"What?\" Grid jerked back. \"Who told you that?\"\n\nPure innocence shone in her smile. \"Yerim.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"I listened to her advice and observed other wives. The ones whose husbands are home constantly? They quarrel. Isn't that sadder? A little distance between couples seems healthy.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Yerim corrupted my pure wife.*\n\nGrid wanted to cry. But he recognized the thoughtfulness behind Irene's words—she was trying to ease his guilt.\n\n\"When things settle with the Empire,\" he said softly, \"let's take a trip. Just us. That beautiful coastline you love.\"\n\n\"I can't wait.\" Irene kissed his cheek, her heart overflowing. Her husband—a commoner who'd become a noble, founded a kingdom, and now sought friendship with the Empire itself. How blessed she was to have met him. She offered silent gratitude to every god who'd guided their paths together.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nLord watched his parents embrace from a respectful distance, giggling quietly. The young prince had learned a vital lesson from their example: love was the most beautiful connection in existence.\n\nHe turned and kissed one of the Rebecca's Daughters standing beside him. As he did every day.\n\nCoke, his sworn knight, shook his head. *His lips never chap despite doing that constantly.*\n\nHonestly, Coke envied the prince's harem. But he also saw the strategic value. If Grid's grandchildren numbered in the dozens—or hundreds—the kingdom's future was unshakeable.\n\n*One or two hundred third-generation Grids...*\n\nThe future looked overwhelming in the best possible way.\n\n***\n\nLate that night, a cool breeze stirred the palace terraces.\n\nGrid stepped outside after ensuring Irene slept soundly. He addressed the empty darkness: \"Well?\"\n\nA voice answered from nothing. \"We can't build friendship through one-sided gestures. When the Overgeared Kingdom and the Empire establish formal relations, I'll come forward for treatment.\"\n\n\"Stubborn bastard.\"\n\nDuring the return journey, Grid had remembered his promise to heal Grenhal's wounds. In his excitement over the successful raid, he'd forgotten entirely. He'd sent Faker to bring Grenhal to him immediately.\n\nThis was the duke's response. He'd wait for a better future—when politics aligned with personal need. Inflexible, perhaps. But trustworthy.\n\n*I really was lucky.*\n\nGrenhal. Morse. Basara. Gaining relationships with those three dukes was fortune beyond measure. And it had all started with listening to Lauel—prioritizing the Ruins of the War God over other concerns.\n\n*Following Lauel's advice is like getting bread while I sleep.*\n\nGrid smiled and returned to bed.\n\n***\n\nSimultaneously, in Titan, capital of the Saharan Empire...\n\n*His Majesty left the palace personally? That's unusual.*\n\nDuke Grenhal had returned from the Berith raid and requested an imperial audience, only to be told to wait ten days. The Emperor had departed on urgent business. Quite irregular. Grenhal felt both puzzled and pleased—at least the Emperor was handling state affairs actively. He'd retired to his Titan villa to wait.\n\nThen the riders appeared. Magic machines surrounded his estate.\n\n\"Duke Grenhal.\" Fourth Prince Edan's voice was cold. \"I'm placing you under arrest for treason.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you'd care to elaborate on these charges?\"\n\n\"We'll discuss details in prison.\"\n\n\"An imperial prince lacks authority to detain a duke.\"\n\n\"I lack authority.\" Edan's smile was razor-thin. \"But I have strength.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe prince had committed fully. Grenhal stepped back warily. The magic machines he'd witnessed in the canyon exceeded his expectations—caution was vital. But Edan pressed forward.\n\n\"Take this seriously.\" Edan signaled the riders. Their magic machines flared with multicolored light.\n\nGrenhal's berserker power erupted in response."
