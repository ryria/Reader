Thud.*\n\n*Any moment now...*\n\nBland worked the field with methodical precision, his sun-bronzed skin glistening with sweat. Dirt streaked his face and hands, but his aristocratic features remained unmistakable beneath the grime. He drove the plow deeper, muscles coiled with anticipation.\n\n*Just a little longer.*\n\n*Thud. Thud. Thud.*\n\nThen it came. The call he'd been waiting for.\n\n\"Snack time!\"\n\nBland's head snapped up. His pupils dilated.\n\nHe vaulted to his feet and thrust both hands forward. \"Haste!\"\n\nGreen light flared around his body. The spell seized his muscles and accelerated every movement. His speed doubled instantly. A performance only a hundred mages on the continent could achieve.\n\nBland shot across the field like an arrow released from a drawn bow.\n\n\"That bastard!\"\n\n\"He's going for all the potatoes again!\"\n\nThe other farmers scrambled after him, feet churning through the dirt. But they had no chance. Bland's magical enhancement left them eating his dust.\n\n\"You know Piaro said to share!\"\n\n\"I'm telling Piaro!\"\n\nThe childish threat made Bland falter for half a step.\n\n*But I need to eat.*\n\nHe was the son of Earl Ashur, one of the Ten Great Magicians. In his former life, potatoes had been pig feed. Beneath his notice. He'd dined on delicacies prepared by master chefs, ingredients sourced from across the kingdom.\n\nCaptivity in Reidan had changed everything.\n\nOut of desperation, he'd eaten his first potato. The explosion of flavor had shocked him. Seven distinct tastes from a single Rainbow Potato. Sweetness, saltiness, umami, tang, heat, bitterness, and something indefinable. Each bite brought instant satiation and a strange sense of peace.\n\nReidan's markets now overflowed with provisions, but nothing compared to those damned potatoes. They'd become sacred to him. More comforting than any god's blessing.\n\n***\n\n\"Another one today?\"\n\nThe housewives looked up as Bland skidded to a halt before them, chest heaving. He nodded without hesitation.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Oh, you poor thing...\"\n\nThe women exchanged pitying glances. This beautiful young man from a noble house, reduced to slave labor under Duke Grid's iron fist. They'd heard the rumors. Every day in the fields, then dragged away by that monster Piaro for brutal \"special training.\"\n\n*He eats to cope with the stress.*\n\n*Such a handsome boy, suffering like this.*\n\nOne of the housewives dabbed at her eyes and pressed a cloth bundle into Bland's hands. Ten baked potatoes. Ten boiled.\n\n\"You know it's supposed to be one per person...\"\n\n\"But we know what you're going through. Take all of these.\"\n\n\"Eat up and stay strong!\"\n\nBland accepted the bundle with a slight frown. His sheltered upbringing as the kingdom's elite had left him with little exposure to commoners. Sixteen months in Reidan had slowly shifted his perspective.\n\n*They have so little, yet they give so freely.*\n\nThe generosity embarrassed him, though he'd never admit it.\n\n\"No need for concern.\" He clutched the bundle to his chest. \"My bloodline grants me exceptional constitution. I won't fall ill. Save your sympathy.\"\n\nHis tone came out haughty and dismissive, but the housewives just smiled. The way he cradled those potatoes like treasure told the real story.\n\n\"I mean, it's still just pig food.\" Bland sniffed and turned on his heel. \"But I suppose I'll eat it anyway.\"\n\nThe farmers arrived moments later, red-faced and panting.\n\n\"He took the whole batch!\"\n\n\"Some of us won't get any!\"\n\n\"Damn him!\"\n\n*Undignified fools.*\n\nBland clicked his tongue and strode toward the north wall, seeking solitude. He settled onto the ground and unwrapped the cloth. The first potato was halfway to his mouth when his eyes narrowed.\n\n*Rats.*\n\nTwenty figures clung to Reidan's outer wall. They moved with calculated precision, ascending in near-perfect silence. Their clothing matched the stonework's color with uncanny accuracy.\n\nThe old Bland would never have spotted them.\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\nAsmophel had marched out with the army half a day ago. These infiltrators had chosen their timing well.\n\n*Not my problem.*\n\nWhether they succeeded in breaching Reidan's defenses made no difference to him. Let them slaughter whoever they wanted. Burn the city to ashes. From his position, he should be cheering them on.\n\n\"So why...?\"\n\nWhy did anger simmer in his gut? Bland bit into a boiled potato and stood. The delicious food. The farmers who'd become his unwilling comrades. The housewives who showed him kindness despite everything.\n\nThey might be harmed.\n\n*I don't like this feeling.*\n\nMore than anything else.\n\n\"...Irene.\"\n\nThe woman he'd once loved lived within those walls. He held no illusions anymore. She belonged to another man now.\n\n*But I want her to be happy.*\n\nBy the third potato, his mind was made up.\n\n\"Fire Arrow.\"\n\n*Whoooom!*\n\nEight arrows of flame erupted from his outstretched hand. They streaked toward the twenty assassins with far greater power than any standard Fire Arrow should possess. Sixteen months of training under Piaro had fundamentally changed him. The fieldwork had taught him to tap into the earth's natural mana.\n\nSimilar to Piaro's legendary Natural State.\n\n***\n\nDaluka. An assassin shrouded in mystery and legend. Rumors claimed both Doran and Kasim had learned at Daluka's feet. Ten years ago, the Eternal Kingdom had stumbled upon one of Daluka's hidden techniques through sheer fortune.\n\nThe Silver Dragons were born from that discovery.\n\nFive thousand orphans had been gathered from across the kingdom. Five thousand subjected to brutal training. Of those, only forty survived to learn the technique. And not one had truly mastered it. They'd merely scratched the surface.\n\nBut even that proved devastating.\n\nIn their first year of operations, the Silver Dragons maintained a perfect success rate. Prince Ren saw the future clearly. With this force at his command, the Eternal Kingdom would rise. One day, they would challenge even the Saharan Empire itself.\n\nThe silver dragon on their standard would spread its wings once more.\n\n*What's happening?*\n\nThe twenty Silver Dragons pressed flat against the ground, confusion rippling through their ranks. Agricultural fields sprawled in all directions from Reidan's outer walls. They'd anticipated crossing empty farmland.\n\nInstead, dozens of farmers worked the soil.\n\n*Why are they moving like that?*\n\nThe farmers' motions caught the assassins' attention. The way they swung their sickles and wielded their plows resembled sword techniques. Several radiated the presence of master warriors. The kind who could represent entire kingdoms.\n\n*This doesn't make sense.*\n\nThe Silver Dragons had learned the Absence of Worldly Desires. A breathing technique that suppressed all emotion, all agitation. The twenty agents on this mission had reached the fifth stage. They could face death itself without flinching.\n\nYet these farmers unsettled them.\n\n*Move more carefully.*\n\nThey adjusted their approach and dropped to their bellies. Crawling through the dirt. Avoiding the farmers' sight lines at all costs.\n\n*Panting... so filthy.*\n\nBy the time they reached the outer wall, they'd burned precious time and stamina. They should have already secured the duchess. Instead, they hadn't even breached the perimeter.\n\nUnacceptable.\n\n*Steady yourself.*\n\nThe fifth stage Absence of Worldly Desires reasserted control. Their emotions flattened. They activated Daluka's Clothes, a chameleon-like technique that achieved perfect camouflage.\n\n*Scrape. Scrape.*\n\n*Scrape scrape scrape.*\n\nEven the gods couldn't see them now.\n\nThen fire arrows slammed into their backs.\n\n\"Gah!\"\n\nHow? The Silver Dragons twisted mid-climb, evading the magic through pure reflex. Their eyes locked onto the source.\n\nA farmer. Eating potatoes. Sun-darkened skin. Completely unremarkable.\n\n*He cast that?*\n\nThe magic had been too fast, too powerful to dodge completely.\n\n*These farmers are insane!*\n\nTheir fifth stage discipline cracked. Doubt seeped through.\n\n*Abort and continue the mission?*\n\n*No. Witnesses must be eliminated. Always.*\n\nThey dropped from the wall as one, converging on the potato-eating farmer. A mage's defenses were laughably weak. Easy prey.\n\nHis bombardment? Irrelevant. They wouldn't give him time to cast another spell.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nTheir confidence shattered.\n\nThe farmer conjured a shimmering shield. Drew a sword from his belt. Fired another spell while maintaining both shield and blade.\n\n*What is he?*\n\nFarmer. Mage. Swordsman. The roles blurred together.\n\nBland unleashed Fire Blast at the descending assassins. Casting while shielding. While armed.\n\n\"Double casting!\"\n\nThe Silver Dragons' faces went white. Their fifth stage Absence of Worldly Desires collapsed entirely.\n\n***\n\nElsewhere.\n\n\"Throw it again.\"\n\nKasim, the King of Shadows, sat cross-legged on the floor. The legendary assassin who'd ended countless lives now devoted his full attention to a drooling infant.\n\n\"Abu! Abuuuu!\"\n\nLord glared at the target with his father's sharp eyes. The baby's expression seemed to say: *I'll get it this time.*\n\nHe hurled the wooden block.\n\n*Thwack!*\n\nThe block struck a doll three meters away. The doll toppled.\n\nTwo days of practice had led to this moment. The progress exceeded all of Kasim's projections.\n\n*This child...*\n\nAdmiration swelled in the assassin's chest.\n\n*He'll master every technique the Master knows.*\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms**  \n**OG:** Glossary Link  \n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week\n\n**Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
