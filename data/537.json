Players coveted the silver thread harvested from armored needles, calling the dungeon a treasure trove—a land of opportunity that everyone wanted to access.\n\nPangea's knights and soldiers found this exasperating.\n\nA treasure trove? A land of opportunity? Madness, all of it. The castle dungeon was *hell*—the worst place on earth, crawling with powerful and vicious monsters.\n\nDay after day, knights and soldiers risked their lives on expeditions to prevent the dungeon's inhabitants from spilling into Pangea proper. Now fortune-seekers demanded entrance. Volunteers with no combat ability were nothing but liabilities. Case in point: these blacksmiths.\n\n*Shameless,* the knights thought as Grid and White arrived with Han Seokbong.\n\nThe blacksmiths who'd won this year's competition drew hostile stares. How dare they approach so casually while warriors shed blood below? The atmosphere grew frigid until Han Seokbong's daughter stepped forward.\n\n\"Father.\"\n\n\"Ah, Sua.\"\n\nSua could easily claim the title of Pangea's greatest beauty. More than that, she possessed grace, intelligence, and exceptional martial prowess. Han Seokbong never tired of boasting about her—particularly her role as captain of the Red Phoenix Group, the elite dungeon exploration team.\n\nHer black hair swept up with an ornate hairpin, her elegant robes flowing as she moved—she resembled nobility incarnate.\n\n*Beautiful.*\n\nGrid found himself staring. Unusual, for him.\n\nAfter all, Grid had married Irene, one of the continent's most stunning women. He regularly interacted with Jishuka and Yura, both breathtaking in their own right. He even had a lovely younger sister. Beauty had become... commonplace. It rarely moved him anymore.\n\nYet Sua overwhelmed him instantly. Those full lips, those penetrating eyes—they seized his attention and refused to release it.\n\n*Something mysterious about her...*\n\nPerhaps their shared Eastern heritage played a role? Grid mentally compared Sua to Yura rather than Jishuka or Irene. Where Yura's overwhelming beauty rendered everything else monochrome—a flower in full bloom—Sua embodied moonlight itself. She radiated a cool allure that stirred unexpected desire. Was it the graceful curve of her pale neck?\n\nUndeniable, yet something felt... off. Despite her elegance, a subtle discord persisted.\n\n*I see.*\n\nGrid realized the issue. Sua was roughly his age—more mature than Yura, who was several years younger.\n\n*Will Yura look like this in a few years?*\n\nHer chest size remained uncertain.\n\n*Would be disappointing if she gets surgical help.*\n\nGrid's wandering thoughts scattered as conversation reached his ears.\n\n\"Is the expedition prepared?\"\n\n\"Yes, we do this daily.\"\n\n\"Captain Horang reported the monsters expanding their territory at an accelerating rate... I'm deeply concerned about how long the Red Phoenix Group can endure this.\"\n\n\"We all understand what Pangea's fall would mean. Don't worry, Father. We're managing our schedule carefully and monitoring everyone's condition.\"\n\nHan Seokbong and Sua discussed grave matters. According to their conversation, dungeon monsters constantly pushed outward, threatening Pangea itself.\n\n*They can't request reinforcements because of the monster community up north.*\n\nWhich raised a question.\n\n*What are the yangbans doing?*\n\nThose individuals possessed power Grid estimated as legendary-tier. Moreover, they belonged to the Hwan Kingdom, affiliated with the Cho Kingdom. Pangea's Red Phoenix Bow itself had been a gift from the Hwan Kingdom. Logic suggested the yangbans would aid Pangea.\n\n*The yangbans could easily resolve the northern monster community or the dungeon crisis.*\n\nSo why did they leave Pangea to struggle alone?\n\n*Works for me, I suppose.*\n\nHe could claim this excellent hunting ground. A grin spread across Grid's face before he averted his gaze from Sua. His face warmed whenever their eyes met. After the disappointment of his first love, Grid remained painfully conscious around women.\n\n\"Ahem. I'd like to enter the castle dungeon.\"\n\nSua responded before her father could. \"May I ask why you wish to enter?\"\n\nHer smile carried an oddly bewitching quality. Grid's face flushed as their eyes met again. He forced his voice to remain steady. \"I need to obtain silver thread.\"\n\n\"Do you know the method for harvesting it? Ah, forgive my rudeness.\" She bowed slightly. \"I'm Han Sua, captain of the Red Phoenix Group responsible for dungeon exploration. Please excuse my late introduction.\"\n\nSua extended her hand. Grid couldn't take it. His ears burned red as he looked away.\n\nSua's dark eyes gleamed strangely.\n\n*This man...*\n\nClearly inexperienced with women. Amusing, in a way. Nothing more than that—she felt no personal interest.\n\n\"I've heard you successfully restored the Red Phoenix Bow. Congratulations. On behalf of Pangea's people, I'll repay this grace. For instance, by gifting you silver thread.\"\n\n\"...!\"\n\nGrid's eyes lit up at the mention of free silver thread—a gift of tremendous value. But both men had already made their decision.\n\n\"No. I'll obtain the silver thread myself.\"\n\nGrid wanted to experience this new dungeon for the experience and levels. More importantly, he wanted to help White avenge his father's death by slaying armored needles. Fighting spirit blazed in both men's eyes.\n\n\"The only way to harvest silver thread is by hunting armored needles. But they're extremely dangerous. Countless people have died to these monsters. One of them...\" Sua's voice softened. \"...was Dawhite.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"It's impossible for non-combatants to hunt armored needles. Even accompanying our expedition would be dangerous. Unfortunately, I cannot grant dungeon access.\"\n\n\"Didn't the lord say I could enter if I withstand one attack from the gatekeeper?\"\n\nSua's expression shifted. \"The gatekeeper isn't ordinary—he's from the Ung Clan. Though untrained in martial arts, his natural abilities defy imagination. Do you truly believe you can endure an attack from someone whose strength rivals an armored needle's? Don't injure yourself out of pride. Give up.\"\n\n*Ung Clan?*\n\nGrid studied the gatekeeper standing near the well. Over two meters tall with a prominent belly—not from obesity, but because his species simply ran larger.\n\n*I can handle it.*\n\nGrid shrugged. \"Don't worry. I can withstand it.\"\n\nHe tried projecting confidence, but his discomfort persisted. He still couldn't meet Sua's gaze directly, acutely aware of her presence.\n\nSua scoffed internally. *Immature male pride, utterly useless.*\n\nSuch futile pride drove people to their limits.\n\n*He has no idea what he's asking for.*\n\nHan Seokbong sighed and whispered to his daughter. \"This is Pangea's savior. Can't you do this once as a favor to your father?\"\n\n\"I'm refusing *because* he's our savior. What if he gets seriously hurt?\"\n\n\"But look at his armor. Doesn't it appear durable? He might lack the mastery to use it optimally, but at least his survival should be guaranteed. Tell Ung to use only thirty percent strength.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe armor was indeed impressive. Multiple sculpted iron plates layered like dragon scales—beautiful craftsmanship.\n\n\"Ten percent is sufficient. Any more and he'll be unconscious for days.\"\n\n\"Yes, wise thinking. We'll make sure he understands not to be too greedy.\"\n\nSua nodded and led Grid and White toward the gatekeeper.\n\nGatekeeper Ung paid no attention to the lord arriving with esteemed guests. He yawned while gazing at distant mountains.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\nSua whispered to Ung, who scratched his head in confusion. \"Strike one of them. Use ten percent of your strength.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nUng snorted like a bull and raised his massive arm.\n\n\"Prepare to move them to the infirmary,\" Sua commanded the Red Phoenix members.\n\n*Whooooom!*\n\nUng's fist slammed into Grid's stomach. The metallic *clang* of impact echoed, followed by a resonating shockwave.\n\n\"This...!\"\n\nSua's eyes widened. Ung had clearly used at least fifty percent of his strength.\n\n\"No!\"\n\nHan Seokbong paled. The man who'd restored the Red Phoenix Bow was about to die before his eyes because of a miscalculation.\n\n\"What's all the fuss—\"\n\nThe Red Phoenix members' troubled expressions froze mid-sentence.\n\n*Shake shake.*\n\nThe fist buried in Grid's stomach began trembling.\n\n\"...Huh?\"\n\nHan Seokbong, Sua, and every Red Phoenix member stared in shock.\n\n*Why is...*\n\n*Is Ung making a pained expression?*\n\nIndeed. Ung's broad face contorted, turning crimson as sweat poured down. Meanwhile, Grid remained perfectly calm.\n\n*Impossible!*\n\n*This can't be happening.*\n\nHan Seokbong and Sua gaped. They'd expected ruptured organs and shattered bones, yet Grid stood unharmed? How incredibly sturdy was his armor? While they stood speechless, someone muttered, \"If his defense is this solid, he'll survive armored needle attacks.\"\n\nGrid gained permission to enter the castle dungeon.\n\nYet Grid looked troubled. Why?\n\n> **[You have suffered severe damage.]**\n> \n> **[Triple Layers has reduced physical damage by 30%.]**\n> \n> **[You have suffered 2,303 damage.]**\n\nUng's punch didn't register as a cut or stab, so Triple Layers' 50% reduction hadn't activated. Substantial damage, considering that was supposedly only ten percent of Ung's power. An armored needle's attack would be several times worse.\n\n*Armored needles... far stronger than I anticipated.*\n\nThey seemed more like boss monsters than common enemies. If they attacked in groups, he'd need to minimize incoming damage.\n\n*The God Hands will be difficult to maneuver in narrow dungeon corridors.*\n\nThis battlefield would demand precise control. Grid's expression grew tense.\n\nWhite looked even more anxious. He stared in shock at the injury on Ung's hand—the one that had struck Grid's armor.\n\n\"I'll... give up for today.\"\n\nWhite decided he could avenge his father through other means. He was, after all, a wise man."
