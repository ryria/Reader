  "content": "*She's far more formidable than I anticipated.*\n\nThe instant White fell, Kasim exhaled sharply, his chest heaving. Even bound by Greed's chains, the woman had exhibited an almost unnatural tenacity. A cold knot of worry tightened in his gut. As Grid ascended in power, so too did his adversaries. One day, that escalation would exact a terrible price.\n\n*The Solo Number Knights concern me most of all.*\n\nThe Saharan Empire's Red Knights were universally acknowledged as the continent's supreme military force. Among them, the Solo Number Knights were said to possess the strength to raze a castle in a single night. But that assessment was woefully inadequate. Before meeting Grid, Kasim had infiltrated the Empire seeking vengeance—and uncovered the truth.\n\nThe Solo Number Knights—particularly the 1st through 7th ranked—wielded power sufficient to topple entire kingdoms. They were chosen as Piaro's potential successors, forged by natural talent and training regimens beyond ordinary comprehension. Each could be considered Piaro's equal.\n\nEven Kasim, King of Shadows, was little more than a candle before their inferno.\n\n*The Empire is a mountain that cannot be climbed.*\n\nGrid needed to grow faster. Stronger. Kasim believed—no, he *knew*—that Grid would one day surpass that mountain. More than that, he would reduce it to rubble. This wasn't blind faith, but conviction rooted in Grid's potential. Until that day arrived, Kasim's role was clear: protect everything Grid held dear. Shield him so he could grow without hindrance.\n\n*To do that, I must become stronger myself.*\n\nThe difficulty was staggering, but the time had come to challenge the fourth advancement class he'd been postponing.\n\n\"Hm? What's that?\"\n\nLost in contemplation, Kasim barely registered Lord's voice. The boy was examining the necklace White had dropped, curiosity bright in his eyes.\n\nKasim chuckled. \"When you defeat enemies or monsters, they occasionally leave behind loot. Spoils for the victor.\"\n\n\"Ohhh...\" Lord's eyes widened with wonder.\n\nWithout hesitation, Kasim offered the necklace to the boy.\n\n\"This artifact reduces skill deployment speed—a rare treasure even the Empire would covet. Keep it safe and use it well.\"\n\nLord shook his head vigorously.\n\n\"No! Master fought those bad people, not Lord! This belongs to you!\"\n\n\"You're growing up too fast.\" Kasim felt a bittersweet mixture of pride and regret. The boy was maturing far beyond his years. \"Please, take it. Consider it a reward for your diligent studies.\"\n\n\"Really? I'm so happy!\"\n\nSuch purity. Watching Lord's eyes shimmer with joyful tears, Kasim felt a pang of guilt.\n\n*I should give him gifts more often. He needs to know he's valued.*\n\nLooking back, Lord had never even received a birthday cake. Grid's constant absence had left a void. How profound must that emptiness be? Kasim vowed to become a teacher who could fill that gap, and smiled.\n\n\"I'll give this to Father. I hope it protects him always.\"\n\n\"You... you're an extraordinary child.\"\n\nIf the Nero Clan hadn't been annihilated by the Empire... would he have lived an ordinary life? Become a father to someone like Lord?\n\n*Though now that I consider it...*\n\nToo much blood stained his hands. He'd dealt despair to countless souls—he had no right to dream of happiness. Kasim lowered his head, expression darkening.\n\nLord grasped his calloused hand and pressed it against his cheek.\n\n\"Warm.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n***\n\n>[**Saintess Ruby has obtained extraordinary rewards in exchange for annihilating the soul of the Great Demon!**]\n>\n>[The **Saintess** class has evolved to **Unique** rating. All skill levels will increase by **two**. Two new skills will be acquired upon reaching **Level 300**.]\n>\n>[The Saintess' signature weapon, the **Wooden Staff**, has evolved to **Unique** rating. Enhancement value has been reset.]\n>\n>[The title **'Denial'** has been acquired.]\n\n>[**Denial**]\n>\n>Your divine power isn't obtained from belief in the gods. It is a unique power built from the worship of the people.\n>\n>In this world created by the gods, only you can deny divinity itself.\n>\n>* When fighting creatures made by gods (Great Demons, divine beasts, demigods, etc.), all your **stats** will increase and your **skill power** will amplify. You can grant them eternal rest.\n>\n>* Your heals will not overlap with heals from priests of other faiths. When targeting the same person, only your heal takes effect.\n\nThis was the content of the special reward Ruby obtained after succeeding in the Great Demon raid. While the class rating evolution was tremendously encouraging, the title's effects seemed... ambiguous. Ruby, whose understanding of game mechanics remained limited, turned to her brother for guidance.\n\n\"This is good, right?\"\n\n\"Mm...\" Grid frowned slightly. \"Boosting a Saintess' **stats** and enhancing her rare offensive capabilities... but it's better than nothing. The improved healing potency will increase raid survival rates.\"\n\nPrivately, Grid felt it was underwhelming for a reward earned by destroying a Great Demon. The penalty particularly troubled him: Ruby's heals would no longer stack with those of other priests. That was unfortunate, given Overgeared's plans to establish a substantial Rebecca Church presence.\n\n*I'll have to abandon the idea of making Sehee head of the healer division.*\n\nThis had occurred mere hours ago. At the time, Grid failed to recognize the true value of the **Denial** title. His perspective shifted, however, after he conceived a plan to reconstruct Lifael's Spear.\n\n*Can Sehee's power suppress Goddess Rebecca's divine energy?*\n\nThe fundamental problem was that Goddess Rebecca's power was overwhelming—so potent it consumed the wielder's vitality. If Sehee could deny that overwhelming divine energy, the burden of White Transformation would be halved, protecting the user from its drain.\n\n*Worth testing.*\n\nResolved, Grid immediately summoned Sehee.\n\n***\n\n\"Success!\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nGrid's hypothesis proved correct.\n\nOnce Sehee purified the goddess' hair, the overwhelming divine power diminished significantly.\n\n>[**Goddess' Fluffy Hair**]\n>\n>Fine strands belonging to Rebecca, Goddess of Light.\n>\n>Contains divine power intolerable to mortals, but the Saintess has halved its potency.\n>\n>**Weight:** 0\n\n*With the divine power weakened, Lifael's Spear's strength will diminish as well.*\n\nA problem Grid would need to overcome through technique and craftsmanship.\n\n\"Hahhh...\"\n\nGrid drew a deep breath, focusing his mind to a razor's edge. He recalled every item he'd forged since becoming Pagma's Descendant.\n\n*The skills and experience I've accumulated aren't insignificant. I can transform Lifael's Spear into something more powerful—something ideal.*\n\nFire blazed in his eyes. Grid sharpened his concentration like a whetstone against steel. Confidence surged through him, fueled by his determination to help Isabel. He produced the white phosphorus wood and began the full-scale crafting process.\n\nIsabel's heart hammered against her ribs.\n\n*He's especially magnificent when he's working at the forge.*\n\n\"...\"\n\nIsabel gazed at Grid with the expression of a maiden discovering first love. Observing this, Damian's expression darkened. Isabel's tender heart, unable to forget her initial infatuation, was both endearing and agonizing. When would she look at *him* that way?\n\n*Perhaps that day will never come...*\n\nResignation settled over him like a shroud. Damian smiled bitterly, dropping his gaze—only to freeze in surprise. Isabel had suddenly grasped his hand.\n\n\"I-Isabel...?\"\n\nThe trembling warmth of Isabel's hand sent Damian's pulse racing. Blushing, Isabel spoke to the stunned paladin.\n\n\"If... if Grid succeeds in freeing me from White Transformation...\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Then I want to accept Your Holiness' feelings.\"\n\n\"Isabel...\"\n\nOnce, Isabel had thought Damian inconsiderate and insensitive—a man who disregarded others' positions while recklessly expressing himself. That assessment had changed. She'd come to understand that despite how easily Damian voiced his affection, the weight behind those words was anything but light.\n\nWatching what Damian did for her—witnessing his unwavering confidence and sincerity—Isabel had developed genuine fondness for him during that revelation. Love that transcended her longing for Grid. What she felt for Damian was *real* love.\n\nYet she'd turned away from his heart. Why? Because of White Transformation. The vitality constantly drained by Lifael's Spear had held her back. She'd believed death was imminent and couldn't accept Damian's devotion.\n\nBut now...\n\n\"Right, let's begin.\"\n\n*Clang! Clang!*\n\nSomeone was sweating for her sake. Grid—the man who'd saved her repeatedly since their first encounter. If anyone could save her again, it would be him.\n\n*Squeeze.*\n\nIsabel tightened her grip on Damian's hand, filled with desperate hope.\n\n*Please... please help me.*\n\nShe longed to experience happiness like any ordinary person. Isabel's fervent prayer reached Grid.\n\n>[**Rebecca's Daughter Isabel is deifying you. Her faith in you is more powerful and desperate than her faith in Goddess Rebecca. This isn't distorted faith—it is a natural phenomenon Goddess Rebecca can understand. You have avoided Goddess Rebecca's wrath.**]\n>\n>[If you have experience creating myth-rated items, you are worthy of deification.]\n>\n>[The title **Glimpsed the Myths** has been updated.]\n\n>[**Glimpsed the Myths**]\n>\n>The minimum qualification to raise your class rating to **'Myth.'**\n\n>[The special stat **'Deity'** has opened!]\n\n>[**Deity**]\n>\n>A sacred dignity beyond mortal tolerance.\n>\n>Every time this stat gains **10 points**, you will acquire a new power. The power manifested will depend on your personality.\n\n\"...\"\n\nWhat just happened? Bewildered, Grid paused mid-swing. His gaze fell on Isabel and Damian, and a warm smile spread across his face. The pair leaned against each other, fingers intertwined, looking for all the world like longtime lovers lost in their own private moment.\n\n*Damian's efforts have borne fruit.*\n\nGrid knew how deeply Damian loved Isabel. Moreover, Grid himself was married to Irene and had a child. Unlike those who dismissed friendship or romance between NPCs and users as mere escapism, Grid genuinely supported Damian and Isabel's relationship.\n\n*If you two have a daughter someday, send her to my Lord.*\n\nSatisfy's roots. The bonds Grid had cultivated were spreading far and wide. Chairman Lim Cheolho once said, *'I hope Satisfy evolves into another world, rather than remaining a mere game.'*\n\n>[**★Hidden Quest★ 'For Isabel's Sake' has been acquired.**]"
