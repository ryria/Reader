Critics mocked his \"subpar control skills\" from the National Competition, and the label stuck.\n\nThat was changing. Right now.\n\nThrough endless grinding and practice, Grid was finally silencing the doubters. One precise dodge at a time.\n\n\"Aura Festival!\"\n\nThe skill erupted in rapid succession. Pop. Pop-pop-pop-pop. Like a string of firecrackers exploding across the battlefield, each detonation creating zones of pressure that compressed the air around Grid.\n\n*Focus.*\n\nThe skill was impressive, sure. But impressive didn't mean unbeatable. Grid's eyes flared crimson. He fed his heightened Insight into his movements, reading the trajectory of each blast before it arrived. The audience watching from around the world leaned forward in their seats.\n\n> **[You have suffered 2,362 damage.]**  \n> **[You have suffered 2,510 damage.]**  \n> **[You have suffered 2,487 damage...]**\n\nAura Festival's true strength lay in its coverage. The explosions blanketed such a wide area that even Grid's agility couldn't dodge them all. But that same spread diluted the impact. Each individual hit was manageable. Grid's Indomitable stat, maxed out by the Doppelganger's accessory set, absorbed the worst of it.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship.\"\n\nThe air itself began to churn. Atmospheric pressure contracted toward Grid as if reality were collapsing inward, pulling everything into a singularity. Energy condensed around him, building to critical mass. This was the pivot point. The moment Grid transformed from close-quarters fighter to ranged artillery.\n\n\"Transcend.\"\n\nHis sword swept forward.\n\n*Boom.*\n\nAn energy blade screamed through the air toward Fulito's position on the ground below. Fast as lightning. Sharp as judgment.\n\n\"Ugh!\"\n\nFulito's world became a storm of devastation. Energy blades rained down relentlessly. One strike from Failure. Another from the Doppelganger's Greatsword. The two massive blades alternated in a rhythm that offered no respite, no chance to breathe.\n\n*This is beyond me.* Fulito sprinted across the fragmenting terrain, feeling the gap between them crystallize into undeniable truth. *He fights like a Single Number Knight.*\n\nThe Single Number Knights stood as legends among the Red Knights. The absolute pinnacle. And Grid's technique mirrored theirs. The moment Aura Festival shattered against Grid's defense, Fulito had known.\n\n*Eternal. That backwater kingdom was hiding a monster.*\n\nThe implications were staggering. Dangerous. The Emperor needed to know. The Eternal Kingdom could no longer be dismissed as insignificant.\n\n*Crack.*\n\nThe next blade caught his right shoulder.\n\n*Damn it.*\n\nHelpless. Absolutely helpless against this bombardment. Fulito activated Super Armor.\n\nBrilliant golden light wrapped around him in protective layers, neutralizing the incoming energy blades. The defense held strong, but the skill's duration ticked away too fast. Fulito barked orders to the Black Knights.\n\n\"I'm retreating! Tie him down and buy me time!\"\n\nDesperation colored every syllable. The Black Knights' faces went pale behind their helmets. They knew what this meant. Sacrifice. But duty overrode survival. They drew their swords and charged toward Grid's aerial position, throwing themselves into the path of his energy blades to shield Fulito's escape.\n\nGrid cancelled Transcend. He dropped to the ground, switching tactics mid-descent.\n\n\"Link.\"\n\nHis voice cut through the chaos.\n\n\"This is Huroi's share.\"\n\nPayment for their crime. For attacking his guild member.\n\n*Clang. Claaaang.*\n\nThe Black Knights' desperate offensive met Link's rapid-fire counters. Then Grid transitioned seamlessly from defense to annihilation.\n\n*Thud-thud-thud-thud-thud.*\n\nBlood spurted from the gaps in black armor. Grid's swordsmanship, enhanced by Vital Spot Detection, had matured far beyond what it once was. Each strike found weakness with surgical precision.\n\n\"Don't let him—!\"\n\nThe Black Knights rallied for a counterattack. All five converged on Grid simultaneously, unleashing their strongest skills. Defense abandoned. Everything committed to offense. A textbook crisis point.\n\nThe global audience held its breath.\n\n*Will Grid die here?*\n\nViewers forgot about the chicken going cold on their plates.\n\nGrid's white hooded zip-up blurred into motion. He'd absorbed this technique from watching Piaro spar with Faker. His body became a spinning top. Five skills converged on the space he'd occupied. Two non-targeted abilities found empty air. The remaining three grazed him, dealing minor damage.\n\n\"Shit!\"\n\nFrustration died in their throats as blue light engulfed the Black Knights.\n\n\"Wave.\"\n\nThe technique erupted outward, energy rippling through the five knights like a shockwave.\n\n\"This is my share!\"\n\nPunishment for raising their blades against him.\n\n\"*Guhk*!\"\n\nThe energy waves battered the Black Knights, drawing screams. Three of their skills connected with Grid during the exchange, but he took less damage than they did. Natural outcome. Grid wore armor forged by the legendary blacksmith Pagma from god-tier minerals. The gap in defense was insurmountable.\n\n\"This is my share! Pinnacle!\"\n\n\"Why do you have *another* share?!\"\n\nThe Black Knights couldn't process Grid's logic. He was claiming more vengeance than Huroi, the actual victim. But their confusion didn't stop the skill from landing.\n\n*Crunch.*\n\nWave's effects slowed the Black Knights' movements. Pinnacle shattered the front knight's armor completely. Failure's passive option triggered in a cascade of destruction.\n\n> **[You have defeated Black Knight Dever.]**  \n> **[8,960,000 experience has been acquired.]**  \n> **[79]**  \n> **[Your level has risen.]**\n\nThe notification glowed in Grid's vision. Combined with Kamiyan's massive experience drop, the level up felt like a reward for excellence. Level 296. Four more levels until 300. Until the third stats awakening.\n\nGrid grinned behind his mask as he bisected the knight's corpse.\n\nThe sight was unsettling. That eerie red light glowing behind the Slaughterer's Mask. Blood splattered across demonic features. A laugh escaping from something that looked more monster than man.\n\nIn the chat, old fans stirred with recognition.\n\n*- It reminds me of the early days.*  \n*- When Grid was called the Butcher?*  \n*- Right. When he went up against the Giant Guild. A regular user challenging a major guild. That was exhilarating.*\n\nRankers attracted fans by doing the impossible. By achieving what ordinary players could only dream of. That vicarious thrill created devotion. The global audience was experiencing it now, even those tuning in through international web channels. The anti-fan brigade fell silent.\n\nGrid activated Fly magic, phasing through the disintegrating remains of the Black Knight. He accelerated toward Fulito, then dismissed Braham's Boots mid-flight. Grid's Boots materialized on his feet.\n\nThe Fly spell cut out.\n\nGrid's body, suddenly heavy with the weight-enhancing boots, plummeted like a meteor. Fulito raised his sword to intercept the descending greatswords.\n\n\"Red Sword!\"\n\nOne of the secret techniques passed down through generations of Red Knights. A skill reserved only for those ranked in the tens or higher.\n\nFlames wreathed Fulito's blade. Golden aura transformed into crimson fire. The technique he unleashed carried enough destructive force to level a small mountain.\n\nBut the audience knew better.\n\n*- Grid has stronger skills.*  \n*- Legendary-tier.*\n\n\"Kill.\"\n\nThe weight from Grid's Boots amplified Kill's momentum. The legendary skill descended with absolute authority.\n\n*BOOM.*\n\n\"What?!\"\n\nKill smashed through Red Sword as if it were paper. Three hundred years of Red Knight tradition crumbled beneath that single blow. Fulito's expression registered pure shock. He managed to deflect half of Kill's power with Limit Sword, but it wasn't enough.\n\n\"Who the hell are you?!\" Fulito's voice cracked. \"How could someone this strong remain unknown until now?\"\n\nHis entire assessment had been wrong. Fulito had attributed Grid's power to artifacts. The golden spear. The legendary equipment. But that was misreading the situation entirely. Grid's true strength came from his swordsmanship. A transcendent technique that exceeded normal boundaries.\n\nTranscendent was not hyperbole. Grid had inherited Pagma's legacy as both legendary blacksmith and supreme swordsman. He'd trained under Piaro's brutal tutelage. The environmental factors alone positioned him to surpass existing legends.\n\nThe problem had always been his natural talent.\n\nOr lack thereof.\n\n\"Unknown?\" Grid's voice carried amusement. \"I'm pretty famous, actually.\"\n\nThe Red Knights lived in a bubble. They believed the Saharan Empire *was* the world. Grid understood they were frogs in a well, and he drove Failure toward Fulito's heart without hesitation.\n\n\"It won't be that easy!\"\n\nFulito burned his trump card. Super Sensitivity activated for five seconds of absolute clarity. He sidestepped Failure's thrust and closed the distance to Grid's side. The skill overclocked his brain, causing neural strain. Fulito had already accepted death.\n\n*If I die here, I'm taking you with me.*\n\nThe last resort. But by the time he reached attack range, the Doppelganger's Greatsword was already in motion.\n\nGrid had predicted this. When a greatsword thrust fails, how does the opponent respond? He'd fought Randy's Pagma clone over eighty times. The pattern recognition was absolute.\n\n*Thump.*\n\n\"This can't—!\"\n\n\"Goodbye, fake knight.\"\n\nPiaro and Asmophel. Those were the only Red Knights who could threaten Grid. Actually, Piaro's strength exceeded Grid's own. Compared to those monsters, Fulito was nothing.\n\n\"*Kuhaha*...! You might have beaten Kamiyan and me! But there are Red Knights I can't even compare with! The Single Number Knights will destroy you!\"\n\n\"Stop monologuing.\"\n\nGrid hadn't even used his full arsenal in this fight. Multiple items and title effects remained in reserve.\n\n\"You bastard!\"\n\nFulito still had a third of his health remaining despite the heart pierce. He gathered aura in secret while maintaining the conversation, planning to detonate it point-blank and chain into a finishing combo. But Grid's blades moved faster than the aura could explode.\n\n\"Where do you think you're going?\"\n\nGrid recognized the telltale energy buildup. Failure and the Doppelganger's Greatsword crossed repeatedly in a lethal dance, carving through Fulito's remaining health.\n\nFulito's HP bar bottomed out.\n\nGrid confirmed the kill, then shifted his focus to the future.\n\n*Bring it on, Pascal.*\n\nAnyone who targeted Grid's life would pay the price. The bill always came due.\n\nMultiple notification windows bloomed in his vision. Grid reviewed them as Fulito collapsed, the 19th Red Knight falling like so many others before him.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms:** [Link]  \n**OG:** [Glossary Link]\n\nCurrent schedule: 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
