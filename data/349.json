  "content": "# Chapter 349\n\nFour months ago in Satisfy time.\n\nKraugel had spent one month with Piaro. He'd watched the man's every move, crossed blades with him thirty times, and stood witness when the legendary farmer awakened. If anyone understood Piaro's strength, it was him.\n\n*The level gap is massive.*\n\nWhen they'd parted ways, Piaro had been level 380. Not speculation. Kraugel had calculated it using every available indicator, cross-referenced against known benchmarks. His understanding of the game's systems was absolute.\n\n*And now?*\n\nThe math put Piaro somewhere between 385 and 386. A conclusion drawn from studying experience curves and NPC growth rates. Meanwhile, Kraugel's own level sat at 326.\n\n*Sixty levels between us.*\n\nThirty percent less damage dealt. Thirty percent more damage received. A brutal handicap, made worse by the statistical chasm between normal classes and legendary ones. Yet Kraugel's expression remained calm.\n\n*The odds are good enough.*\n\nSince Satisfy's launch, he'd held first place. First in every field. A mountain of achievements and titles sat in his possession. Enough to bridge the gap in level and class.\n\n*Besides.*\n\nPiaro's farming technique derived from swordsmanship. Plow, sickle, hand plow, flail—unconventional weapons, certainly, but the underlying forms remained rooted in blade work.\n\n*Swordsmanship is meant for swords.*\n\nUsing such techniques with farming equipment? Inefficient. Suboptimal. The fatal flaw of the 'farmer' Piaro. This was why Kraugel believed victory was possible.\n\n*I just need to avoid the instant kill.*\n\nFated to Perish. The technique that had logged Zibal out in a single strike.\n\n*Can't let him use it.*\n\nThe recent broadcast of 'Polishing' had caused a stir across the playerbase, but Kraugel's attention remained fixed on Fated to Perish.\n\n*Clink.*\n\nHe drew White Fang. The legendary blade he'd claimed from Drasion, one of the great demons felled by Sword Saint Muller.\n\n\"Can you give me a chance to attack first?\"\n\nIn any duel, initiative mattered. A brief but definite advantage. Kraugel weighed the penalties he faced and decided this concession wasn't unreasonable.\n\nPiaro should refuse. Any rational opponent would. But Piaro had spent his life being called the strongest. His confidence bordered on arrogance.\n\n\"I'll accept.\"\n\nExactly as predicted. Piaro handed Kraugel an opening, and Kraugel had no intention of wasting it.\n\n*He's a legend. His stamina will dwarf mine. A long fight favors him. I need to end this quickly.*\n\n*Pahat!*\n\nThe sun blazed overhead. Under intense sunlight or moonlight, his footwork bent light around his body. White Light Steps. In the past, the technique's stealth function had fooled Piaro completely.\n\nNot anymore. Piaro's hand plow intercepted White Fang's strike toward his left side with casual precision.\n\n*Chaaeng!*\n\n*The level gap is too large.*\n\nStealth was useless. Without White Light Steps' primary advantage, his odds dropped by one percent.\n\n*Still within acceptable parameters.*\n\nKraugel's composure didn't crack. Even facing the worst outcome, he remained steady. A mindset befitting his position at the summit. Piaro blocked White Fang with the hand plow in his left hand while his right swept the sickle diagonally.\n\nThe strike came fast. Faster than Kraugel's calculations predicted.\n\n*What?*\n\nHow could Piaro's agility exceed his estimates so drastically? Surprise flickered through Kraugel, but his body moved without error.\n\n*Chaaeng! Chaeng! Chaaeng!*\n\nIn the span of a tenth of a second, Kraugel evaded Piaro's attack and counterattacked. No conscious thought required. Pure experience and reflexes honed through countless battles. The passive skill Keen Senses helped, sharpening his awareness beyond human limits.\n\n*Chaaeng!*\n\n\"Kuk!\"\n\nA grunt escaped Kraugel's lips. He'd blocked the hand plow and sickle with White Fang, but the strength behind them rattled his bones. Most fighters would taste despair feeling such a gap. Kraugel found opportunity instead.\n\n\"Tearing the Sky.\"\n\n*Kwajak! Kwajajajak!*\n\nOne of the White Swordsman's ultimate techniques manifested. Spectral beast claws tore through the air, colliding with Piaro's equipment.\n\n*Chaaeng!*\n\nHairline cracks spiderwebbed across the hand plow and sickle. Blood welled from Piaro's chest.\n\n*The equipment my lord crafted...!*\n\nShock registered in Piaro's eyes. Farming tools made by a legendary blacksmith, damaged by a single blow. Yet Kraugel felt even greater surprise.\n\n*The damage is too low.*\n\nTearing the Sky's formula was complex. A counter skill with limited trajectories, calculating user attack power plus enemy attack power. He'd predicted at least forty thousand damage. Instead, barely seven thousand.\n\n*Piaro must be over level 400.*\n\nShit. The level difference was too vast for damage formulas to apply properly. The fourth stat awakening erected a wall that titles and achievements couldn't scale.\n\n*How? How did he grow so fast?*\n\nWhat Kraugel didn't know: Chris, high-level players, and Grid were responsible. Piaro had been converting every ranker who visited Reidan into farmers, training them relentlessly. His spar with Grid alone had provided explosive growth.\n\nA pity, really.\n\n*Swaeek!*\n\nThe flail caught Kraugel while his thoughts wandered. His eyes widened as he tried to predict the trajectory.\n\n*Not swordsmanship?*\n\nPiaro had shifted from blade techniques to pure farming forms. An entirely new combat style. The strength of 'Sword Saint Candidate' Kraugel—his ability to read and counter any swordsmanship—became worthless.\n\n*Peeeeok!*\n\n\"Ugh!\"\n\nThe flail connected cleanly. Kraugel's shoulders jerked. His right arm, still gripping White Fang, went numb with paralysis. Piaro read the status affliction instantly.\n\n*Counterattacking is impossible.*\n\nKraugel would evade. Likely using White Light Steps. Piaro anticipated this and swung the flail.\n\n*Suuk.*\n\nInstead of retreating, Kraugel surged forward. Different footwork. Not White Light Steps. Brilliant movement that closed the distance, negating the flail's reach advantage.\n\nA precursor to 'Hwimori.'\n\n*Peok! Pepeok! Pepepepeok!*\n\nKraugel had reached the East Continent with the sage Sticks' help. Before changing classes, he'd explored that foreign land and absorbed the fast, irregular footwork of a martial artist he'd encountered. Piaro felt like he was fighting a ghost as kicks hammered into him from impossible angles.\n\nBut.\n\n\"It's just a tickle!\"\n\nPiaro had endured Tearing the Sky. These kicks were nothing. He accepted every strike without flinching, then shouldered Kraugel aside. The flail retracted while his other hand produced a plow.\n\n\"Free Farming 4th Style, Plowing the Field.\"\n\n*Sururuk.*\n\nKraugel stumbled. The earth beneath him vanished, cleared in an instant. Piaro reached for seeds when a storm of kicks interrupted him.\n\n*Puk. Puk puk! Puuoooook!*\n\nFast and light, but weak. Yet something in the technique was affecting Piaro's body.\n\n\"Cough!\"\n\nBlack blood spattered from Piaro's lips. Kraugel's paralysis faded.\n\n\"Storm Sword.\"\n\n*Kwa kwa kwa kwang!*\n\nBlades of light shredded Piaro's worn clothing. His health gauge ticked downward as successive attacks landed. Yet no frustration showed on his face. Instead, his fighting spirit surged higher.\n\n\"Fun!\"\n\nA different power from Grid's. An opponent who excited Piaro to his core. He'd missed this feeling. The excited farmer struck at a water vein beneath the soil.\n\n*Peeng!*\n\nA geyser erupted, slamming into Kraugel's body. Piaro chained Sowing and Rapid Growth together.\n\n*Kwarururung!*\n\n*Legendary skills...!*\n\nKraugel's face paled as thorny vines exploded from the cleared earth, growing at unnatural speed. He escaped through the air using White Light Steps and repositioned White Fang. The manifestation of 'Meteor Sword.'\n\n*Kwa kwa kwa kwang!*\n\nThe entire area scorched. Meteor blades fell from Kraugel's sword, cutting through the thorny barrier. At the field's center, White Fang and Piaro's hand plow collided head-on.\n\n*He blocked Meteor Sword...!*\n\nEven Kraugel's composure cracked. He launched a nervous onslaught. Thunderous impacts rang out as Piaro's farming equipment intercepted every strike. Piaro's eyes gleamed with recognition.\n\n*He's already adapted to my farming techniques!*\n\nKraugel's vision exceeded Piaro's own. Strike by strike, Kraugel crushed the seven farming tools, carving fresh wounds across Piaro's body. Pure control ability and battle instinct made manifest.\n\nBut the level difference remained.\n\nPiaro still held two-thirds of his health despite the punishment. Kraugel had evaded most attacks, yet his health had fallen below half. His higher agility burned through stamina faster.\n\n*White Light Sword won't work.*\n\nThe technique blinded opponents, allowing follow-up attacks. But Piaro was a legend. Immune to crowd control effects. Against such an opponent, a White Swordsman couldn't unleash full power.\n\n*No. Those are excuses.*\n\nHe'd faced countless CC-immune enemies and beaten them all. Control had always compensated for his shortcomings. Yet against Piaro, his skills weren't enough.\n\nThe instant that thought formed—\n\n\"I guess I should use all my power.\"\n\nPiaro narrowly avoided a vicious wound and spoke. Then Natural State activated. His stats amplified, overturning the battle's flow. Now Kraugel was the one taking hits.\n\nSpeed and power enhanced by Natural State overwhelmed Kraugel. Most of his health evaporated in seconds. His eyes flashed.\n\n\"Super Sensitivity.\"\n\n> [Super Sensitivity has been used.]\n> [100% of your mana has been consumed.]\n> [For the next six seconds, all senses transcend cognition.]\n> [Agility is increased by 20% and you can 100% predict the behavior of all objects within 10 meters.]\n> [This will be exhausted in six seconds.]\n\nKraugel's true strength didn't come from skills or titles. It came from innate ability. The moment Super Sensitivity activated, he was reborn.\n\n*Seokeok!*\n\nEnough to overcome Piaro's enhanced speed. Enough to deal a deadly blow.\n\n*What?*\n\nAn unfamiliar sensation gripped Piaro. Not because he'd been wounded. Wounds were familiar territory. No, the problem was his instincts. They screamed danger. Warned him not to confront Kraugel directly.\n\n*Run away?*\n\nHis fighting spirit peaked. The moment his pride as the strongest was threatened, he revealed a technique he hadn't even used against Grid.\n\n\"Free Farming Peak Style!\"\n\n*This—!*\n\nKraugel's transcendent perception, granted by Super Sensitivity, recognized the danger. Something he couldn't resist. He tried to escape the moment Piaro's expression turned serious. Too late.\n\n\"Pounding Mortar!\"\n\n*Kuwaaaaaang!*\n\nDisaster struck. Something massive plummeted from the heavens and bored into the earth like a mortar shell. Simultaneously, all of Reidan shook. An earthquake made flesh.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**\n**OG:** Glossary Link.\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
