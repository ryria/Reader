  "content": "The moment Grid laid eyes on the giant cave cricket, one thought crystallized in his mind: *This thing isn't meant for players.*\n\nThe evidence was overwhelming. Its appearance alone—a nightmarish amalgamation of bulging compound eyes, elongated mandibles, twitching antennae, and translucent chitin—would send most people running to therapists. Two legendary-class NPCs had struck it without bringing it down. And its sheer presence radiated wrongness, like stumbling into a cutscene boss three expansions too early.\n\n*Some poor bastard's going to log in, see this thing, and sue S.A. Group for emotional distress.*\n\nGrid had been grinding through Satisfy since the beta. Unlike the prodigies who soared through the rankings, he'd scraped along the bottom long enough to recognize patterns. This was an event monster—something tied to a specific quest line or story trigger. The kind of creature that wasn't supposed to spawn in normal gameplay.\n\nBehind him, leather hit the ground.\n\nGrid glanced back reflexively and found Mercedes changing into the new armor. The discarded leather armor lay crumpled at her feet. His Legendary Blacksmith's Eyes analyzed it automatically.\n\n[Old Leather Armor]\n\n[Durability: 15/140 Defense: 60\n\nThe armor Legendary Knight Mercedes wore as Piaro's aide. Once serviceable, the years have reduced it to little more than scraps held together by habit.\n\nWeight: 290\n\nUser Restriction: Level 180 or higher.]\n\n\"You've got to be kidding me.\"\n\nLevel 180 restriction for *sixty defense*? That was worse than most level 20 gear. Mercedes had been fighting in what amounted to decorative rags.\n\nHe turned to check on her progress—then immediately squeezed his eyes shut, heat flooding his face. She'd stripped down to nothing, halfway into donning the red and purple plate armor.\n\nMercedes, for her part, showed no embarrassment whatsoever. For a knight, this was simply the process of equipping gear.\n\n\"To blame one's equipment is shameful,\" she said, her voice carrying that unwavering determination as she adjusted the armor's fittings. \"However... after using the sword you lent me, I've reconsidered.\" \n\nShe tightened the final strap, then met his gaze directly.\n\n\"Overgeared. That's what you call it, isn't it? Then I, too, shall become Overgeared.\"\n\n[Legendary Knight Mercedes has established a new chivalric code.]\n\n[All of Mercedes' stats have increased by 10%. Each time she wears high-rated equipment, she will receive additional compensation effects.]\n\n[Epic-rated items: +5% to base item stats (excluding options)\nUnique-rated items: +7% to base item stats (excluding options)  \nLegendary-rated items: +10% to base item stats (excluding options)  \nMyth-rated items: +20% to base item stats (excluding options)]\n\n[Legendary Knight Mercedes has equipped the Hero King's Armor.]\n\n[Heavy armor class bonus applied: **Defense +20%**]\n\n[Myth-rated equipment bonus applied: **All armor stats +20%**]\n\nGrid's jaw went slack. The chivalric code system was even more broken than he'd realized. A simple declaration, and Mercedes gained a permanent 10% stat boost plus scaling bonuses on every piece of equipment she'd ever wear.\n\nMeanwhile, his own legendary class—Pagma's Descendant—let him craft absurdly powerful items, but wearing them did nothing for his personal growth. Kraugel could create custom skills through Sword Saint techniques. Mercedes got stronger every time she made a resolution.\n\n*My attack power's going to fall behind at this rate...*\n\n\"My strength is yours, Your Majesty.\"\n\nMercedes' soft voice pulled him from his thoughts. When he looked at her again, his breath caught.\n\nShe was *magnificent*.\n\nThe white hair framing translucent skin, contrasted against crimson and violet plate armor—it stole the words from his throat.\n\n[Hero King's Armor]\n\n[Rating: Myth  \nDurability: 1,430/1,430 **Defense: 1,190**\n\n* **Strength +200**\n* The wearer's two highest stats increase by **15%**. If Strength or Intelligence is affected, gain **+300 Attack Power or Physical Defense**. If Agility is affected, gain **+12% Accuracy and Evasion**.\n* Magic resistance increases proportional to the wearer's Intelligence.\n* The effect of the wearer's highest level skill increases by **25%**.\n* The cooldown of the wearer's two lowest level skills decreases by **10%**.\n* **Attack Power +5** per consecutive hit (maximum **+500**).\n* Wide-range skill damage increased by **20%**.\n* When wielding a large weapon: **Attack Power +10%**, **Attack Speed +5%**.\n* Low probability of accumulating 'Incomplete Fighting Energy.' Stats rise with every 10 points gained.\n\nAn armor forged by the legendary blacksmith Grid—whom even gods acknowledge—for the legendary knight Mercedes. Heavy plate crafted from black mithril infused with the red energy of Saharan's Emperor, reinforced with ogre bone, rosar tin, and Grid's own fighting energy. The rosar tin limits maximum defense but grants escalating aggression as battle continues.\n\nWeight: 3,020  \nConditions of Use: Grid or Mercedes]\n\nUnsellable. Unmarketable. And Grid didn't care one bit.\n\nThis armor existed for Mercedes alone. He couldn't guarantee he'd ever acquire another piece of imperial black mithril, anyway.\n\n*Less defense for more offense. Let's see how it performs.*\n\nMercedes strode forward, each step measured and purposeful as Piaro's Growth skill transformed the forest into tilled farmland. The giant cave cricket's antennae twitched. Its aggro locked onto her instantly.\n\nThe monster moved.\n\nOne moment it was distant. The next, its bladed leg scythed through the air, cutting space itself in 0.1 seconds to reach Mercedes' position.\n\nEven with a 10% stat boost from her new chivalric code, Mercedes couldn't fully dodge. The creature was too fast, exploiting every micro-gap in her defense with insectile precision. So she didn't try to dodge.\n\nShe *attacked*.\n\nBefore, wearing the leather armor, she'd been forced to block. Now she charged straight through.\n\nThe cricket made a confused chittering sound as this small creature *clung* to its leg, blood spraying from her side. The scent of copper filled the air.\n\n\"It hurts,\" Mercedes admitted through gritted teeth, adjusting her grip on the White Tiger Sword.\n\nBut she didn't stop walking.\n\nFour meters. Three.\n\nThe cricket's danger sense flared—that pure insectile instinct recognizing a predator in prey's clothing. Mercedes' offense had increased dramatically, and it had no intention of letting her close the distance.\n\n\"Kuk...!\"\n\nThe creature's speed doubled. Mercedes activated White Tiger's Attitude just as cracks spiderwebbed across her armor's plating. She advanced one slow, inexorable step at a time.\n\nThen four golden shapes streaked past her—Grid's God Hands, joining the assault.\n\nAbove, fighting energy condensed into a storm.\n\nGrid hung suspended in the air, the Enlightenment Sword blazing in his grip.\n\n\"**Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle!**\"\n\nThe sky split apart.\n\nThe signal had been given.\n\n\"**Growth! Threshing! Polishing!**\"\n\nPiaro's skills erupted in sequence. Fast-growing crops burst from the soil, then detonated in waves of shrapnel and earth. The farmland collapsed inward, forcing the battlefield into a funnel with Mercedes at the narrow end—the only path to reach the cricket.\n\n\"**OHHHHH!**\"\n\nThe accumulated attack bonus from the Hero King's Armor triggered. Mercedes' blades, which had barely scratched the cricket's carapace before, now *punched through*, severing nerves and piercing organs. The creature thrashed, eight legs flailing in random directions, creating a nauseating kaleidoscope of limbs.\n\nGrid didn't flinch.\n\nHe'd seen children raised as livestock in the Tower of Eternity. A giant bug didn't rate.\n\nLinked Kill Wave Pinnacle hammered down, pulverizing the cricket's shell.\n\n\"**Fated to Perish!**\"\n\nPiaro's ultimate technique carved into exposed flesh.\n\n*KYAK KYAK! KYAK KYAK KYAK!*\n\n\"**Lightning Discharge!** Discharge, nyong! Nyang nyang nyang!\"\n\nThe Overgeared Skeletons, Randy, and Noe piled on, attacks blurring together. The cricket's death shriek shook the dawn forest. God's Command activated—cooldown reset.\n\nGrid unleashed a second **Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle**.\n\n[Your level has risen!]\n\nThe notification bloomed before his eyes. A welcome sight. The pet experience and item drops would be nice bonuses—\n\n[Your contracted beast Noe's level has risen!] x8\n\n[Doppelganger Randy's level has risen!] x3\n\n[Overgeared Skeletons One and Two's levels have risen!] x15\n\n[Ancient Weapon Enhancement Scrolls acquired.] x3\n\n[Ancient Armor Enhancement Scrolls acquired.] x5\n\n[Ancient Steel acquired.] x59\n\n[Shell of an Ancient Species acquired.] x67\n\n...This wasn't a bonus.\n\nThis was a *jackpot*."
