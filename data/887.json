Picasso had reached such heights—and the Overgeared Guild knew it.\n\n\"It's an honor to have you with us.\"\n\n\"We'll be counting on you.\"\n\nGuild members converged on Reinhardt from across the kingdom, abandoning their territorial duties and ranking grinds to welcome the legendary painter. They also planned to visit the newly minted 10 meritorious retainers while they were at it.\n\n\"Come to Bairan after you're done in Reinhardt,\" Jishuka suggested.\n\n\"Reidan first,\" Chris countered. \"Or have you forgotten it's the second capital?\"\n\n\"Reidan's massive. Too many facilities. Starting with Bairan makes more strategic sense.\"\n\n\"Strategic sense? That's just your rural thinking showing.\"\n\nJishuka's smile turned dangerous. \"Rural? Oh, Chris seems to have grown a spine. Should I remind you what happened in L.T.S? Or do you miss having arrows in your ass?\"\n\n\"Why bring up ancient history? Should I mention how Zirkan used to tie you in knots?\"\n\n\"What does Zirkan have to do with—\"\n\n\"You're being overly sensitive.\"\n\n\"Excuse me? Is that how you talk to a lady? You want to settle this right now?\"\n\n\"Only if you don't use the Red Phoenix Bow.\"\n\n\"An Overgeared member *should* be overgeared!\"\n\nGrid observed the bickering with weary familiarity. Their enthusiasm made sense—a painter's masterpieces weren't mere decoration in Satisfy. A portrait of a brave warrior in a barracks could boost soldier morale and training efficiency. A landscape painting might cool a sweltering city. A still life in a restaurant would enhance the chef's cooking.\n\nThe greater the artist, the more powerful the effects.\n\n*Picasso's recruitment will be written into our kingdom's history.*\n\nLauel practically vibrated with excitement. The prideful master painter who rejected most commissions had *applied* to join them.\n\n*All because of the Hexetia portrait. Grid's description of the god must have resonated with her artistic soul.*\n\nHe knew why people joined the guild—himself included. They were drawn to Grid's gravity, wanted something only he could provide. The Overgeared Kingdom existed because of one man.\n\n\"Kuk...kukukuk!\" Lauel covered half his face dramatically. \"King Grid, you were surely born beneath a blessed star! Looking at you awakens memories of a past life I'd forgotten. Even then, you possessed a presence like the sun—Kuk! Kukuk! My soul trembles!\"\n\nGrid's toes curled with secondhand embarrassment. He said nothing. His mind was too occupied to engage with Lauel's theatrics.\n\n*Better than expected.*\n\nThe Hexetia temple construction had begun smoothly, but Grid's thoughts lingered on Drop—the skill he'd tested on the journey back. \n\n*The motion is incredibly compact.*\n\nOne step. Half a step, really. Step and swing simultaneously. Nearly instantaneous activation—drastically faster than existing sword dances that required two to four steps.\n\nIt could chain directly from basic attacks.\n\nIt worked on targets completely immune to crowd control.\n\n*Theoretically... it could affect gods or dragons.*\n\nIf he'd possessed this during the 3rd National Competition, the world would have witnessed him bring low that colossal dragon. The tactical applications...\n\n*The fusion skills will be devastating.*\n\nWith such short motions, linking it to other techniques should be seamless.\n\n*Linked Drop. Kill Drop. Wave Drop. Revolve Drop. Pinnacle Drop.*\n\nHe frowned. The names sounded... underwhelming.\n\n*Must be the Korean. Probably sounds epic in other languages.*\n\nWhile Grid consoled himself, Picasso approached. \"I want to paint you.\"\n\n\"Me?\" Grid blinked.\n\nThe smithy fell silent. Lauel, Jishuka, Chris, Pon—every guild member present stared with dropped jaws.\n\nLauel's whisper came urgently: *—Accept! Her portraits have a special effect!*\n\n*—What kind of effect?*\n\n*—Unknown. Rumors started circulating after she painted noble portraits. The details are still secret, but the fact that aristocrats across multiple kingdoms offered fortunes for her work suggests something significant.*\n\nCountless artists could paint realistic portraits suitable for decoration. Any competent painter could manage that much. But nobles specifically sought Picasso's brush—there had to be a reason.\n\n*—She's never painted a player before. You'd be the first. Whatever hidden properties her portraits have, you'll be the one to discover them.*\n\n*—Understood.*\n\nNo reason to refuse. More importantly, rejecting a colleague's goodwill would be disrespectful. She'd approached him with genuine intention.\n\n\"All right. I'd be honored.\"\n\nPicasso had perfectly captured God Hexetia's divine form. Grid felt mild curiosity about how she'd render him, though his expectations remained low. After all, it was his own unremarkable face that would be immortalized on canvas. Years of being unloved had taught him to feel embarrassed about his appearance being displayed so prominently.\n\n\"The reception's over. Let's relocate.\" Picasso studied him. \"I need a place where I can glimpse your true face.\"\n\nGrid understood after a moment's confusion.\n\n*The smithy.*\n\nHe needed to repair his equipment anyway. \"Yes. Let's go.\"\n\n***\n\nThe Overgeared Kingdom's main smithy dwarfed any forge on the continent.\n\nPicasso set up her easel, watching Grid work the bellows and anvil. Her expression turned wistful. \"I don't presume to judge humans, but I sympathize with Hexetia.\"\n\n\"Why's that?\" Grid's hammer rang against heated steel.\n\n\"I was the first to reproduce his image. It granted me high affinity with him.\" She mixed pigments thoughtfully. \"He contributed so much to humanity's advancement—but because Goddess Rebecca commanded it, she received all the praise. People forgot Hexetia entirely. He appeared briefly in creation's dawn, then... nothing.\"\n\nThe hammer's rhythm never faltered. \"I'd feel bitter too, in his position.\"\n\n*She understands.*\n\nArtists possessed heightened empathy, a natural sensitivity to unspoken truths. Picasso's next question came carefully: \"Where did you see Hexetia's form? His appearance has never been recorded. How did you know?\"\n\n\"Nothing extraordinary. A quest revealed his image.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nA quest that showed a god's true appearance. How many players could claim such an experience? Grid had climbed far higher than she'd imagined.\n\n\"For a painting to be recognized as a masterpiece,\" Picasso said quietly, \"four conditions must align. First: the artist's skill must reach a certain threshold. Second: the artist's purpose in creating the work. Third: the artist's state of mind during creation. Fourth: the weight of the subject within their era.\"\n\nShe looked directly at Grid. \"Weight isn't about titles or status. It's about significance—how deeply a person shapes the age they inhabit.\"\n\nPicasso intended to make Grid the protagonist of her next masterpiece. She'd completed only four in her career: three depicting nature's majesty, and yesterday's portrait of Hexetia.\n\nShe'd never created a masterpiece featuring a *person.* Her noble portraits were technically excellent, but the system never elevated them—masterpieces required universal significance. Noble reputations, however illustrious, remained too narrow.\n\n*Grid is different.*\n\nA man who'd founded a kingdom. Challenged the heavens. Witnessed divinity. The system wouldn't underestimate his weight.\n\n*This will benefit us both...*\n\nHer brush moved with delicate precision as Grid hammered glowing metal. Hundreds of blacksmiths watched in awed silence, witnessing a dignity that rivaled God Hexetia himself.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\n\"You want the flames depicted in surrealist style? With *different colors?*\" The sculptor's incredulity was palpable.\n\n\"Yes.\" Rabbit, the kingdom's economic and political administrator, remained unmoved.\n\n\"That's an absurd request! No sculptor worth their chisel would accept such a commission. Where's the inspiration?\"\n\n\"Is depicting flames on nipples truly so difficult? I summoned you because you're supposedly among the best...\" Rabbit's tone sharpened. \"Perhaps the rumors were exaggerated?\"\n\n\"Laypeople always underestimate complexity! Any expert would call this challenging. I'll need a fortnight just for the preliminary work. Do you know how many artisans suffer under unreasonable employers like you?\"\n\n\"Who said anything about restricting your food or drink? I'll extend the deadline. Just make the flames work.\"\n\n\"Eight hundred percent.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Bonus compensation. The scope increased—it's only fair the payment matches.\"\n\n\"One hundred twenty percent.\"\n\n\"Why are you being difficult? To ensure optimal workflow efficiency... eight hundred percent!\"\n\n\"One hundred twenty.\"\n\n\"Eight hundred!\"\n\n\"One hundred twenty!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe negotiation stalled. Two immovable forces had collided. The enlightened Rabbit and the notorious sculptor eyed each other with newfound wariness.\n\n\"Six hundred percent,\" Lauel interjected, arriving late to mediate. A significant concession—but the sculptor remained stubborn as his reputation suggested.\n\n\"Seven hundred ninety-nine percent!\"\n\n\"...Seven hundred.\"\n\n\"Seven hundred ninety-eight! My final offer! That's a *two* percent reduction, not one. I won't budge further unless you offer a bribe!\"\n\nLauel's eye twitched. \"Fine. Seven hundred ninety-eight percent—\"\n\n\"Excellent! Hehe! Much appreciated. I've already ordered premium materials for the sculpture. I'll use even *more* now!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*How did this happen?* Lauel regretted his concession—the sculptor was more mercenary than advertised. The regret lasted mere seconds. Once the sculptor's hands began shaping stone, Lauel's complaints evaporated.\n\nThe emerging form was flawless. Magnificent.\n\n*He's even more skilled than the rumors claimed!*\n\nWorth every copper. It reminded Lauel of watching Grid forge a legendary item.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!*\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nFrom smithy and construction site, twin rhythms of creation echoed through Reinhardt. The blacksmith and sculptor, separated by distance, sensed each other's mastery through the ringing of hammer on metal, chisel on stone.\n\nMutual recognition passed between kindred souls who understood the weight of true craftsmanship."
