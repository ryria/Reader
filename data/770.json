  "content": "\"What in God's name—?\"\n\nInside the S.A. Group headquarters, the National Competition Operations Team descended into chaos.\n\nThe National Competition ran on an isolated server—completely separate from Satisfy's main infrastructure. A dragon existing within Satisfy should be categorically incapable of manifesting here. Yet during the closing ceremony—the most critical event of the entire competition—one had appeared.\n\n\"Find out what's happening! Now!\"\n\n\"On it!\"\n\nThe moment Director Nicol Cage barked the order, his team exploded into motion. These were the S.A. Group's finest minds, and reports began flooding in within minutes.\n\n\"Bunhelier's vanished from the primary server!\"\n\n\"Wait—then that's actually the real creature?\"\n\n\"How is that even possible?\"\n\n\"Found it! The weapon Kraugel's using—his +9 White Fang. There's a summoning option embedded in the item.\"\n\n\"You've got to be kidding me.\"\n\nDespite the isolated server architecture, player data imported into the National Competition retained all original properties. The 'Summon Bunhelier' function had simply been transferred along with everything else. Excluding the summoning probability before the competition would have required preemptive identification—which no one had thought to verify.\n\n\"This is insane. A user possesses an item that can summon a *dragon*?\"\n\n\"Drop from the 'Weakened Great Demon Drasion' raid—Kraugel cleared it solo!\"\n\nThe central monitor displayed White Fang's complete specifications. Originally a sealed item with dormant power, Kraugel had fully unlocked its capabilities—activating the Bunhelier curse option in the process.\n\n\"How does someone break the seal on a legendary weapon? Was there a hidden quest chain?\"\n\n\"No quest unlock history in the logs.\"\n\n\"Most likely scenario... Pagma's Descendant Grid was involved...\"\n\n\"*Again*! It's Grid again!\"\n\nNicol Cage—server audit director and head of the Operations Team—slammed his palm against the desk. His face had gone pale, teeth grinding audibly. His entire job revolved around preventing real-time server errors and bugs, which made Grid's existence a personal nightmare. Every time that man created a variable exceeding normal player parameters, Nicol wound up working overtime.\n\nAnd now? During the National Competition itself?\n\n\"That insufferable—\"\n\nBang!\n\nBefore he could finish the curse, footsteps echoed from the doorway.\n\n\"This situation is very interesting.\"\n\n\"Chairman!\"\n\nNicol's rage evaporated instantly. The gentleman who'd entered was the architect of Supercomputer Morpheus, the creator of Satisfy itself—Lim Cheolho, founder and chairman of the S.A. Group. After a brief greeting and wave to the scrambling staff, he settled into the chair across from Nicol.\n\n\"I'm... I'm sorry, sir.\"\n\nTechnically, this wasn't Nicol's fault—the management team responsible for data verification should have caught this. But as Operations Team leader, he refused to make excuses. The closing ceremony had been compromised under his watch.\n\nLim Cheolho smiled faintly.\n\n\"I don't believe an apology is necessary.\"\n\n\"...Sir?\"\n\nConfusion replaced Nicol's panic. The closing ceremony was in shambles. How could the chairman remain so calm?\n\n\"The water's already been spilled. There's something more important to consider,\" Lim Cheolho said. \"Did you know Bunhelier just woke from his seal?\"\n\nNicol blinked. Of course he knew—it was fundamental world lore. Trempet, that remote village populated by descendants of the fallen Taylor Kingdom, even had folk songs about it: *'Evil dragon, sealed by heroes five hundred years ago.'* Any player who'd visited Trempet knew about Bunhelier. The S.A. Group executives certainly knew the seal had recently broken.\n\n\"The evil dragon Bunhelier is directly connected to Nevartan's madness,\" the chairman continued. \"When Nevartan sensed Bunhelier's seal breaking, the insane dragon briefly regained clarity.\"\n\nFrom that moment, a major episode was supposed to unfold. Seeking revenge against Bunhelier, Nevartan would traverse the globe, eventually converging on the Saharan Empire in the West Continent. The West Continent would become the primary stage for a months-long battle between two dragons—a cataclysm that would destroy most of the region and dramatically reduce the human population.\n\n\"Different species would rise to replace humanity, forcing players to choose sides—or enemies.\"\n\nExcept Bunhelier had just vanished from the server.\n\n\"Without Bunhelier's presence, Nevartan can't maintain his brief lucidity. He's reverted to madness and retreated into hiding. The planned confrontation between the dragons... is cancelled.\"\n\n\"Which means...\"\n\n\"Grid and Kraugel have nullified a disaster event we spent years developing.\"\n\n\"Isn't this a catastrophe?\"\n\nTwo players had single-handedly derailed the game world's trajectory—a world played by billions. Nicol's instinct screamed to restore the original timeline immediately.\n\nBut Chairman Lim Cheolho shook his head.\n\n\"No. We can't reverse this. Have you forgotten our absolute policy regarding Satisfy?\"\n\nManagement would never intervene in Satisfy's natural progression. This rule existed for one reason: to preserve Satisfy's identity as 'another reality.' The instant management began manipulating events or users, the illusion would shatter. Users would remember they were playing a game, breaking their immersion—betraying the very purpose for which Chairman Lim Cheolho had created Satisfy.\n\n\"Users must experience the same freedom they have in reality. We cannot and will not intervene to restore what's been changed.\"\n\n\"But this is an exceptional situation—\" Nicol caught himself. \"...No. You're right.\"\n\nThe non-intervention policy was foundational. Violating it would get him removed by the board of directors. Besides, an episode failing to proceed as Morpheus designed wouldn't truly harm Satisfy's evolution.\n\nMorpheus existed to facilitate player enjoyment in an engaging environment. This particular episode was meant to introduce new species and factions beyond the established kingdoms—but players would pioneer those possibilities themselves regardless. Grid had already demonstrated that by destroying an existing kingdom and building his own.\n\n*'They're even rejecting fate designed by God himself...'*\n\nOn the monitor, Grid and Kraugel faced down a massive grey dragon. Lim Cheolho's expression softened as he watched the two miraculous beings who consistently defied Morpheus' predictions. They reminded him of himself and his employees—breaking expectations to build a virtual reality world everyone said was impossible.\n\n\"Now then,\" the chairman said. \"Release Bunhelier's information.\"\n\n\"Wait—publicly?\"\n\n\"Yes. We'll frame the dragon's appearance as a special event.\" Dragons existed as god-tier entities within Satisfy. The majority of players would never encounter one in their entire careers. According to Morpheus' collected data, only seventeen players had ever glimpsed a dragon from a distance. \"Wouldn't experiencing such an otherworldly presence be thrilling?\"\n\nCrisis into opportunity. If the public perceived the dragon's manifestation as a 'special event' rather than 'competition malfunction,' the outcome could be overwhelmingly positive.\n\n\"But restarting the finals from the beginning would look suspicious. People would realize it's a mistake, not a planned event.\"\n\n\"Who said anything about restarting?\"\n\n\"...Excuse me?\"\n\n\"When Grid and Kraugel fall to Bunhelier, don't log them out. Respawn them inside Bunhelier's lair. Package their deaths as the unlock condition for a new stage.\"\n\nThough the National Competition server was isolated, all Satisfy maps had been implemented—including Bunhelier's nest. The operations team had full authority over National Competition parameters. They modified rules annually.\n\n\"This is entirely manageable. Bunhelier's appearance becomes dramatic storytelling that captivates the audience.\"\n\nThis year's PvP finals would shatter all previous viewership records. Nicol found himself genuinely impressed by Chairman Lim Cheolho's quick thinking and creative vision.\n\n***\n\n『 D-Dragon... 』\n\n[The evil dragon Bunhelier has appeared!]\n\nThe notification blazed across every screen the instant shadows swallowed the sky. Commentators and viewers alike fell silent, utterly overwhelmed by the creature's sheer presence. The rational question—*Why is there a dragon in the National Competition?*—drowned beneath primal awe.\n\nKurarararara!\n\nBunhelier's massive jaws parted. The breath that poured forth resembled an ocean torn from its bed and hurled at the earth. Unlike a wyvern's breath—a flame that scorched mere meters—this blue torrent consumed everything in its path, an attack impossible to evade.\n\nKuwaaaaaaang!\n\nLion's Castle vanished so instantaneously that spectators questioned whether it had ever existed.\n\n\"...\"\n\nMillions of mouths hung open in stunned silence.\n\nDragons. Players recognized them as the ultimate endgame threat—legendary entities that made even the 1st Great Demon Baal look manageable. Fear rippled through the crowd like a living thing.\n\nThen—\n\n[You have suffered catastrophic damage!]\n\n[A legend doesn't die easily. Your life force is maintained at minimum. You resist all attacks for 5 seconds.]\n\nGrid, caught in Bunhelier's breath, triggered his immortal state. Simultaneously, Kraugel activated Freely Move, evading the torrent entirely as he soared toward Bunhelier's head—thirty meters above the battlefield. The skill let him designate any target within range and dash there, ignoring terrain.\n\n\"Condemnation Sword!\"\n\nCrack! Crackle!\n\nThe Sword Saint's ultimate technique—originally intended for Grid—manifested instead against the dragon. Silver energy wreathed his +9 White Fang as it plunged toward Bunhelier's scales.\n\n[The information of evil dragon Bunhelier has been released.]\n\n[Bunhelier]\nLevel: ????\nSpecies: Dragon\nStrength: 99,999 Stamina: 99,999\nAgility: 12,000 Intelligence: 25,000\nSkills: Breath (SSSS-rank), ????, ????, ????, ????, ????, ????, ????, ????, ????, ????, ????, ????.\n\n*A transcendent dragon. Should he desire it, he could destroy the world. Only a similarly transcendent existence poses any threat to dragonkind.*\n\n\"What the hell...?\"\n\nShock rippled through the spectators at those absurd statistics.\n\nThunk!\n\nDespite the ferocious momentum, Kraugel's blade pierced Bunhelier's hide. A single pupil—larger than Kraugel's entire body—regarded him with indifference. White Fang looked like a toothpick embedded in an elephant.\n\nThen:\n\n[Sword Saint Kraugel has dealt 1 damage to Bunhelier.]\n\nThe notification materialized on the central monitor for all to see.\n\n\"Ah... No way...\"\n\nReality crashed down on millions of viewers simultaneously. Kraugel—the sky above the sky, the man they all envied—was nothing more than an insect before this creature.\n\n『 That's... that's the world's strongest being...! 』\n\n『 A dragon... It's beyond anything we imagined. Could it even be raided in ten years? Twenty? 』\n\n『 Named bosses scale with player growth. Dragons don't. They were never designed to be raided in the first place. 』\n\nThe commentator spoke truth. Dragons existed outside the raid paradigm—Satisfy's foundational lore made that explicit.\n\nJust as despair began settling over the crowd—\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"What's he doing?\"\n\nCameras swiveled toward Grid. The purple fighting energy enveloping his body blazed brighter.\n\n\"100,000 Army.\"\n\n\"...Huh?\"\n\nMurmurs spread through the audience. Memories surfaced of that infamous video—*'Grid the Chunni.'* Was the Overgeared King seriously pulling theatrical nonsense right now?\n\n\"Is this a joke?\"\n\n\"What's he doing alone in this situation?\"\n\n\"He's lost his mind.\"\n\nSome viewers criticized Grid harshly. Others found it absurd. Then Grid spoke again:\n\n\"Massacre Sword.\"\n\nThe Undefeated King's legacy awakened.\n\nWhoosh!\n\nThud-thud-thud-thud-thud!\n\nThe Enlightenment Sword became a blur—thirty strikes per second. Black-red energy blades filled the air, a storm of killing intent converging on Bunhelier.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe instant Grid's technique connected, notifications flooded his vision:\n\n[The target is a dragon.]\n[The Hero King title effect is activated.]\n[The Hero King's fighting energy has risen to transcendent rank and threatens the dragon. Bunhelier's Absolute Defense has been disabled.]\n[You have dealt 1,500 damage to the target!]\n[You have dealt 1,430 damage to the target!]\n[You have dealt 1,610...]\n[You have dealt 1,290...]\n...\n...\n\nKuraaaaaaa!\n\nThe energy blade storm carved into Bunhelier! Scales that the Sword Saint's ultimate attack couldn't even scratch now bore visible wounds. Shock detonated across the global audience.\n\n\"Hic!\"\n\nSpectators began hiccupping involuntarily, their minds unable to process what they'd witnessed."
