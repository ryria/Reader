  "content": "**Peeeeeong!**\n\n\"—!\"\n\nThe explosion tore through the air. Alex's sniper rifle tracked Grid's movement, but Grid's lips curled into a grin.\n\n\"Not bad, right?\"\n\nDomestic affairs. Combat tactics. Even things that bored him senseless—Grid forced himself to study them all. Lauel handled most of the kingdom's bureaucracy, but Grid still pored over the reports, determined never to slide back into mediocrity. His intelligence stat remained stubbornly low, slowing his progress to a crawl. But slow progress was still progress. Keep trying. Keep improving.\n\nThat hunger—that *need* to be better than yesterday—had crystallized during his death match with Agnus.\n\n*Jiiiing.*\n\n**Pepepepeng!**\n\nVariables. When fighting someone stronger, you needed to throw them off balance. The **Alarm** spell had proven its worth against Agnus, so Grid had kept it in mind from the moment this battle began.\n\nAlex would retreat after experiencing **Link**'s devastating power—Grid was certain of that much. So he'd scattered **Alarm** spells along the projected escape routes. Not precisely, of course. Grid's tactical genius had limits. He'd compensated by carpet-bombing a wide area with magical tripwires, burning through mana like water.\n\n*'Only enough left for two more ultimate skills... wait—'*\n\nAdrenaline sharpened his thoughts. Every ranker knew this sensation—time dilating, decisions crystallizing with perfect clarity.\n\n\"**Pagma's Swordsmanship!**\"\n\nAlex held the sniper stance despite the **Alarm** detonating. Despite the **Magic Missiles** streaking toward him.\n\n**KUWAAAAAANG!**\n\nThe rifle discharged.\n\n\"**Revolve.**\"\n\nGrid activated his strongest defensive skill—a technique that *deflected all attacks*. \n\nIt meant nothing.\n\nThe magic engineering gun's sniper mode sacrificed firing speed for absolute accuracy. The \"guaranteed hit\" enchantment made evasion impossible. Like a real bullet, Grid's brain would register the sound only after the round had already torn through his skull.\n\nThe **God Hands** couldn't intercept in time.\n\n*Peeeeng!*\n\n\"...!\"\n\nJade light traced the bullet's path through Grid's forehead. The wet *crack* of splitting fruit. His head—his *head* was—\n\n> **[You have died!]**\n\n> **[A legend doesn't die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]**\n\n\"Ah...!\"\n\nCold sweat drenched him instantly, plastering his clothes to his skin. That sensation—his skull rupturing like overripe fruit—Grid's trembling hands flew to his head. Was he touching empty air? Would his fingers find pulped brain matter?\n\nNo. Whole. The entry wound had already sealed itself. Even the S.A. Group drew the line at displaying decapitated player corpses.\n\n\"Hah... hah...\"\n\nHis breath came in ragged gasps. Terror clawed up his throat. Five seconds of invulnerability—he should be *moving*, attacking, **doing something**—but two precious seconds bled away while he recovered from the psychological shock.\n\nAlex capitalized instantly.\n\n*Tang tang! Tatatatang!*\n\nConfirmed kill. The intruder was finished. Alex switched from sniper to pistol configuration and opened fire, each shot hammering into Grid's frozen form.\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Protect the Behen Archipelago from the great demons. Save humanity.*\n\nPagma's final command. The purpose burning at the core of Death Knight Alex's existence. He would fire until Grid's body disintegrated or his own frame collapsed—whichever came first.\n\n*Tatatatang!*\n\nTwo seconds of immortality remaining. Grid's avatar resembled a bullet-riddled training dummy. Alex had activated rapid-fire skills on pure instinct, pouring lead into the target without pause.\n\nThe barrage ignited something in Grid. Shock crystallized into white-hot fury.\n\n\"...You made me burn my immortality.\"\n\nWhich meant the next island would have to wait.\n\n\"Because of you, I'm grinding for another full day. **Blackening!**\"\n\n**KUWAAAAAANG!**\n\nDark wind erupted around him. His skin bleached to corpse-pale. The whites of his eyes inverted to tar-black. Even his breath misted out in shadowy wisps.\n\n> **[Your black magic power has increased.]**\n\n> **[You don't have any black magic power. It will be replaced with demonic power.]**\n\n> **[While Blackening is activated, your species will change to half-demon.]**\n\n> **[As a half-demon, your maximum health is reduced by 50%. Your attack power, magic power, and agility will increase by 30% each.]**\n\n> **[All attacks will be converted to the dark attribute.]**\n\nAlready immortal! Additional damage meant nothing. Blackening would end this fight—*had* to end it. But—\n\n> **[There is one second remaining on the immortality passive.]**\n\nOne second to eliminate two-thirds of Alex's health bar?\n\n\"**Blacksmith's Rage!**\"\n\n*Tang tang! Tatatatang!*\n\nGrid charged in a straight line, activating buffs mid-sprint. No dodging. No finesse. Just raw aggression as he closed the gap. Blackening's **agility** boost made him blindingly fast.\n\n\"**Item Transformation! Lifael's Spear!**\"\n\n*Kuooooooh!*\n\nThe **God Hands** shifted into golden spears, all four impaling Alex simultaneously.\n\n> **[The duration of immortality is over.]**\n\nHis health became mortal again.\n\n*Clink!*\n\nAlex's skull seemed to grin as the pistol swung toward Grid. The instantaneous death from the sniper round had bypassed **Tiramet's Belt** and the **First King** title entirely. One health point. One bullet. One—\n\n*'...He's calm?'*\n\nOn the 60th island, Sticks stared at the crystal ball in disbelief. Grid stood at death's threshold, facing an enemy at half health with a gun aimed between his eyes. Yet Grid's gaze remained steady. No trembling. No panic. Just... serenity.\n\n*'The one blessed by the gods.'*\n\nHumans crumbled before death. Every challenger who'd set foot on this archipelago had tasted despair in those final moments. Yet Grid looked almost... *bored*.\n\n*Taaang!*\n\nIn the crystal. Alex fired point-blank. Sticks and Bini both flinched, squeezing their eyes shut—expecting the feed to cut to Grid's death notification. But Grid refused to yield. Refused to despair.\n\nThe worst-case scenario?\n\n*'I've lived through worse a hundred times.'*\n\nHe'd made an old friend of rock bottom.\n\n*Taaang!*\n\nThe instant Alex's finger compressed the trigger—\n\n\"**Freely Move!**\"\n\nThe **Secret Hero** title skill. High-level dash ability with full attack immunity until reaching the designated target within two hundred meters.\n\n\"...!!\"\n\nPurple light flickered in Alex's eye sockets—confusion as four bullets fired from millimeters away somehow missed entirely, Grid's head weaving through impossible angles.\n\n\"*Heok*...!\"\n\nSticks gasped. Bini's wings froze mid-flap. The elf's hand flew to his chest, heart condition flaring. Then—\n\n> **[The option effect 'Ecstasy of Desire' has activated from the Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires!]**\n\n> **[Your attack power will increase by three times and your evasion by 99% for 20 seconds.]**\n\n> **[Your defense has become 0.]**\n\n*Teong!*\n\n**Freely Move** deposited Grid directly into Alex's guard. He shoulder-checked the death knight backwards, then pursued before Alex could recover his stance.\n\n\"**Pagma's Swordsmanship**...!\"\n\n**Pinnacle Kill**? Insufficient. Grid needed maximum damage output to exploit the Enlightenment Blade's 200% bonus. But **Pagma's Swordsmanship** suffered from brutal cooldown timers—**Link** was still locked.\n\nNo matter. He had something better.\n\n\"**Transcended Link.**\"\n\n\".....!\"\n\n*Kwa kwang! Ku kwa kwa kwa kwa! Ku kwa kwa kwa kwa!*\n\nPoint-blank maelstrom. Twenty energy blades detonated in sequence, shredding Alex from skull to pelvis.\n\n**KUWAAAAAAAAANG!**\n\nThe storm consumed him. The entire 62nd island convulsed—tremors violent enough to knock bystanders prone. Death Knight Alex's dark-attribute body absorbed some damage through passive healing, but—\n\n\"**KIYAAAAAAAAAAACK!**\"\n\nThe amplified buffs and **Ecstasy of Desire** bonus overwhelmed any recovery. Alex's scream dissolved into the energy cascade.\n\nThe 62nd island purified.\n\n> **[Death Knight Alex has been defeated!]**\n\n> **[You have succeeded in beating the 62nd island!]**\n\n> **[Alex's Magic Engineering Bayonet (Produced by Pagma) has been acquired!]**\n\n> **[Alex's Quick Gloves (Produced by Pagma) have been acquired!]**\n\n> **[As a reward for cleansing the island, you have gained one level!]**\n\n*Shaaaaaaah—*\n\nDivine light descended. Grass and wildflowers erupted across the barren stone, transforming desolation into meadow within seconds.\n\n\"Hah...\"\n\nGrid's smile carried equal parts relief and exhilaration. Sometimes you didn't need profound meaning—sometimes the game was just *fun*.\n\n\"Grid! Thank you, Grid!\"\n\nSticks sprinted toward him from the 60th island's shore, fairy Bini fluttering alongside. Watching the archipelago's gradual restoration kindled something in them both—dreams and hopes they'd thought long extinguished."
