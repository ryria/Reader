  "content": "\"Overgeared...?\"\n\nThe word hung in the air, unfamiliar to Sua and the other members of the Red Phoenix Group. Before they could puzzle it out, the fused armored needle let loose a howl.\n\n\"Kiyaaaaah~!\"\n\nHow many lives had this creature claimed with its overwhelming strength? Today, the roles were reversed. Grid was the hunter now. For a man aiming to stand at the summit of two billion users, this fused armored needle was nothing more than a walking experience cache.\n\n\"You're weak.\"\n\nGrid laughed at the monster. The fact that he'd been struck by silver thread earlier had already vanished from his mind.\n\n*Puk! Seokeok! Puk.*\n\nFailure carved through the armored needle's flesh, each strike punishing. The **20% bonus attack damage** in darkness elevated the **+9 Failure** to devastating levels.\n\n*Puhahahak!*\n\nBlood fountained from the fused armored needle's wounds. Grid had no intention of bathing in the corrosive spray. He dodged what he could and blocked the rest with the God Hands.\n\n*Chiiiik!*\n\nThe blood evaporated the instant it touched the golden constructs.\n\n\"Kukukuk!\"\n\nGrid's smile never wavered as he peered through the gaps between the golden fingers.\n\n*This game truly is about items.*\n\nThe armored needle, the silver thread—it was weaker than he'd expected, but think about it. What if he didn't have Lantier's Cloak? He would've taken several times the damage. The armored needle was formidable when wielding dozens of silver threads. It was only helpless before *him*.\n\n\"Kyaaaak!\"\n\nThe two armored needles—still connected by silver thread—roared and flexed. Muscles bulged. Then the silver threads lashed out again. Exactly **27 strands** twisted together, coiling into a drill that sought Grid's heart.\n\n*It's a remarkably flexible weapon.*\n\nA spider's web for defense, a drill for offense. The more he saw, the more insane it became. Greed filled Grid's chest. Just before the silver thread pierced him, he counterattacked.\n\n\"**Revolve**.\"\n\n*Jjeejeeeong!*\n\nThe timing was inevitable. Grid's control had sharpened dramatically after facing top rankers in the National Competition.\n\n*Peeok!*\n\nFailure reversed the silver thread's trajectory. The weapon plunged into the fused armored needle's skull.\n\n> [The double fused armored needle has been defeated.]\n> \n> [**259,504,141 experience** has been acquired.]\n> \n> [A **silver thread** has been acquired.]\n> \n> [Your level has risen.]\n> \n> [As someone with a **second class**, you will receive a level up bonus. **12 stat points** have been acquired.]\n> \n> [**Six points** have been forcibly invested into **intelligence** due to the influence of the second class, **Legendary Great Magician**.]\n\n\"Sigh...\"\n\nGrid checked his status. During the battle, it had been impossible to avoid every strike from the silver thread. But the enhanced defense and resistance of his items had largely neutralized the damage. Still, it hadn't been an easy fight. To defeat six armored needles, he'd summoned Randy, Noe, and the God Hands—burning through nearly every skill in his arsenal. It had taken everything he had.\n\nThanks to the level up, his **stamina** was fully restored. However, mentally, he was exhausted. He needed to rest while his skills came off cooldown. Sitting down, he opened his inventory to examine his loot: rotten leather, rotten bones, and other junk. Nothing of value except for two silver threads.\n\n> [**Silver Thread**]\n> \n> **Attack Power:** 100~????  \n> **Durability:** 1,000/1,000  \n> \n> Fragments of silver armor that have been shaped in the blood vessels of the armored needles for many years.\n> \n> Unlike ordinary silver thread that only has a thin coating of silver, this is made of pure silver. It also contains the powerful magic power of the armored needle.\n> \n> Depending on the skill level of the user, it can be used in various ways due to its different forms.\n> \n> * It is classified as a **secondary weapon**.\n> * **Conditions of Use:** Secondary Weapons Mastery Advanced Level 5. More than **2,000 dexterity**.\n> * The silver thread can be shot quickly if you have more than **2,000 dexterity**.\n> * If you have more than **2,500 dexterity**, you can twist **5 or less strands** of silver thread together to create the desired shape.\n> * If you have more than **3,000 dexterity**, you can twist **10 or less strands** of silver thread together to create the desired shape.\n> * If you have more than **4,000 dexterity**, the speed at which you can control the silver thread is doubled.\n> * If you have more than **4,000 dexterity**, you can twist **20 or less**...\n> ...  \n> ...  \n> * The silver thread can be used as a material for making items. However, a **craftsman level blacksmithing skill** is required.\n> \n> **Weight:** 5\n\nThe minimum damage was pathetically low, while the maximum seemed limitless. He'd seen what the fused armored needle could do by twisting **27 strands** together.\n\n*Amazing... but it's rare for anyone to learn Secondary Weapons Mastery, and the advanced level probably hasn't even appeared yet.*\n\nTen meters long. At this point, it was a secondary weapon that probably only Grid could use.\n\n*I need to raise my dexterity...*\n\nGrid grasped the two strands of silver thread between his fingers. Irene would be delighted if he gained more **dexterity**... Sua approached while he was deep in thought.\n\n\"Are your wounds all right?\"\n\nGrid laughed off her concern.\n\n\"As you can see, I'm fine.\"\n\nThe wounds from the silver thread were already healing. A tremendous recovery speed. Was it his high **stamina stat**? That was just the baseline. The real reason for Grid's rapid recovery was the God Hands—or more precisely, the effect of **Goddess Rebecca's Blessing** attached to the pavranium. The blessing increased Grid's health recovery rate by **300%**. It was a fundamental pillar of his strength.\n\n*This man...*\n\nSua's gaze toward Grid grew warmer. He hadn't lost his composure despite facing six armored needles, and his body was incredibly resilient. He was the blacksmith capable of restoring the Red Phoenix Bow, virtuous enough to earn the title **Pangea's Duke of Virtue**.\n\nShe couldn't help but feel favorable toward him. Not a crush, of course—pure respect. Sua was rational by nature.\n\n*Is he a daoist?*\n\n**Daoist.** A state of half-godhood that only those who cultivated daoism could reach. They were said to enjoy eternal life in Shangri-La and possessed mysterious powers. Perhaps Grid was a daoist.\n\n\"Hum hum.\"\n\nGrid suddenly coughed. His face reddened under the beautiful Sua's steady gaze. He glanced around, clearly trying to hide his embarrassment. Sua's conviction shifted when she saw that.\n\n*He's not a daoist.*\n\nA daoist wouldn't react like this. If Grid were a daoist, he wouldn't feel flustered by the opposite sex. Besides, Grid's power was overwhelming, yes, but it went beyond mysterious. He was something different from a daoist.\n\n*Different from the yangbans, too...*\n\nOf course Grid wasn't a yangban. Most people couldn't fathom this, but yangbans were trash who treated ordinary humans as insignificant insects. If Grid were a yangban, he would've stood by and watched as Sua and the Red Phoenix members died.\n\n*He wouldn't have wanted the silver thread if he were a yangban, either.*\n\nWhich meant Grid was an ordinary person.\n\n*A regular person... Ah.*\n\nLost in thought, Sua belatedly realized something. Grid was burdened by her stare.\n\n\"I was rude. I apologize.\"\n\nGrid waved his hand at the bowing woman.\n\n\"No need to apologize. Was the silver thread always this difficult to obtain?\"\n\nHe'd killed six armored needles and only gotten two strands. If he wanted to use it directly as a weapon—or as crafting material—he'd need to secure a large quantity. Sua belatedly noticed the silver thread in Grid's hands and gasped.\n\n\"You obtained silver thread...!?\"\n\nNormally, the material was nearly impossible to acquire. The moment armored needles died, the silver thread in their blood vessels corroded and vanished almost instantly. In the four years since Han Seokbong had organized the dungeon expedition, only seven silver threads had been recovered.\n\n\"You must be incredibly lucky to get two.\"\n\nSua's delight was palpable. Grid realized the drop rate was abysmal based on her reaction. He stood up.\n\n\"How large is this dungeon?\"\n\n\"We haven't been able to measure it. The Red Phoenix Group has never reached the depths.\"\n\nThe Red Phoenix Group wasn't as strong as Grid. They ventured into the dungeon every day but could only kill two or three armored needles at best.\n\n\"Our goal is to reach the end of the dungeon and investigate the cause behind the armored needles—then destroy them. But despite our intentions, we're at a standstill every day,\" Sua said quietly.\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Still, we have our pride. The residents of Pangea can enjoy a peaceful life because we stop the armored needles from advancing.\"\n\nBeautiful. Sua was lovely inside and out.\n\n*Though she is a bit of a pervert...*\n\nAt that moment—\n\n> [A quest has been created.]\n> \n> [**Subjugate the Armored Needles (1)**]\n> \n> **Difficulty:** S\n> \n> There are a large number of armored needles in the dungeon beneath Pangea Castle.\n> \n> Bring peace to Pangea by eliminating those who threaten it.\n> \n> **Quest Clear Conditions:** Kill 10 armored needles.  \n> **Quest Reward:** Affinity with the Red Phoenix Group will rise. Five silver thread.\n\n*The armored needles are strong.*\n\nGrid hadn't realized a monster hunting quest could be classified as **S-grade difficulty**. The armored needles were truly formidable. They had over **6 million health** and their defense was twice that of ordinary monsters. Add in their excellent swordsmanship, the unpredictability of the silver thread, and their corrosive blood as a weapon...\n\nGrid suspected an average level 300 player wouldn't stand a chance in a one-on-one fight with an armored needle. However, Grid was far stronger than armored needles.\n\n\"All right. I'll clear out as many armored needles as I can.\"\n\nHe had to claim that reward of five silver threads. Motivation burning, Grid started moving deeper into the cave. Then Sua cried out.\n\n\"Why are you putting yourself in danger by charging forward? Why struggle for other people?\"\n\nGrid shrugged at her sincere worry.\n\n\"I just want the silver thread. And I like you because you're pretty.\"\n\n\"...Ah?\"\n\nGrid had spoken bluntly, but the result was dramatic. Sua's face turned crimson. She was called the flower of Pangea—a woman unaffected when handsome men whispered sweet words in her ear. Yet she was *blushing*? Grid didn't realize what a big deal it was. He was already focused on the footsteps of approaching armored needles he could hear.\n\n*Starting now.*\n\n*Pahat!*\n\nGrid hurled the silver thread in the direction of the approaching monster. Shooting silver thread quickly was normally very difficult. For Grid, who had over **3,000 dexterity**, it was simple.\n\n*Pepeok!*\n\n\"Kyaaaak!\"\n\nThe armored needle shrieked as the silver thread pierced its flesh. It sped up its approach. Grid recovered the thread and shot it again.\n\n> [You have dealt **930 damage** to the target.]\n> \n> [You have dealt **370 damage** to the target.]\n\nThe damage was terrible—minimal numbers in the hundreds. The armored needle barely felt it. But Grid wasn't shaken. Throwing the silver thread didn't consume resources, so it wasn't a burden.\n\n*What if I twist them together?*\n\n*Sururuk.*\n\nGrid's hands moved at tremendous speed. The two strands of silver thread joined, becoming thicker with one pointed end.\n\n*...Isn't he good at this?*\n\nSua watched in wonder. That man—was there anything he couldn't do?\n\n*...Oh, he's good at everything?*\n\nHer thoughts wandered in a certain direction.\n\n*Peeok!*\n\nAs Sua's imagination headed somewhere strange, the arrow-shaped silver thread Grid shot dealt over **2,000 damage** to the armored needle.\n\n*Now I understand.*\n\nGrid was completely satisfied. He grew more and more desperate to secure a large quantity of silver thread. Swinging Failure, he launched himself at the armored needles."
