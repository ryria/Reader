Players who immersed themselves in books accumulated knowledge that translated into stat gains, sometimes stumbling upon hidden quests or rare skills tucked between the lines. Even without tangible rewards, the simple pleasure of discovery made it worthwhile.\n\nThe sheer volume of literature in Satisfy's vast world was staggering. Rumor spoke of a madman who did nothing but read during his sessions, yet even he had barely scratched the surface of the game's literary catalog.\n\nGrid, naturally, had never been part of this bookish crowd.\n\nReading required comprehension, patience—qualities that had never come easily to him. Books were obstacles, not opportunities. He'd avoided them instinctively, the way others avoided pain.\n\nUntil now.\n\n*[Death Knight Madra's Diary]*\n\nThe royal study of Overgeared Palace was quiet, sunlight filtering through tall windows. Grid sat at the reading table where Irene and Lord usually studied, the leather-bound volume resting before him like a challenge.\n\n'When was the last time I actually read something?'\n\nThe instruction manual for his diamond-class capsule. Last year. A gift from the Comet Group that he'd forced himself through, page by agonizing page, driven by an obsessive fear of missing some critical detail. Most people skipped manuals entirely, but Grid's anxiety about his own abilities had compelled him to read every word.\n\nHe didn't realize that made him unusual. He only knew that reading felt like labor—exhausting, uncomfortable work.\n\n\"The diary shouldn't be too complicated, right?\" Grid muttered, trying to convince himself.\n\nHe drew a long breath, centering his focus. This was just a diary. Personal thoughts. Nothing like a textbook.\n\n'I paid a million challenger points for this. Better be worth it.'\n\nTruthfully, his expectations were modest. The item's full name told the story: *Death Knight Madra's Diary*. Not the Undefeated King Madra. That single word changed everything. This was a journal written after Madra's resurrection as an undead, during his century of imprisonment on the island. What profound insights could come from a man trapped in a skeletal body, slowly losing himself?\n\nStill. He'd purchased it. Might as well read it.\n\nGrid opened the cover.\n\nThe moment the first page appeared, the words vanished.\n\nHis eyes slammed shut. The study disappeared. And suddenly, Grid wasn't Grid anymore.\n\n---\n\n**First Entry**\n\n*I opened my eyes, and the strangest thing was the silence in my chest.*\n\n*No heartbeat. No breath.*\n\n*I wasn't alive.*\n\n*I died—I remember that much. So how am I conscious? Why can I think?*\n\n*Wait. Thinking? The Undefeated King Madra, reduced to confusion? When did my mind become so... slow?*\n\n*Perhaps this is a dream. A nightmare. I never died at all, and soon I'll wake—*\n\n*No.*\n\nThe sound of bones rattling cut through the denial.\n\n*I lifted my hand to my face and saw it. Bone. White, bare bone. No blood pumping hot through my veins. No muscles that never tired. No flesh, no skin.*\n\n*Everything stripped away.*\n\n*The memories crashed back like a tidal wave—my son's blade in my heart, the beasts of Saharan tearing at my corpse, the bleak desert sands. I tried to process it all, but my skull felt too small, too empty to contain the torrent. Thoughts moved like sludge. The confusion wouldn't lift.*\n\nFootsteps.\n\n*A figure approached. Pale skin. Long black hair. Cold, narrow eyes that held no warmth—only calculation.*\n\n*I knew him.*\n\n*The legendary blacksmith. The Duke of Fire.*\n\n\"P...Pagma...\"\n\n*My voice emerged as a deep, rattling growl that echoed from somewhere in my chest cavity. The sound revolted me.*\n\nThe Duke of Fire bowed low, his expression unreadable.\n\n\"Undefeated King. Sacrifice yourself for the peace of the world.\"\n\n---\n\n**Back to Reality**\n\n\"Ugh!\"\n\nGrid gasped as the memory released him, catapulting him back into his own body. The chair scraped against the floor. His hands trembled violently.\n\nMadra's emotions lingered like poison—confusion, rage, grief, and a despair so profound it felt like drowning. Grid had lived it all from the inside. He'd felt the wrongness of bones where flesh should be, the horror of consciousness trapped in death.\n\n\"Kuoock... Kuhuk!\"\n\nHis legs gave out. Grid collapsed from the chair, hitting the floor hard. Tears streamed down his face unbidden.\n\nHe'd been betrayed. Cursed by the people he'd protected his entire life. Stabbed through the heart by his own son. Beheaded. Left to rot in the desert without even a coffin. And then—and then he'd opened his eyes to find himself a *thing*, a skeleton, a mockery of everything he'd been.\n\nDespair breeding despair.\n\n\"Pant... Pant...\"\n\n*Am I Grid? Or am I Madra?*\n\nThe confusion was absolute. Grid clutched his head, tears falling, his vision swimming red.\n\n**[★ WARNING ★]**\n\n**[You have assimilated with Madra's consciousness and experienced his memories directly. Severe psychological trauma detected. Your mental state is currently unstable.]**\n\n**[Status: Extreme Confusion]**\n\n**[System monitoring brain waves and pulse. If vital signs reach dangerous levels, Death Knight Madra's Diary will be forcibly sealed.]**\n\n\"Ku... no!\"\n\nImmersive virtual reality had its dangers—Grid had learned that lesson years ago during his first encounter with Huroi, when the game's intensity had nearly overwhelmed him. This wasn't his first system warning.\n\nBut he understood the risk was real this time. His heart hammered against his ribs. Sweat soaked his clothes.\n\nStill—he wouldn't quit.\n\nMadra had left something behind. Grid intended to claim it.\n\nHe forced his breathing to steady. Separated reality from the virtual. *I'm not Madra. I'm Grid. I'm Shin Youngwoo.*\n\n*Thump. Thump. Thump.*\n\nHis pulse slowed.\n\n**[Status effect removed: Confusion]**\n\n**[Vital signs normalized. Second entry of Death Knight Madra's Diary is now accessible.]**\n\n**[Continue reading?]**\n\n\"Of course!\" Grid's voice was hoarse, but determined.\n\nFear still coiled in his gut. The thought of diving back into Madra's nightmare made his hands shake. But Grid had learned long ago that giving up because something was hard meant living with regret forever.\n\nHe opened the second entry.\n\n---\n\n**Second Entry**\n\n\"Undefeated King. Sacrifice yourself for the peace of the world.\"\n\n*Pale skin. Black hair. Those cold, calculating eyes boring into me as the Duke of Fire bowed mockingly.*\n\n*Grid became Madra.*\n\n\"You want me to... sacrifice myself?\"\n\n*Fury. Pure, white-hot fury. I'd just been resurrected—against my will—only to be told I must give myself up again. No explanation. No choice. Just demands.*\n\n*Anxiety and fear bubbled up from somewhere deep in my skeletal frame, emotions I hadn't felt in decades.*\n\n\"It's been a long time since I've felt such anger.\"\n\n*I knew, instinctively, that I should hate this man. Pagma had done this. Pagma had brought me back. My bones shifted, and I realized with cold certainty: this undead form was my reality now.*\n\n\"Explain yourself. Now.\"\n\n*He must have a reason for resurrecting me. I needed to know what he meant by 'sacrifice' before I ripped his head off.*\n\nHis answer was absurd.\n\n\"The great demons are invading the Behen Archipelago. This place is the succession grounds, the Hall of Fame where legends pass their power to the next generation. If it falls to the demons, humanity has no future. You must defend it.\"\n\n\"The future... of humanity?\"\n\n*I didn't care about humanity. I cared about my people. My kingdom. Nothing else. That's why I'd become the Undefeated King—for them. Not for some abstract concept of humanity's future.*\n\n*My rage crystallized into something sharp and deadly.*\n\n\"I see. So that's why you've trapped me here—resurrected me as this *thing*? How dare you? How arrogant! How utterly contemptible! You've stolen my purpose, my duty! You deserve death a hundred times over!!\"\n\n---\n\n**Breaking Point**\n\nMadra's roar of fury echoed as he drew his sword—\n\nAnd Grid snapped back to reality, gasping.\n\nThe second memory ended abruptly. Grid's fingers still trembled with the phantom sensation of gripping a sword hilt with nothing but bone.\n\n'So vivid...'\n\nThe thought of becoming undead terrified him on a primal level.\n\n**[Your current abilities are insufficient to reproduce Madra's swordsmanship. You cannot read the remainder of the second entry.]**\n\nGrid blinked. \"...What?\"\n\n**[To continue reading this entry, you must first learn Madra's swordsmanship.]**\n\n**[Item acquired: Swordsmanship Textbook - 100,000 Army Swordsmanship]**\n\n**[Death Knight Madra's Diary sealed until learning requirement is fulfilled.]**\n\n\"What?!\"\n\nGrid stared at the notification in disbelief. Madra's swordsmanship? That was the reward?\n\n'Just for reading the second entry?!'\n\nHis hands shook as he opened his inventory, confirming the textbook's existence.\n\n**[Swordsmanship Textbook: 100,000 Army Swordsmanship]**  \n**Rating:** Legendary  \n\n*A manual recording the fundamental techniques of Madra's sword style. However, these are techniques used after Madra became a death knight—degraded versions significantly weaker than the originals.*\n\n*Contains two techniques: 100,000 Army Blockade Sword (Degraded) and 100,000 Army Massacre Sword (Degraded).*\n\n**Learning Requirement:** Must be recognized by Madra.\n\n\"Madra...!\"\n\nHeat surged through Grid's veins. Yes, in the diary, Madra had been hostile toward Pagma—but Grid didn't care. What mattered was that an overwhelmingly powerful warrior had acknowledged him. Had left him this legacy.\n\n\"I'll use what you've given me for the rest of my life,\" Grid whispered, clutching the textbook. \"I swear it.\"\n\nEver since witnessing Kraugel's power during the Great Demon Belial raid—watching the Sword Saint literally cut through reality despite still being relatively low-level—Grid had carried a quiet anxiety. Kraugel was ascending to heights Grid could barely comprehend. To keep pace, Grid would need to push himself harder than ever before.\n\nNow, he had a new path forward.\n\nGrid carefully closed Madra's diary, his expression resolute.\n\n\"I'll make sure the world knows the greatness of the Undefeated King.\"\n\nHe wasn't arrogant enough to claim he'd match Madra's original strength. But at the very least, he could honor the man's will. Carry his legacy forward.\n\n---\n\n**Meanwhile, in Lubana**\n\nThe Saharan Empire's territory of Lubana was in chaos.\n\n\"This is the Undefeated King's descendant? How pathetic.\"\n\nMercedes arrived at the battlefield, her blue eyes cold as winter ice. Below, the so-called descendant fought alongside his ragtag rebel army—majestic armor gleaming, knights and soldiers rallying around him.\n\nThey'd held out for weeks against the Empire's regular forces. An impressive feat, historically speaking.\n\nBut ultimately? Meaningless.\n\n\"The Undefeated King was nothing special in the first place. History simply exaggerated his accomplishments.\"\n\nMercedes' contempt was palpable, her words cutting through the air like a blade.\n\nIt was as if she stood atop Madra's grave, spitting on his memory."
