  "content": "Haster's pulse quickened. *At this exact moment?*\n\nHurent straightened, his exhaustion momentarily forgotten. *He actually showed up now?*\n\nThe timing couldn't have been worse—or better, depending on perspective. Haster had been poised to deliver the finishing blow to an exhausted opponent. Hurent had been ready to leverage his 'Developing into a Legend' title for a desperate comeback. Both men had tasted victory on their tongues.\n\nThen Grid appeared, and their carefully laid plans evaporated like morning dew.\n\nHaster's eyes narrowed. *This isn't coincidence.* The timing was too perfect, too surgical. Grid must have tracked his location through Asmophel and waited for precisely this moment—when Haster stood on the precipice of victory over an Aura Master. \n\n*He's keeping me in check.* A chill ran down Haster's spine. *This is how the truly powerful operate. Terrifying.*\n\nMeanwhile, Hurent's mind raced down an entirely different path. *Grid knew I was here?* \n\nOf course he did. Piaro served Grid—had surely reported everything. The Overgeared Kingdom belonged to Grid. Nothing happened within its borders without the king's knowledge. Including this fight. Including the damaged fields.\n\nHurent's chest tightened. *Is he angry about his fields?*\n\nNo. Something else made sense now. *He respects the work I've done under Piaro. He's showing me courtesy.*\n\nThe realization struck like lightning. Hurent had harbored resentment for years—nursed it like a flame. Grid had demolished him in five seconds during the National Competition. One of the world's strongest rankers, reduced to a laughing stock. He'd wandered aimlessly, drowning in depression, swearing vengeance.\n\nWhat a fool he'd been.\n\n*Grid knew I was working in his kingdom all along.* The pieces fell into place. *He knew I'd mature, knew I'd come for him eventually. But instead of casting me out, he watched. Waited. And the moment I faced real danger, he came.*\n\nGrid didn't cling to the past.\n\n*How vast is your heart?*\n\nOf course. There was a reason Piaro—the legendary farmer—served this man. Shame burned through Hurent's veins. All those wasted years, obsessing over revenge. Was that why Grid had avoided him? Because he knew? Grid must have known Hurent led the Eternal Kingdom's invasion of Reidan. Known everything. Forgiven everything. Watched in silence because he'd already forgiven.\n\nAnd when the fields suffered damage, Grid rushed to their defense.\n\nYet Hurent had wanted revenge.\n\n*Pathetic.* He clenched his fists. *If Grid's heart is an ocean, mine is a shallow well. I am insignificant.*\n\nThe truth crystallized, sharp and cutting. Hurent stood humbled, reshaped by sudden understanding.\n\n\"So.\"\n\nGrid's voice cut through the silence like a blade through silk.\n\n\"Who's paying for the damages?\"\n\nBoth men flinched.\n\nGrid surveyed the trampled crops with barely concealed irritation. His fields—destroyed by outsiders settling personal grudges! As king of the Overgeared Kingdom, he couldn't overlook this. He understood the blood and sweat poured into every furrow, every seedling.\n\n*I don't even know what Hurent's doing here. Or who this Haster is, really.*\n\nWhy they were fighting in his territory, why Piaro hadn't intervened—those questions could wait. First things first: someone owed him compensation.\n\n\"Obviously, he'll pay.\" Hurent pointed at Haster without hesitation. \"He damaged your field.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" Grid's lips pressed into a thin line.\n\nHe remembered Hurent from the 1st National Competition—the American who'd given him trouble during the target processing event. Despite the five-second victory, Grid had never underestimated him. Hurent possessed genuine strength. If he'd known about Pagma's Swordsmanship, Restraint beforehand, that fight could have gone very differently. Grid still recalled Hurent's insight, blocking swordsmanship and fixed damage aura with equal ease. The man had treated him like a child during their first encounter.\n\n*Now look at him. So respectful.*\n\nGrid's chest swelled slightly. He'd offered courtesy first, and the older man returned it in kind. The power of proper etiquette.\n\n\"I ruined the fields?\" Haster's face flushed crimson. \"By stepping on two buds?\"\n\n*This is absurd.* Hurent had been the one tearing through the crops during their duel. Hurent had attacked first based on a misunderstanding. Yet now he was deflecting blame?\n\n\"Hey, Grid.\" Haster's voice rose sharply. \"Act like a man. I've already figured out your game. You orchestrated this entire situation, didn't you?\"\n\nGrid's brow furrowed. *This bastard keeps talking down to me.*\n\nWhere Hurent offered bows and polite speech, Haster spewed accusations. The contrast couldn't have been starker. Grid's first impression of the man soured instantly.\n\n\"Fine.\" Grid exhaled through his nose. \"I'll get compensation from *you* then.\"\n\nAn entirely subjective judgment—but Grid had made his decision. Haster was clearly the root cause.\n\n\"Haster. You'll compensate me for invading the kingdom, disturbing the peace, and destroying property. And you'll apologize to the farmers who've been working hard.\"\n\n\"Still maintaining the act.\" Haster's jaw set, conviction hardening his features. *I was right. This is a trap.*\n\nEverything made sense now. Why would an Aura Master pretend to be a farmer unless it was planned? This was the Overgeared Kingdom—no coincidences here. Hurent disguised as a farmer, picking a fight—all orchestrated. Hurent must be an Overgeared Guild member following Grid's orders.\n\n*Testing me without lifting a finger.* \n\nThis was the power of a king.\n\nHaster retreated a step, shaken. \"Fine. I understand you now, Grid. Traveling with Asmophel is poisonous—I'll handle my class quests alone from now on.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n*What?* Grid blinked. *Why's he bringing up Asmophel?*\n\nBefore Grid could process this non-sequitur, Haster launched himself backward. His feet struck empty air in rapid succession—aerial acrobatics propelling him a meter with each impact. Within seconds, he'd escaped Grid and Hurent's immediate range.\n\n\"Hey!\" Grid's face darkened. \"Trying to run without paying? Arrest him!\"\n\nHaster scoffed mid-flight. *Arrest me? With what army?* \n\nOnly farmers worked these fields. No knights, no soldiers. Who could possibly catch him?\n\n*Grid, you've caught me off guard before. Never again.*\n\nHe'd prove he wouldn't bow, no matter what schemes—\n\n*\"Pillar of Fire!\"*\n\n*\"Conflagration!\"*\n\nTwin columns of flame erupted beneath him with a half-second delay. High-tier magic, executed flawlessly. The explosions hammered into Haster's already battered body from his fight with Hurent.\n\n*Kuk—!* \n\nOnly the time difference between casts saved him, giving him just enough window to activate Heroic Story. Simultaneous impacts would have killed him outright.\n\nHaster twisted mid-air, searching for the source.\n\n\"Gulp. He survived that?\"\n\n\"I'm still weak. Need more magic power.\"\n\nTwo farmers stood at field's edge, casually eating boiled potatoes.\n\n*Impossible!*\n\nHigh-level spells capable of killing him—cast by *farmers?* \n\n*Just like Hurent.* The pieces clicked together. *Grid disguised his guild's powerhouses as farmers.*\n\nTerror spiked through Haster's chest as he fled faster.\n\n*How many moves ahead does Grid see? What's his endgame?*\n\nGrid was nothing like Kraugel. Power, status, and absolute insanity combined into something far more dangerous. Fear burrowed deep into Haster's bones, taking root.\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid felt a heavy weight settle over him.\n\nNot from Haster's escape. From Hurent.\n\nThe middle-aged man was staring at him with sparkling, earnest eyes like an eager puppy. Grid shifted uncomfortably, struggling to comprehend what he was seeing.\n\n*What the hell is with this guy?*"
