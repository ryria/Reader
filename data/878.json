  "content": "Grid's pulse quickened. *I can use Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle more often.* The implications spiraled outward. If a four-fusion sword dance could rattle the gods, what devastation might six techniques unleashed in sequence achieve? Perhaps an evolution—Transcended Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle—a fusion skill beyond anything he'd pioneered.\n\nYet unease crept through his excitement. The four-fusion had provoked divine retaliation. The five-fusion had killed Yura in a single strike. Six would undoubtedly breach some fundamental limit of acceptable power. Would the system even recognize such a technique? Would the S.A Group permit it to exist?\n\nHe exhaled slowly. *Don't get ahead of yourself.* Most of his gains had come through chance, not design. The clone had proven the five-fusion existed—that alone was progress worth pursuing.\n\n*A five-fusion would make me exponentially stronger.*\n\nThe enhanced Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle gleamed in his mind. A cooldown reduced from three hours to thirty minutes transformed a trump card into a sustainable combat tool. What ultimate technique demanded three hours between uses? Attack skills needed responsiveness.\n\nHis thoughts veered. *Wait. Do I enhance an offensive skill at all?*\n\nPagma's Descendant was fundamentally a blacksmith class. Perhaps investing in production would yield greater returns. If the probability of creating myth-rated items increased—if he could equip an entire myth-rated set like the Enlightenment Sword—wouldn't raw equipment power eclipse even a five-fusion skill?\n\n*Overgeared.* The word tasted like destiny.\n\nItems formed the bedrock of any game. Skills amplified item strength. Superior equipment reduced incoming damage. The equation was simple. Grid pulled up the enhanced smithing skill description.\n\n**[Genuine - (Seeing the Gods' Techniques) Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship Skill Lv. 8]**\n\n**[The production button is now enabled, and the time required to craft items has been drastically reduced.**\n\n**A minimum of epic-rated items will be produced. High probability of unique-rated items. Certain probability of legendary-rated items. Under specific conditions, rare probability of myth reproduction or myth-rated items.**\n\n*** All production item stats increased by 30%.**\n\n*** When myth-rated items are produced, all stats permanently rise by +20 and continental reputation rises by +1,000.**\n\n*** Something special occurs with every three myth-rated items created. (Currently 2/3)**\n\n*** Enhanced skill fixed at master level.]**\n\nAir caught in Grid's throat. The *production button*—automation that other blacksmiths took for granted, now his. Dramatically reduced crafting time. A minimum epic rating on *everything* he forged. No more rare or normal garbage cluttering his output.\n\n*And the probabilities increased across the board.*\n\nBut the stat multiplier—that was the nuclear option. His current 21% bonus had been formidable. A longsword dealing 100 damage became 121 in his hands—effectively jumping a rating tier. Now 30%? A weapon with 2,000 attack power would gain an additional 600.\n\n*Plus twenty to all stats per myth item instead of ten.*\n\nSweat prickled his palms. The choice paralyzed him.\n\n*No. Think strategically.*\n\nThe Vatican had taught him the bitter limits of individual power. He was one person. One body. He couldn't be Hong Gildong, splitting himself across battlefields to save everyone. Enhancing blacksmithing would elevate his entire guild, his entire kingdom. Collective strength over personal glory.\n\n*But I'd still benefit.* Better items meant a stronger Grid. Just... not the explosive, immediate power spike of a perfected sword dance. That path required time. Resources. Luck.\n\nCrow's feet tightened at the corners of his eyes. Responsibility aged him faster than time—the weight of those he protected, those who depended on his choices.\n\n\"Ah, I'm sorry.\"\n\nGrid blinked. Damian stood patiently beside him, wearing an awkward smile.\n\n\"Why did you want to meet?\"\n\nDamian bowed. \"First—thank you.\"\n\n\"For?\"\n\n\"The Vatican quest. I know I might have cleared it without you.\" Damian's voice dropped. \"But Irene and Lord would have been at risk. If they'd died...\" He didn't finish. Didn't need to. The imagined scenario of Grid's rampage hung unspoken between them. The cute student who'd become so precious—just *thinking* about Lord's death carved a hollow in Damian's chest.\n\n\"I have a problem.\"\n\n\"A problem?\" Grid frowned. The Yatan members were dead or captured. What remained?\n\nDamian drew a blade from his inventory—radiant gold, humming with subdued power. The first holy sword.\n\n\"Ah!\" The exclamation escaped before Grid could stop it.\n\nEven Pagma's accumulated knowledge offered no answers. The material defied identification—not gold, not adamantium, not pavranium. Glass-like in appearance, it rang with crystal clarity when struck. Fragile-seeming. Yet Grid had witnessed its edge cleave through corrupted flesh. Beneath the delicate surface lurked something harder and sharper than appearances suggested.\n\n\"What's wrong with—\" Grid noticed the grey spots marring the blade's surface. He rubbed one. Rough texture, like stone.\n\nPetrification.\n\n\"The curse is returning,\" Damian said quietly. \"If it continues, the holy sword will be sealed in the Stone of Original Sin. Its divine power will be extinguished.\"\n\n\"The Stone of Original Sin?\"\n\n\"A curse forged by the seven malignant saints—those who sought to drag gods to earth and ascend in their place. It neutralizes *all* divine power. A corrupted force that denies divinity itself.\"\n\n*Corrupted?* Grid's instincts bristled. His suspicions about the relationship between the gods and the seven malignant saints ran deeper than Damian knew. But challenging the Pope's absolute faith in Goddess Rebecca here, now—without evidence—would only sow chaos.\n\n*Not yet. I put Damian in this position.*\n\nHe swallowed the doubts rising in his throat.\n\nDamian's expression shifted. \"I received a divine message.\"\n\nHe extended the sword. \"Please make the first holy sword complete.\"\n\n**>Ding!**\n\n**>[The new quest 'Cleanse the First Holy Sword' has been generated.]**\n\n**>[Cleanse the First Holy Sword]**\n\n**>[Difficulty: Class Quest**\n\n**Your blacksmithing skills have reached the realm of gods.**\n\n**Prove it to the divine.**\n\n**Your craftsmanship now rivals Pagma himself.**\n\n**Completely cleanse the First Holy Sword and step out from his shadow!**\n\n**Quest Clear Conditions: Cleanse the First Holy Sword**\n\n**Quest Clear Reward: Unlock new Pagma story fragment, new Pagma's Swordsmanship technique, Goddess' Blessing]**\n\nGrid's breath stopped. A new sword dance. Years since he'd learned one. *Years.*\n\nHis heart hammered against his ribs, pulse thundering in his ears. And that last line—the goddess' blessing.\n\n*Both. I could enhance both.*\n\n***\n\n(\"Is the light so bright you must shut your eyes? A half-god proves no better than the blind.\"\n\nThe Clown King's bitter smile seemed to sympathize with the seven good people.)\n\nKraugel's expression remained placid as he studied the stone slab. Beside him, Kusar trembled.\n\n\"C-Clown? Seven *good* people? This is sophistry! Manipulation!\" The pilgrim's voice cracked. \"A wicked trick to drive a wedge between future generations and the gods!\"\n\nKusar had traveled the continent seeking truth about divine nature. This slab contradicted everything—branded the seven malignant saints as virtuous. Unthinkable. The person who'd recorded the Clown King's era must have been corrupted.\n\n\"Put it down! A great demon mocks us from the shadows!\" Kusar turned away violently, denial blazing across his features.\n\n*This is it.* Kraugel's black hair shifted as he continued examining the slab, undisturbed by revelations that shattered conventional history.\n\nA certainty crystallized. *Grid. Haster. Agnus. Me. Soon, we'll converge.*\n\nSome would champion righteousness. Others would embrace darkness.\n\nBehind Kraugel's shoulders, a phantom wing flickered—white bleeding into black, black bleeding into white.\n\nGrid, Agnus, Haster—all had claimed power from the seven malignant saints.\n\n\"You're a great demon!\" Kusar's shriek echoed off stone.\n\n\"No.\" Kraugel's voice was soft. \"We don't know that yet.\""
