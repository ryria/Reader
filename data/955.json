  "content": "[The North Gate Guardian has fallen.]\n\n[The scattered gray soul is saying sorry to you.]\n\n[The North Gate has been breached! The momentum of the invaders is soaring into the sky!]\n\n\"Unexpected.\"\n\nGrid's fingers paused over the Reputation Store interface. The first gate breached in thirty-seven minutes—that aligned with his projections. What *didn't* align was which guardian had fallen first.\n\nNoll. The North Gate. The strongest defensive position.\n\n*I was certain he'd last the longest.*\n\nGrid had crafted Valhalla of Strong Trust specifically for this event—myth-rated armor modeled after Valhalla of Infinite Affection. Multiple opponents meant increased health regeneration, reduced incoming damage, and stacking defense bonuses up to one hundred points. By every metric, Noll should have been the most durable of the four guardians.\n\n*Even with the title's survival instinct...*\n\nThe clone possessed Noll's title effect—a forced retreat trigger when health dropped below ten percent. That failsafe hadn't been enough.\n\nGrid's jaw tightened. \"Magic Missile.\" \n\nOnce Alarm's cooldown refreshed, he withdrew Belial's Staff and began configuring the spell's timing. His hands moved through the familiar motions, but his mind worked backward through the problem.\n\n\"Immobile Fortress became a liability.\"\n\nThe passive attached to Valhalla of Strong Trust. Every time the armor's durability dropped past certain thresholds, it triggered damage reflection—a powerful defensive tool in specific circumstances. But that power came with a fatal cost: the wearer couldn't move while the effect was active.\n\n*That's what killed him.*\n\nAdd Jishuka to the equation. Few players possessed attack power threatening enough to genuinely endanger Noll, and fewer still could maintain *sustained* high damage output. Jishuka was one of them. If Damian had granted her wings through his buffs, allowing her to rain arrows from above while Noll stood frozen by his own armor...\n\nThe timeline made sense now.\n\n\"Alarm. Magic Missile.\" \n\nGrid set up another spell sequence, then returned his attention to the Reputation Store. His pulse remained steady despite Noll's death. The notification claiming the fallen guardian was 'sorry' registered as white noise.\n\n*Because it's not real.*\n\nThe operating team had programmed an apology into the death message. They didn't understand Noll's nature. The real Noll—young, dependent, still learning his place in the world—wouldn't feel sorry at the moment of death. He'd feel *betrayed*. Where was Grid? Why hadn't Grid saved him from that humiliation?\n\nThe four guardians inherited only statistical power and combat patterns. Not personalities. Not true thoughts.\n\nFeeling grief for artificial constructs was irrational.\n\n*Stop it. They're not real.*\n\nGrid focused on controlling his breathing, his heartbeat. \n\nIt didn't work.\n\nAnger simmered beneath his sternum—thick and viscous, impossible to purge. Not anger at the players who'd breached the gate. Anger at himself. Noll's premature defeat traced directly back to an item *Grid had made*. An item designed to protect that had instead created a fatal opening.\n\n*Fool.*\n\nPlayers respawned. NPCs didn't. Their lives were finite, irreplaceable. Grid had sworn to value that—to guard them with everything he had.\n\n*I can't do this halfway.*\n\nThe real Noll was currently standing guard at the vampire city. What if invaders targeted that location while Grid was absent? What if Noll trusted the armor Grid had forged for him? What if that trust—Grid's own craftsmanship—became the weapon that killed him?\n\n\"Not again...\" \n\nHis right hand trembled around the hammer. Knuckles white. Khan's face surfaced in his memory—\n\n[The South Gate Guardian has fallen into the moat.]\n\n[The scattered gray soul melting in the water is saying sorry to you.]\n\n[The South Gate has been breached! The roar of the invaders has penetrated the battlefield!]\n\nNine minutes after the North Gate. The second casualty: Vin, Asmophel's clone.\n\nGrid didn't flinch. Asmophel's path had been paved with sin and guilt since the Red Knights. He'd forged himself through confrontation with crimes he could never escape. Lately, his swordsmanship had begun transcending conventional limitations of speed and reaction time.\n\n*But he's not there yet.*\n\nCompared to the other guardians, Asmophel remained incomplete. He wasn't a legend like Piaro or Mercedes. He lacked Noll's natural-born supremacy. The flames of his sword techniques burned his own body as readily as his enemies'. Still short of true transcendence, fighting one hundred rankers with stats reduced by thirty percent—\n\nThe outcome had been inevitable.\n\n[The price of the selected item is 999 reputation points. Do you want to buy it?]\n\nThree months. That's how long Grid had between accepting the Demon King Project and today. He'd spent every moment calculating variables, running scenarios, optimizing odds. Quests. Adventures. Equipment enhancements for the four guardians. Strategic planning for efficient resource deployment.\n\nOne strategy: maximize the Reputation Store.\n\nThe store's inventory was vast—consumables, elixirs, skill enhancement scrolls, magic scrolls, mystery boxes containing random items, pet boxes, minerals, jewels, ingredient bundles. High prices guaranteed minimum quality thresholds.\n\nOriginally, Grid had planned to purchase Sweet Candy—a buff granting thirty percent to all stats for five minutes. Five purchases meant twenty-five minutes of peak performance. Simple. Reliable.\n\nBut after further analysis, he'd identified a better option.\n\nThe cheapest item in the entire store: the 999 reputation point random draw.\n\n[Draw! Draw! Draw it!]\n\n[The random drawing machine!\n\nIf you spend 999 reputation points here, you can get a variety of items from the store at a random cheap price!\n\n* Limited edition items aren't included.\n\n* There is a certain probability of acquiring experience increase potions.\n\nPrice: 999 reputation points.]\n\nThe description promised \"various items sold at a random price\"—marketing language designed to obscure the actual mechanics. But Grid remembered. He'd used this machine before and received a Pretty Hairpin and Most Delicious Skewers in the World alongside the expected experience buff potion.\n\nThose skewers hadn't appeared anywhere in the Reputation Store's regular catalog. Yet they'd come from the machine.\n\nPast Grid had dismissed it as trash luck. Present Grid recognized the pattern.\n\n*The machine draws from every shop in the world.*\n\nEvery merchant. Every hidden vendor. Every secret store tucked away in forgotten corners of the game. The alternative explanation—that it was a bug—held no water. Satisfy didn't have bugs. Only intentionally cruel game design.\n\n\"Confirm.\"\n\nThe probability of drawing premium items was undoubtedly abysmal. Buying guaranteed buffs would be safer. But safety meant passing up potential jackpots, and Grid's good luck stat now sat at 631 points.\n\n*I could be the King of Luck with numbers like that.*\n\nThe Challenger Store on Fog Island sold elite-tier elixirs, skills, and scrolls. Dozens of similar hidden merchants existed across the game world—vendors Grid hadn't discovered yet, stocking items beyond current imagination.\n\n*If I hit even a few good pulls...*\n\nThis was the test run. Reputation points were scarce in actual gameplay, making experimentation prohibitively expensive. But here, during the competition, he could commit fully to the random draw. If the results disappointed, his other preparations would carry him through the Demon King performance adequately.\n\nGrid pressed the button.\n\n[999 reputation points have been consumed to buy the 'Draw! Draw! Draw it!' item. You have 219,540 reputation points remaining.]\n\n[...!!!]\n\n[Your high good luck stat has brought about a positive result!]\n\n[The Immediate Item Completion Scroll has been acquired!]\n\n\"...\"\n\nWhat?\n\nGrid blinked at the notification. Read it again to confirm he hadn't hallucinated the text.\n\n\"...Ah.\"\n\nMaybe he should stop here. Buy the candies and magic scrolls instead.\n\nDespite his earlier conviction, the thought felt genuinely tempting.\n\n***\n\n『 After a long struggle—! A truly fierce struggle—finally...!! 』\n\n『 The four hundred players have breached all four gates! 』\n\n『 The cooperation between players transcending nationality was beautiful and inspiring! 』\n\n『 Thanks to Satisfy, humanity is one! Magnificent! 』\n\nCommentators across every broadcasting nation spoke with feverish excitement. Global audiences erupted in celebration. One hour and forty minutes—two full challenge attempts—of brutal, desperate, glorious combat. The journey would be seared into collective memory for years.\n\n『 Now only the Demon King remains! 』\n\n『 The Demon King... truly formidable. After witnessing his surprise appearance event, I couldn't imagine him falling to anyone. 』\n\n『 I felt the same. But things have changed. 』\n\n『 Yes! Our heroes have learned to work together. They're no longer rivals—they're companions who trust and rely on each other! 』\n\n『 Exactly! Four hundred heroes united can defeat even the mighty Demon King! 』\n\nThe commentators couldn't contain themselves. To them—to everyone watching—the four hundred players on stage were genuine heroes. The crowd in the stadium and billions watching worldwide shared that sentiment. Rankers: the handful of geniuses among two billion players. Objects of envy and aspiration.\n\nPeople believed the propaganda. They prayed for victory. The Demon King was just an AI—they couldn't bear watching their national representatives humiliated by programmed monsters.\n\n[Breaking through all the gates has opened the way to the Demon King's castle.]\n\nKraugel. Chris. Jishuka. Damian. Zibal. Haster. Peak Sword. The four hundred followed the most prominent figures through the passage. At the end, a massive door stood open. They passed through into a great hall.\n\n\"...\"\n\nNo one charged forward.\n\nMusic echoed from deep within the darkness—a music box playing an instrumental piece designed to heighten tension and unease.\n\n\"Everyone cooperate.\" Chris's voice cut through the mounting anxiety. \"Maintain a tight, compact formation. Tanks on the perimeter with shields raised. Mages inside casting defensive spells.\"\n\nChris had identified the Demon King. He understood how critical proper preparation would be. As one of the Ten Meritorious Retainers, he was intimately familiar with Grid's large-scale bombardment tactics using the Alarm spell.\n\n\"Listen to Chris.\"\n\n\"Close formation?\" someone grumbled. \"This isn't a real war.\"\n\nBut most players complied. Following Chris's orders during the guardian fights had produced results. Now was the time for cooperation, not solo plays. The Demon King would inevitably be stronger than any individual guardian.\n\nGoshar, a mage, reinforced the message: \"He's resistant to magic. Like Chris said—focus on defensive spells and rack up contribution points. Who knows? Stay alive, protect others, you might win gold.\"\n\n\"Going for gold without pulling your weight seems cheap.\"\n\n\"Y-You're right.\"\n\n\"Haha!\"\n\nThe atmosphere lightened. The oppressive music lost its grip. Determined expressions replaced nervous tension. Deep breaths. Slow, measured advance while maintaining formation integrity. Mages cast light spells. The darkness retreated.\n\n\"You're late.\"\n\nA massive organ dominated the far end of the hall. Beside it stood the Demon King.\n\n[The Demon King has appeared.]\n\nBrief notification. Immense weight.\n\n\"Shields!\" Chris barked, anticipating an opening salvo. Tanks snapped shields into position.\n\n*BOOM.*\n\nThe sound obliterated thought. Artillery shells punched through magical barriers and crushed physical shields like paper.\n\n\"A *cannon*?\"\n\n\"Gah—! Hold formation!\"\n\n\"Get up! Raise those shields!!\"\n\nThe attack's form and power exceeded all expectations. Dust clouds erupted. Players staggered, disoriented.\n\nTwo seconds. Three at most.\n\nEnough time.\n\nThe Demon King exploded through the chaos, slipping past ranged attackers, closing directly on Seuron of Argentina. Seuron—who'd claimed in a pre-competition interview that Grid had hemorrhoids.\n\n*This bastard?*\n\nWas he... smiling? Seuron read the expression behind the mask and felt ice flood his veins.\n\n\"Death Penalty.\"\n\nThe Demon King's voice carried the finality of a tombstone inscription.\n\nSeuron couldn't identify whether the weapon piercing his chest was sword or spear. Only that it was there, and he was dying.\n\n\"...\"\n\nBeyond the pillar of gray light marking Seuron's deletion, red energy pulsed around the Demon King. The assembled players couldn't bring themselves to look directly at it."
