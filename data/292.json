You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]\n\nGrid's health bar evaporated. At level 200, each point of strength granted five health, each point of stamina twenty. Combined with the 6,000 health from the <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Holy Light Set</span> and the 3,000 from his Man who has Touched Hell title, Grid possessed over 55,000 total health.\n\nSix thousand points more than Vantner, the tank. The highest health pool of any user among two billion players.\n\nAnd Elfin Stone had annihilated it all in a single strike. Even with the <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Holy Light Armor</span> cutting magic damage in half, the vampire earl's ultimate skill lived up to its name.\n\nA blow of death.\n\nGrid screamed. \"Kuaaaak! That crazy bastard!\"\n\nHis immortal passive cooldown expired. He died instantly. Again. Grid clawed at his hair, stomped his feet like a child denied dessert. Meanwhile, the Overgeared members were practically glowing.\n\nJishuka ticked points off on her fingers. \"Elfin Stone's re-emergence cycle is 24 hours.\"\n\n\"Elfin Stone attacks the person with the highest stats,\" Lauel added, already scribbling notes.\n\nVantner grinned. \"Elfin Stone is arrogant. Didn't even notice Grid survived.\"\n\nPon nodded slowly. \"He'll keep attacking Grid every time he appears.\"\n\n\"Which means,\" Zednos said, \"the rest of us are safe until Grid hits level 300.\"\n\n\"We can prepare perfectly for the real fight.\"\n\nGrid turned to stare at his beaming guildmates. His eye twitched.\n\nVirtual reality's greatest strength was perfect sensory immersion. But in combat, that strength became a curse. When an enemy struck you, it *hurt*. Not your imagination. Real pain transmitted through the capsule's neural interface.\n\nTaking massive damage in one blow felt like getting hit by a truck.\n\n*I have to endure this for five more days?*\n\nGrid looked at his laughing colleagues. At their relieved faces. He swallowed his complaints. They weren't wrong. This *was* ideal for the group's survival.\n\nGrid forced his jaw to unclench. \"Let's move on to the next building.\"\n\nThe sooner he reached level 300, the sooner Elfin Stone's ultimate skill would stop one-shotting him. Grid marched ahead. The party followed into the third building. Two structures already cleared meant their coordination had evolved. Vampire hunting had become routine.\n\nGrid's experience bar climbed steadily.\n\n***\n\n\"Finally. Sleep.\"\n\nElfin Stone returned to his mansion, already anticipating tomorrow's visit. Those pathetic humans would be trembling, desperate, breaking under the psychological torture. He changed into silk pajamas, placed a nightcap on his head, and slid into his white coffin.\n\n*Kukuk. They must be begging for death right now.* Elfin Stone smiled into the darkness. *But I won't grant that mercy. Slowly... one by one... Hrmm.*\n\nDrowsiness crashed over him like a wave. The Curse of Idleness affected all vampires, but strength amplified the affliction. Common vampires slept twenty hours a day. A vampire earl? Twenty-three hours minimum. Sometimes a full year without waking.\n\nElfin Stone's breathing slowed. Within seconds, he was unconscious.\n\n***\n\nAshley Tosun, 8th Development Team Leader at S.A. Group, was one of the thirty-three scientists who built Satisfy's virtual reality system alongside Lim Cheolho. Within the company, they called him the Father of Vampires.\n\nHe'd designed every vampire in the game, including Elfin Stone. The earl's behavior pattern was elegant in its brutality. When invaders threatened his city, Elfin Stone would hunt the strongest party member once every 24 hours for seven consecutive days. By the seventh death, any organized raid would collapse into chaos and rout.\n\nExcept...\n\n\"This is insane.\" Ashley stared at his monitor.\n\nThe 13th Vampire City ranked among the highest difficulty dungeons in Satisfy. When Grid's party entered, Ashley had dismissed them immediately. Standard wipe scenario. Players get overconfident, vampire lord murders them, repeat.\n\nBut now doubt crept in.\n\nGrid's immortal passive completely negated Elfin Stone's assassination mechanic. The vampire earl couldn't distinguish individual power levels. He simply locked onto the highest combined stats and attacked that target every time he manifested.\n\n\"This shouldn't be possible...\"\n\nThe fundamental problem was Grid himself. His attack power, defense, and magic power all exceeded his party members by a wide margin. Pagma's Descendant wasn't *supposed* to develop this way.\n\nThe class's design philosophy revolved around a tipping point. After crafting five legendary items, stat growth would gradually decline, combat effectiveness would plateau, and the player would naturally transition toward a production-focused role. Grid's terrible luck had delayed that milestone for months.\n\nAn unforeseen variable. The prolonged growth period resulted in absurdly inflated stats. Those inflated stats enabled successful raids. Successful raids generated more growth. A feedback loop the development team never anticipated.\n\n\"He might actually collect all the pieces...\"\n\nInterest flickered across Ashley's face. Following Lim Cheolho and Director Yoon, Grid had claimed another fan at S.A. Group.\n\n***\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nThe third building fell. The loot distribution began immediately.\n\nNo elixirs dropped. No spellbooks. But one vampire ring materialized in Pon's inventory, pulled from a junior vampire's corpse. Lower rarity than they'd hoped, but infinitely better than nothing.\n\nAfter brief discussion, they awarded the ring to Peak Sword. As the party's primary damage dealer, he'd maximize the lifesteal effect.\n\nPeak Sword slipped the ring onto his finger. \"This changes everything...\"\n\nHis confidence wasn't misplaced. Joining Overgeared had been the best decision of his career. Peak Sword's battlefield endurance had skyrocketed.\n\nHidden Sword was a class built on a fatal flaw. Both normal attacks and skills required drawing the blade from its sheath. The animation delay left him vulnerable. Exposed. But when that blade finally emerged...\n\nNothing survived the draw.\n\nNow vampires learned that lesson.\n\n\"Kuak!\"\n\n\"These humans...!\"\n\nThe fourth building resembled a cathedral. Long wooden benches stretched toward an altar. Coffins filled every gap between the pews, a macabre congregation frozen in rest.\n\nPeak Sword vaulted over a bench. His hand moved.\n\n*Taack!*\n\nSteel whispered free of leather.\n\n*Seokeok!*\n\nLight flashed. Blood erupted from a vampire's chest before the creature registered danger. Invisible. Instantaneous. Indefensible.\n\n*Jjejeong! Jjang!*\n\nPeak Sword gave no openings. His sheath remained in his left hand, functioning as shield and parry tool. He deflected vampire claws, blocked blood magic, all while his right hand returned the blade to rest. The vampire ring pulsed with each successful hit, siphoning stolen vitality back into his body.\n\nHis health never dropped below ninety percent.\n\nThe fourth building cleared faster than the third. Grid hit level 299. His experience gauge would reach roughly twenty percent after the next structure.\n\n*Just a bit longer.* Grid's hands curled into fists. *The third stat awakening. Then I'll crush that arrogant bastard.*\n\nA notification materialized.\n\n> [The cooldown time of title skill 'One who Became a Legend' is over.]\n\nGrid's stomach dropped. \"Damn.\"\n\nHe braced for impact. A blond figure appeared directly overhead.\n\nElfin Stone smiled. \"Didn't I say I would return?\"\n\n\"*Puhahahak!*\"\n\nRed light consumed everything. Grid's health deleted. Elfin Stone threw his head back and laughed.\n\n\"I'll be back soon! Another will die. Then another. Again and again! I'll teach you the true meaning of fear and...\" The vampire earl trailed off. His eyes swept across the party.\n\n*Wait.*\n\n'The numbers are the same as yesterday?'\n\nNine people yesterday. He'd killed one, which meant eight should remain. But thinking back to the first day, hadn't there been nine then too?\n\n'I'm mistaken.'\n\nElfin Stone's smile returned. No human survived Extreme Blood Transfusion. Impossible. They must have started with eleven. His skill was absolute. He trusted that over fuzzy memory.\n\n\"Until next time, then.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Tomorrow, you idiot.* Grid wanted to scream the correction at the vampire's back. *Not 'soon.' Tomorrow.*\n\nThe party exchanged glances after Elfin Stone vanished. Their unspoken consensus: vampire earls were monumentally stupid.\n\nIn truth, Elfin Stone's intelligence wasn't deficient. He simply slept twenty-three hours daily, conscious only during brief feeding windows. Remembering exact headcounts of prey? Why bother? Humans were food. You didn't memorize how many grapes sat in a bowl.\n\n\"Damn bastard...\" Grid muttered.\n\nHis equipment durability was critical. Time for maintenance.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nThe legendary blacksmith pulled out his hammer and anvil, repairing items in the field. His party members watched with naked envy.\n\nOrdinary users needed expensive Repair Tool Sets for mid-dungeon maintenance. Grid just pulled out a hammer. Fixed everything for free. Even accumulated skill proficiency in the process.\n\nGrid hammered a dent from his chestplate. *Just wait, Elfin Stone. I'll repay this humiliation tenfold.*\n\n***\n\n> [The duration of the Experience Increase Potion is over.]\n\n\"Ah, damn it.\"\n\nThe seventh building had just fallen. Grid's experience gauge sat below fifty percent. The potion's expiration was catastrophic timing.\n\n*Three more buildings minimum.* Grid's jaw clenched. *Maybe four.*\n\nAt level 299, the experience requirement had quadrupled. He needed to kill vampires non-stop. No breaks. No rest.\n\nElfin Stone manifested above Grid's head.\n\nThe fourth visit. But something was different. The vampire earl didn't attack immediately. He stared at Grid, head tilted.\n\nThe party tensed.\n\n*Is he onto us?* Jishuka's hand moved toward her bow.\n\nElfin Stone's eyes narrowed. \"You. Why are you still alive?\"\n\n\"...!\"\n\nGrid's blood turned to ice. The worst-case scenario. Elfin Stone had noticed. The assassination pattern would break. He'd slaughter the entire party.\n\n*I'm not level 300 yet!* Panic clawed at Grid's throat.\n\nNo choice. They had to fight now.\n\n*We'll just have to deal with it.* Grid's hand moved toward his pet summoning command. Noe and Randy would buy them seconds at most, but seconds might be enough to—\n\n\"Your parents must've had a hard time after giving birth to you!\"\n\n\"W-What...?\"\n\nHuroi stepped forward, pointing dramatically at the vampire earl.\n\nElfin Stone's handsome face twisted into an expression of profound shock.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**  \n**OG:** Glossary Link.  \n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
