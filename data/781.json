  "content": "# A Blacksmith's Paradise\n\nPanmir strode through the capital gates, heart racing. The #1 ranked blacksmith had seen workshops from the Empire to the dwarven halls of Talima, but nothing—*nothing*—compared to this.\n\nThe smithy complex sprawled before him like a living beast. Hammers rang in constant percussion, a symphony of metal on metal echoing from every quarter. Smoke billowed from dozens of chimneys, painting the sky in shades of grey and amber. The air itself shimmered with heat, thick with the scent of molten steel.\n\n\"Incredible.\" He stood rooted to the cobblestones. \"This is what a blacksmith builds when he becomes a king.\"\n\nThe rational design struck him immediately—each forge positioned to maximize airflow, the cooling stations strategically placed between anvils, the ore storage connected directly to smelting zones. Every element served a purpose. Grid had clearly poured his heart into this place.\n\n*If I work here,* Panmir thought, excitement bubbling up from his chest, *my efficiency will skyrocket.*\n\nHe toured building after building, admiring the craftsmanship. By the time he reached the first smithy—his future workplace—his steps felt weightless.\n\n\"Make way!\"\n\nPanmir paused mid-stride, humming dying on his lips. He turned.\n\nA line of figures shuffled down the street, bent double beneath massive flour sacks. The bags had to weigh over a hundred kilograms each. Sweat carved rivers through the dirt caking their faces. Their gait reminded him of ducks waddling through mud.\n\nOne man stumbled. His knees buckled, and he crashed to the ground with a meaty *thud*. Before anyone could move to help, he scrambled upright—almost frantic—and lurched back into formation.\n\nPanmir's brow furrowed. \"Harsh.\"\n\nThe Saharan Empire had its faults, but even they knew better than to display such brutality openly. The S.A. Group carefully managed those optics, considering players' sensibilities. Yet here, in a player-founded kingdom...\n\n\"Hard to understand,\" he muttered, shaking his head. \"Why would Grid allow—\"\n\nWait.\n\nPanmir's eyes locked onto a figure in the middle of the procession. Grey-streaked hair. Aristocratic features buried beneath grime. The build of a swordsman gone to seed.\n\n\"No way.\"\n\nHe blinked hard, rubbed his eyes. Looked again.\n\nThe man was still there. Six flour sacks on his back. Duck-walking with the rest.\n\n*Hurent?*\n\n**THE AURA MASTER**\n\n\"Hurent!\" Panmir broke into a jog. \"What the hell are you doing here?!\"\n\nThe man's head came up slowly, as if the motion required conscious effort. Recognition flickered across his dirt-smeared face. \"Panmir?\" A tired smile. \"How did you recognize me? Everyone else thinks I just share the name.\"\n\n\"Recognize you? You bought the first epic-rated weapon I ever forged!\" Panmir gestured helplessly at the flour sacks. \"What happened? Why are you—\"\n\n\"A slave?\" Hurent laughed, the sound rough and dry. \"I'm not.\"\n\n\"Then *what*?\"\n\n\"A farmer.\"\n\nSilence stretched between them.\n\n\"A... farmer,\" Panmir repeated slowly.\n\n\"I work the fields in Bairan. Today we're transporting the harvest to Reinhardt.\" Hurent adjusted one of the sacks, and Panmir heard his shoulder pop. \"This is the farming team, not a slave gang.\"\n\n\"You've lost your mind!\" Panmir's voice cracked. \"You're a one-digit ranker! Aura Master! Hidden class! The Americans *cried* at the National Competition because you weren't there!\" He waved at the absurd procession. \"And now you're hauling grain like a pack mule?!\"\n\nWhere were the carts? The wagons? The basic tools of civilization?\n\nHurent leaned closer, voice dropping to a whisper. \"It's training.\"\n\n\"*Training?*\"\n\n\"To become stronger. The Overgeared Kingdom's methods are... unconventional. But effective.\" His eyes held a fierce gleam despite his exhaustion. \"Please. Don't spread this around. If word gets out...\"\n\nPanmir opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again like a landed fish.\n\n\"Adios.\" Hurent hoisted his burden and shuffled after the departing column, duck-stepping into the distance.\n\n\"...He's completely insane.\" Panmir watched until the procession disappeared around a corner. \"Peak of his career, and he throws it all away to be a farmer. The United States really lost a star.\"\n\nThe encounter left him unsettled. The Overgered Kingdom suddenly felt *strange*—like he'd stepped through a door into a world operating by different rules.\n\n**THE BLACK-SKINNED MASTER**\n\nThe first smithy's interior matched the complex's quality—well-organized, properly ventilated, equipped with premium tools. A figure stood by the central forge, back turned.\n\nDark skin. Muscular build. Maybe forty years old.\n\n\"Are you Panmir?\" The NPC turned.\n\n\"That's right...\"\n\n\"Excellent. I'm White.\" The blacksmith extended a calloused hand. \"Master Grid has instructed me to educate you. We'll start with needles.\"\n\nPanmir's eye twitched. *White?* The man's skin was darker than polished ebony, and his name was *White?* What kind of backwards joke...\n\nHe pushed the thought aside. Focus. \"I think there's been a misunderstanding. King Grid invited me as a colleague, not—\"\n\n\"I'm aware.\" White moved to a storage cabinet, pulling out materials. \"These are his orders. Will you refuse the king's command?\"\n\n\"I—\" Panmir's face flushed red. \"No, but I'm an advanced blacksmith. I know how to make ego items! The Imperial blacksmiths acknowledge me! And you want me to make *needles*? Something a child could produce?\"\n\nWas this an insult? A test? Grid trying to put him in his place?\n\nWhite didn't respond. He simply walked to his private furnace and set up his workspace, clearly expecting Panmir to follow or leave.\n\n*Fine.* Panmir ground his teeth. *Let's see how they really treat me here.*\n\nHe crossed the smithy floor. White was extracting something from a reinforced box—a dark, matte mineral that seemed to drink in the firelight. Not glossy like black iron, but definitely crystalline in structure. And the magic power radiating from it...\n\n\"What is this mineral?\" The words came out before Panmir could stop them. His hand reached forward involuntarily, fingers hovering over the material.\n\nWhite smiled. \"You're definitely a blacksmith. See for yourself.\"\n\nPanmir's hands trembled as he took the sample. He activated his appraisal skill immediately.\n\n>**[Insane Dragon Iron]**\n>\n>A mineral that naturally occurs in the nest of the insane dragon Nevartan.\n>\n>It has been influenced by Nevartan's madness for countless years and gained the chaotic ability 'Proliferation.'\n>\n>It doubles every 10 days.\n>\n>This absurd nature makes it very difficult to control. The hardness is comparable to black iron, but the smelting difficulty is several times higher.\n>\n>**Weight: 5**\n\n\"A dragon's lair?\" Panmir's voice came out as a whisper. \"This is from a dragon's actual lair?\"\n\nMost blacksmiths lived their entire lives without touching such materials. Dragon iron appeared in legends, not workshops.\n\n\"The doubling—does that include volume and weight?\"\n\n\"Both.\" White began stoking his furnace. \"Every ten days, it becomes twice as heavy and twice as large.\"\n\nPanmir's mind raced. The applications—armor that could repair itself by controlled regrowth, weapons that adapted to their wielders, construction materials that never depleted... \"The possibilities are incredible.\"\n\n\"Indeed. But the smelting difficulty is several times higher than black iron.\" White glanced over his shoulder. \"Which is why I'll teach you how to work it.\"\n\n\"*You*?\" The skepticism leaked out before Panmir could filter it.\n\nWhite was too young. NPCs this age typically had basic to intermediate skills. The talented prodigies occasionally reached advanced levels, but they were still far below Panmir's **Advanced Blacksmith's Craftsmanship**.\n\nHe didn't trust this. But White had been courteous, and manners cost nothing.\n\n\"I'd appreciate any guidance you can offer.\"\n\n\"Then watch.\"\n\n**THE REVELATION**\n\nWhite tossed the insane dragon iron into the furnace.\n\n*Whoosh.* The flames leaped higher, hungry.\n\nPanmir leaned forward. White's furnace management was... exceptional. His control over temperature distribution matched the elderly masters back in the Empire. Not quite at craftsman level, but—\n\n*But he's so young.*\n\nThe old masters had spent lifetimes perfecting their technique. White had decades ahead of him. If he maintained this trajectory...\n\n*In ten years, he could surpass them all.*\n\nWhite pulled the heated iron from the flames. As he set it on the anvil, his entire demeanor shifted.\n\nThe friendly instructor vanished. In his place stood a warrior.\n\nThe smithy became his battlefield. The roaring furnace—the cries of enemies. The glowing iron atop the anvil—the enemy king. White gripped his hammer like a general's sword, radiating the absolute authority of a conqueror.\n\nHe raised the hammer.\n\n*TTANG!*\n\nThe sound rang through Panmir's bones. It wasn't just force—it was precision. Mastery. Each strike placed with millimeter accuracy, reshaping the dragon iron through pure technique.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!*\n\n\"Impossible...\" Panmir's jaw hung slack. \"Your hammering quality—it equals the craftsmen of the Empire!\"\n\nWhite didn't pause in his rhythm. \"I lead the White Hammer Smithy. I'm Grid's disciple.\" *Ttang!* \"Through his compassion and precious teachings—\" *Ttang!* \"—I achieved craftsman rank.\"\n\n\"Grid doesn't just advance his own skills?\" Panmir's voice cracked. \"He raises other craftsmen too?\"\n\n\"King Grid has three other disciples besides me.\" White set down his hammer, examining the reshaped iron. \"Enoch of the Blue Flames. Byuksan of the Black Anvil. Lahochu of the Red Tongs. All of us received orders to educate you.\"\n\n*Thump-thump. Thump-thump.*\n\nPanmir's heart hammered against his ribs—fierce enough to worry a man approaching his hundredth year. Four craftsmen. Four different specializations. All willing to share their knowledge.\n\n\"Starting today, you'll learn from all four of us.\" White met his eyes. \"It will be grueling. I need to know—do you have the determination?\"\n\n>**[A Hidden Quest has been created.]**\n\n>**[Learn the Blacksmithing Techniques (1)]**\n>\n>**★ Hidden Quest ★**\n>\n>You must spend 10 hours daily with White for 300 days, learning his hammering techniques.\n>\n>**Quest Progress:** 1/300\n>\n>**Quest Reward:** White Hammer Family's Hammering skill.\n\nTen hours a day. Three hundred days. Four teachers.\n\nTwelve hundred days total. Over three years of dedicated study.\n\nIt was insane. Exactly the kind of \"training\" that would turn someone into Hurent—hauling flour sacks and duck-walking through the streets.\n\nPanmir didn't hesitate.\n\n\"I accept!\" He dropped into a formal bow. \"Thank you, King Grid, for this opportunity! I'll follow your teachings with everything I have!\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n>**[The quest has been accepted.]**\n\nWhite's expression shifted back to instructor mode—friendly warmth replaced by strict authority. \"Then gather coal. Once you've prepared the materials, I'll demonstrate the insane dragon iron needles.\"\n\nPanmir blinked. \"Coal?\"\n\n\"Yes. Coal. Do you know what coal is?\" White raised an eyebrow. \"Why are you standing there with that expression? These are basic chores for a newcomer. The fundamentals of blacksmithing.\"\n\n\"I'm an advanced blacksmith—\"\n\n\"Really? Then you can quit.\"\n\n\"I'll get the coal! Right away!\"\n\nAnd so the #1 ranked blacksmith became a workshop assistant.\n\n**THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED**\n\nNo rewards arrived. No skills unlocked.\n\nPanmir hauled coal. Cleaned furnaces. Sorted materials. Fetched water. Organized tools.\n\nOccasionally, Bland would appear with rainbow-colored potatoes—strange, shimmering tubers that tasted like concentrated sunlight. They restored stamina faster than any potion.\n\nThe work was brutal. Exhausting. Mind-numbing.\n\nHis **Persistence** stat climbed steadily. His **Stamina** rose faster than it had in years.\n\nAnd through it all, Panmir smiled.\n\nBecause he was learning. Truly learning.\n\nEvery coal bucket carried, every furnace cleaned—he watched White work. Absorbed the subtle techniques. The way the craftsman tested iron temperature with the back of his knuckles. How he positioned ingots for optimal heat distribution. The rhythm of his hammer strikes, each one flowing into the next like choreographed dance steps.\n\nThis was the path Grid had walked. The foundation upon which legends were built.\n\nNot glory. Not shortcuts.\n\nJust a man, a hammer, and endless hours of dedicated work.\n\n*Thank you, King Grid,* Panmir thought, carrying another bucket of coal across the smithy floor. *Thank you for showing me what I'd forgotten.*\n\n*That to become a master, first you must remember how to be a student.*"
