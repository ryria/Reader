  "content": "\"Bastards.\"\n\nGrid stared at his experience bar with mounting frustration. One level—from 398 to 399—shouldn't be this difficult. He'd estimated the requirement would double, perhaps triple at most. Reality had proven far crueler. The experience needed wasn't twice as much. It was **ten times** greater.\n\nTwo weeks. Fourteen days spent grinding through the Ruins of the War God, interrupted only by a brief return to Reidan for Ultimate Transformation. He'd hunted without pause in what was currently Satisfy's most punishing hunting ground.\n\nProgress gained: 0.09%.\n\nThis wasn't natural progression. This was a wall.\n\n*So that's why defeating Berith didn't push me over.* Grid's jaw tightened. *At this rate, shouldn't I have leveled up by now?*\n\nHe understood his own capabilities better than anyone. If his level matched an ordinary ranker's, his power exceeded theirs significantly. Yet how were normal players supposed to meet these crushing requirements? Without overwhelming hunting efficiency, it seemed impossible.\n\n*Give it a year. Everyone will call 399 an interval level.*\n\nAn entire generation of users would stagnate here, trapped by exponential growth curves. The realization made Grid appreciate how valuable level-granting quests truly were—even the cursed minus levels from his early days as Pagma's Descendant now seemed precious in hindsight.\n\n\"This is exhausting...\"\n\nA grim thought surfaced: somewhere in S.A. Group headquarters, the operations team was probably watching his struggle while laughing over fried chicken.\n\n*...No, even they wouldn't be twisted enough to enjoy fried chicken while—*\n\nA whisper interrupted his spiral.\n\n—Grid! Grid! I found a quest that looks promising!\n\n—Really? Congratulations.\n\nCoke's excitement bled through the mental connection.\n\n—You can join me! It's designed for multiple people!\n\n—A cooperative quest? Grid's interest piqued, though not for the reasons Coke expected. —What are the rewards?\n\n—A unique-rated skill book!\n\nCoke's pride was palpable. For him, this was a golden opportunity—a chance to acquire a unique skill. He clearly expected Grid to share his enthusiasm.\n\n—That's it?\n\n—W-Well, there's also a title! And we can gain affinity with someone important!\n\nGrid's expression remained flat. High-ranking players averaged twelve titles. He possessed over thirty, most of exceptional quality. Another title held little appeal.\n\nThe affinity, however...\n\n—Affinity with whom?\n\n—I'm... not entirely sure...\n\n—Our Coke's learning to crack jokes now?\n\n—It also gives experience!\n\n—Where's that pretty face of yours?\n\n***\n\n**Reinhardt, Capital of the Overgeared Kingdom**\n\n\"Suspicious.\"\n\nLauel's tone carried unmistakable doubt. \"Who shares a hidden quest with a stranger? I'd estimate a ninety-nine percent chance this is either a trap or elaborate prank.\"\n\n\"Resh has been active on the Chivalry forums for over fifteen years,\" Coke protested. \"His reputation's solid. I don't think his credibility is that low.\"\n\n\"Coke.\" Lauel's patience wore thin. \"Do you believe the internet is inherently trustworthy? How prestigious is this 'Chivalry' site that fifteen years of activity guarantees anything?\"\n\n\"It's a community where knight enthusiasts discuss historical and contemporary knighthood! The tradition goes back twenty years—\"\n\n\"A gathering place, nothing more. Half the medieval knights were bandits who plundered peasants and boasted endlessly.\"\n\n\"Prime Minister Lauel! That's completely unfair!\"\n\n\"I'm referencing historical knights, not Satisfy's knight class.\"\n\n\"You're insulting Jude right now!\"\n\n\"Enough.\" Grid raised a hand, cutting through the argument. He'd been listening quietly, forming his own assessment. \"Lauel, I understand your concern for our safety. But your suspicion misses something.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Who shares hidden quests with strangers? Someone without friends.\"\n\nThe blunt observation hung in the air.\n\n\"I know that position intimately.\" Grid's voice carried unexpected empathy. \"Imagine you've got a quest requiring two additional participants, but no companions to ask. What choice remains? You search online.\"\n\n\"...Possible.\"\n\n\"We'll investigate in person. Meet him first, assess the legitimacy.\"\n\n\"If it's a trap—\"\n\n\"I'll handle it.\"\n\n\"Fine. But request friend status and set your information to open mode. Encourage him to do the same—subtly. We need to verify his credentials.\"\n\nGrid nodded and sent the request to 'Resh##3.'\n\nThe numerical suffix indicated order of account creation. Among two billion players, thousands might choose the name 'Resh.' Being third meant early adoption—someone who'd joined Satisfy near launch.\n\n> **Name:** Resh  \n> **Level:** 363  \n> **Affiliation:** None\n\n\"High ranker Resh!\" Coke's eyes widened in recognition.\n\nLauel's skepticism softened to surprise. Only Grid looked confused.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"He's maintained top one-thousand rankings for five consecutive years,\" Coke explained rapidly. \"Never joins guilds, avoids publicity, stays completely mysterious—but his name carries serious weight.\"\n\n\"Five years?\"\n\nThat required consistency bordering on obsession. Most players experienced fluctuations—rises and falls, good months and bad. Only exceptional individuals like Kraugel or the Overgeared core members maintained steady trajectory. Sustaining elite status across five years, through shifting metas and endless competition, demonstrated genuine skill.\n\n\"He's Korean too!\" Coke's excitement bubbled over, clearly a longtime admirer.\n\nLauel's wariness dissolved further. \"You may proceed. Someone with this much to lose wouldn't risk setting a trap for His Majesty.\"\n\n***\n\n**Titan, Capital of the Saharan Empire**\n\nGrid and Coke arrived at the meeting point, only to freeze in astonishment. Resh wasn't just any player—he wore the insignia of the 2nd Imperial Prince's household. The position required substantial achievement; direct service to imperial royalty wasn't granted lightly.\n\n\"I hesitated before reaching out,\" Resh admitted immediately. \"Then I remembered your relationship with the dukes. That gave me courage.\"\n\nAn imperial knight, reaching across enemy lines to the Overgeared King. The political risk alone should have deterred him. But the Berith raid had been broadcast globally—Grid's camaraderie with the empire's dukes was public knowledge.\n\n\"This...\" Grid's expression darkened as he absorbed the quest details. \"The situation's worse than I thought.\"\n\nThe dukes who might have bridged the gap between empire and kingdom now faced persecution. If the emperor turned against them, reconciliation became impossible.\n\n\"The emperor departed Titan days before the dukes arrived,\" Resh interjected quickly. \"He can't be behind this. Only one suspect makes sense—4th Imperial Prince Edan.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nEdan. Son of Empress Marie, the woman who'd brainwashed Asmophel and orchestrated Piaro's downfall. Grid's teeth ground together.\n\n*My fault. Piaro's exposure triggered this.*\n\nEdan must have panicked after Piaro's truth emerged. With the emperor absent, he'd moved against the dukes preemptively.\n\n*If he's using Yatan's Essence...*\n\nFew items in Satisfy matched the Essence's insidious power—personality destruction through an evil god's corruption. Grid had witnessed its effects firsthand with Asmophel and the elves.\n\n*Empress Marie collaborates with the Yatan Church. Her son probably has access too.*\n\n\"We enter the Abyss immediately.\"\n\nQuest rewards no longer mattered. As Overgeared King and friend to the dukes, Grid felt obligation burn through hesitation.\n\n\"We rescue them before it's too late.\"\n\n\"Our mission is securing the prisoner list, not—\"\n\n\"Rescue the dukes, obtain the list. Simple.\"\n\n\"...\" \n\nResh's eyes widened. Grid's reputation for cultivating powerful connections was legendary, but Resh had assumed media exaggeration played a role. Celebrities rarely matched their public image.\n\nYet here stood Grid, risking everything for enemy nobles out of genuine friendship. The concept seemed lifted from an idealistic film—beautiful, improbable sincerity.\n\n*This is why talents flock to him.*\n\nResh glanced at Coke, the young ranker serving Grid with obvious devotion. Something long dormant stirred in Resh's chest.\n\n\"Understood. My lord will celebrate the dukes' rescue as well. You have my full cooperation.\"\n\n***\n\n**The Abyss**\n\nThe empire's most notorious dungeon yawned before them—a descent so vast and deep its true dimensions remained unmeasured. Legends claimed a meteorite had struck here in ancient times, splitting the continent. The pitch-black tunnel radiated primal dread.\n\n\"A tunnel in the wilderness,\" Resh observed. \"No external guards because no one approaches voluntarily.\"\n\n\"I understand why now.\" Coke's voice trembled. \"Just being near this place is terrifying.\"\n\nHe wasn't exaggerating. Genuine fear crept across his features.\n\nGrid clapped his shoulder firmly. \"Focus. This isn't the place to let your guard down.\"\n\nHis transcendent intuition had already activated.\n\n> [Your intuition senses danger.]  \n> [Caution is required when acting.]\n\nShould he summon reinforcements? The warning gave him pause. Yet Grid restrained the impulse. The quest specified three participants—exceeding that number might trigger system penalties.\n\n\"Stories say the Abyss's depths connect to another world,\" Resh explained as they approached the entrance. \"Hell itself touches this place, saturating it with demonic energy. Non-human guardians patrol inside—expect difficult combat. I'll take point as quest holder.\"\n\nWithout further delay, Resh stepped into the yawning darkness. Shadows swallowed them whole.\n\n***\n\n**Celestial Palace**\n\nEvening transformed the mysterious timber and stone structure into radiance itself—a brilliance that erased the boundary between day and night. The Grandmaster's palace blazed with otherworldly splendor.\n\n\"An opportunity to glimpse the answer?\"\n\nGrandmaster Zikfrector's eyes gleamed with subtle interest as he studied the magic crystal floating before him. Within the sphere's depths, images moved like recorded footage.\n\nOvergeared King Grid descended into the Abyss."
