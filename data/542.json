  "content": "> [You have defeated an armored needle.]\n> [121,599,800 experience has been acquired.]\n> [Number of armored needles killed: 2/10]\n\n*This is exceptional hunting.*\n\nThe experience granted by a single armored needle exceeded that of true blood vampires by more than double. Compared to the junior vampires lurking in the cities, the difference was staggering—thirty times the reward. Grid had already reached **level 322**, and his progress showed no signs of slowing.\n\nYet despite these gains, he couldn't consider Pangea Castle's dungeon an ideal hunting ground. The fundamental problem was simple: armored needles rarely appeared.\n\n*Just like Sua warned me.*\n\nArmored needles were solitary monsters. That initial encounter with six of them had been an anomaly, a stroke of fortune. While the Red Phoenix Group felt relieved when they encountered only one armored needle at a time, Grid could only feel mounting frustration.\n\n*If only they respawned in pairs consistently.*\n\nHe needed more silver thread—desperately. Anxiety gnawed at him. With all his titles combined, Grid's **dexterity** had reached exactly **3,723**. That meant he could theoretically control a maximum of ten silver threads simultaneously. Two threads simply weren't enough. He needed eight more, and he needed them quickly to maximize his combat potential.\n\n\"Hrmm.\"\n\nTen minutes of wandering had yielded only two more armored needles. From somewhere down the passage ahead, slow, deliberate footsteps echoed toward them. Grid decided to try something new. Just as the armored needles had restrained Noe and the God Hands earlier, he would turn their own technique against them using his two silver threads. The technique needed a name...\n\n\"Needle Binding!\"\n\nThe name felt somewhat derivative, but this wasn't a joke. Grid had given the matter serious thought.\n\n*Hwiririk!*\n\nSilver thread spiraled through the air, wrapping tightly around the armored needle's body. The strands secured its waist and both arms in a firm hold—a testament to Grid's exceptional dexterity.\n\n*Yes! I did it!*\n\nSatisfaction bloomed across Grid's face. It lasted all of two seconds.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Uwaaaaah!\"\n\nThe armored needle flexed its muscles. The silver thread snapped free.\n\n*The binding is too weak.*\n\nTwo threads lacked sufficient strength. And it wasn't just the armored needles—most monsters above **level 200** would shake off bindings made from only two strands with ease.\n\n*I need at least ten strands to make this work.*\n\nGrid recalled the silver threads while processing this limitation, twisting the two strands into one before launching it like an arrow. Controlling two strands of silver thread took two seconds. By extension, controlling ten strands would require roughly ten seconds. He needed to push his **dexterity** to **4,000 points**. At that threshold, his control rate would double.\n\nWhat if he could manipulate ten silver threads in just five seconds? Combined with pavranium, he'd have created the ultimate dual weapon system.\n\n*The only remaining weakness is throwing speed.*\n\nThread was inherently light—even silver thread. There were clear physical limits to how fast Grid could launch it. Against agile opponents, effectiveness would drop sharply.\n\n*To weaponize silver thread properly, I should attach blades at the ends. Or set up battlefield traps to exploit it.*\n\n*Dugun dugun!*\n\nAs Grid devised various applications for the silver thread, he felt himself growing stronger. The realization struck him suddenly: his potential for development had increased exponentially since acquiring this material.\n\n*If I fought Kraugel now—the same Kraugel from the National Competition—I'd win. Guaranteed.*\n\nHe was certain of it. The problem was that Kraugel was also evolving. Kraugel had obtained the Sword Saint class, described as the strongest combat class in existence. Grid couldn't even imagine how powerful Kraugel had become now, having already dominated the rankings with a normal class.\n\n*...Damn, my pride can't take this.*\n\nLagging behind a normal class despite possessing a legendary class? At the time, he'd accepted it as natural due to his lack of talent. But now, the thought filled him with shame.\n\n*I need to erase this humiliation.*\n\nGrid's motivation surged. Passion to forge ahead of Kraugel filled his chest like a roaring flame.\n\n***\n\n\"Light?\"\n\nGrid, Sua, and the Red Phoenix members finally regained normal vision as they ventured deep into the dungeon's interior. Until now, the walls had seemed to devour all illumination. But here, jade covered the surfaces, emanating a soft glow that bathed everything in gentle radiance.\n\n\"There was a place like this in the dungeon?\" one member whispered.\n\nFour years had passed since the Red Phoenix Group began their dungeon expeditions. In all that time, they had never penetrated this deeply. They always returned after engaging a handful of armored needles near the entrance. But today was different.\n\nGrid had taken point, eliminating every armored needle that appeared and allowing those behind him to venture into the castle's deepest recesses. Thanks to his efforts, they now found themselves in a beautiful chamber surrounded by jade walls. The group quickly spread out to investigate. A clear lake sparkled at the room's center, and precious herbs grew naturally along its banks.\n\n\"The temperature is perfect. People could live here if they had food,\" Sua observed.\n\n\"But what about these four passages?\" another member asked nervously. \"Won't we be completely isolated if armored needles attack us from all directions?\"\n\n\"Um... That's true.\"\n\nWhat was this place? As the group continued their search, several members noticed something submerged in the clear lake.\n\n\"What is this? Wait! This is—!\"\n\n\"A treasure chest! A treasure chest!\"\n\nLike most dungeons, Pangea Castle occasionally spawned treasure chests. However, the probability was extraordinarily low. In four years, the Red Phoenix Group had found no more than ten. Now, deep underwater as if deliberately hidden, sat another chest. Grid's eyes lit up with interest.\n\n\"Will it contain gold?\"\n\nThree hours had passed since entering the castle's dungeon. Despite the meager hunting results, Grid's face brightened at the sight of the treasure chest. As he reached for it, the Red Phoenix members stopped him.\n\n\"It could be dangerous.\"\n\n\"Last year, a colleague opened a treasure chest from this dungeon and got poisoned.\"\n\nTheir warning held weight. Treasure chests in this dungeon had a fifty-fifty chance of being traps.\n\n\"Then you're just going to leave it unopened?\" Grid asked.\n\nThe Red Phoenix members shook their heads.\n\n\"Not at all. We're just concerned about you getting hurt.\"\n\n\"Leave it to us. Grid can't be injured on our watch.\"\n\nGrid had been clearing armored needles on behalf of the Red Phoenix members. His motivations were selfish, true. But as a result, he'd provided invaluable assistance to both the group and Pangea itself. The Red Phoenix members wanted to repay that debt.\n\n*Gulp.*\n\nThe members pulled the treasure chest from the lake, swallowing nervously. They worried about poison or serious injury when opening the lid. They refused to risk Grid's safety.\n\n*Clink!*\n\nThe member's hands trembled as he grimaced, steeling himself. Finally overcoming his fear, he attempted to lift the lid. Or rather, he tried to.\n\n\"Huh? It won't open?\"\n\n\"Is it locked?\"\n\nThe Red Phoenix Group's tension evaporated momentarily. The solemn atmosphere lightened.\n\n\"Isn't it rare for locked treasure chests to contain traps?\"\n\n\"That's right. They're usually filled with treasures.\"\n\n\"Ah...! Let's give this to Grid!\"\n\nThey wouldn't have made it this far without him. The treasure chest's ownership naturally belonged to Grid. The Red Phoenix Group politely presented the box to him.\n\n\"There's a locksmith in Pangea. He can probably open this within a week,\" one member explained.\n\n\"It'll cost quite a bit, since it requires specialized skills,\" another added.\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nGrid accepted the chest and immediately frowned.\n\n> [This chest contains special magic. The weight is incredible.]\n> [Your weight gauge has been exceeded. Movement speed will decrease by 80%.]\n\n\"...\"\n\nWith his **stamina** reduced to this level, continuing the armored needle quest was impossible. Grid still needed to hunt three more armored needles, making this treasure chest nothing but dead weight. But Grid didn't care. He possessed a universal key!\n\n*Clink!*\n\nGrid produced a black key and unlocked the chest in one smooth motion. Absurdly easy. He simply inserted the key into the lock, twisted it, and the mechanism released. Sua and the Red Phoenix members stared in shock at the impossible sight.\n\n*'Opening a dungeon treasure chest instantly?'*\n\n*'What just happened?'*\n\n*'Grid is ridiculously skilled... Was he born under a lucky star?'*\n\nSua didn't understand why her face was burning. Then—\n\n> [The trap box has been opened!]\n> [Poisonous smoke has covered you!]\n> [You have suffered 4,883 damage.]\n> [You have been poisoned!]\n> [Your head is spinning!]\n> [You cannot move your lower body!]\n> [You will lose 4,500 health per second!]\n> [You have resisted.]\n> [A mysterious figure appears!]\n> [A quest has been created...]\n\n...\n\n...\n\n\"G-Grid!\"\n\nSua and the Red Phoenix members cried out in alarm. The poison billowing from the box was identical to the toxin that had afflicted their colleague last year. Grid had inhaled a massive dose and certainly couldn't be safe. Shock paralyzed most of the group, but Sua responded with calm efficiency.\n\n\"Get to Grid and give him an antidote! Then escape from this place with him!\"\n\nAt that moment—\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nAn unfamiliar voice echoed through the chamber.\n\n\"Kyaooooh!\"\n\nArmored needles poured from all four passages simultaneously. Eight of them. A middle-aged man materialized behind Grid as the group found themselves surrounded. Sua and the Red Phoenix members recognized him instantly. Recognition was impossible to avoid.\n\n\"Arube!\"\n\nOnce the closest aide to Han Seokbong, he had supposedly been murdered by the evil daoist priest who'd attacked Pangea two years ago. Instead, he'd been hiding in the dungeon's depths all along. He was the master of the armored needles!\n\n\"You... You betrayed Father,\" Sua breathed.\n\nSua was an intelligent young woman. In truth, she'd suspected Arube's involvement in that invasion all along.\n\nArube's smile twisted with cruel satisfaction. \"Indeed, Pangea's flower is beautiful even in anger. Excellent. I'll transform you into a jiangshi. After death, you'll serve me forever.\"\n\n\"You! How dare you insult the young lady!\"\n\nThe enraged Red Phoenix members drew their weapons. Arube laughed.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\n\"Seven years have passed since I discovered the armored needles slumbering here. Three years before Lord Han Seokbong even suspected their existence. During that time, I steadily tamed these creatures, and now they are my faithful servants. You won't lay a finger on me. Before you can reach me, you'll be shredded into minced meat by their silver threads.\"\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nThe Red Phoenix members flinched. Their rage at Arube's sudden appearance had made them forget the crucial detail: he commanded eight armored needles. This was the worst possible situation.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nJoy flooded Arube's features as he watched the frightened Red Phoenix members. He folded his arms across his chest, face flushed with triumph.\n\n\"Kukuk...! This is exhilarating. Now you'll understand. I've dreamed of this moment since I first discovered the armored needles seven years ago. The day when I'd hold both Pangea and Sua in the palm of my hand!\"\n\n\"You insane... You traitorous bastard!\"\n\nThe Red Phoenix members realized Arube had lost his sanity. Desperation set in. They didn't know if the poisoned Grid behind them had survived. They would all die here today.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\n\"...\"\n\nWait—what was that sound? Why did hammering noises keep echoing through the chamber? Arube belatedly became aware of it. Sua and the Red Phoenix members glanced behind them, then froze in astonishment.\n\n\"G-Grid?\"\n\nThe man who'd been poisoned upon opening the box—the one who should be dying—was currently crouched before an anvil, working.\n\n\"?????\"\n\nQuestion marks materialized above every head in the chamber.\n\n\"Has he lost his mind?\" Arube muttered.\n\nDiscovering Grid's presence, Arube scowled. He was profoundly displeased that a mere blacksmith would ruin this historic moment.\n\n\"Not understanding the gravity of your situation and hammering away... Are you insane?\"\n\nGrid responded without looking up.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm not exactly normal.\"\n\n*Ttaang~!*\n\n**Item Combination.**\n\nThe ability suffered from a critical weakness—the lengthy activation time made it nearly impossible to use mid-combat. But once successful, it produced overwhelming results. Grid successfully combined **+9 Failure** and **+8 Grid's Greatsword**, then issued commands to the God Hands.\n\n\"**Item Transformation**. Failure.\"\n\n*Kiiiing.*\n\nFour golden hands morphed into shark-shaped golden greatswords. An instant later—\n\n*Kwa kwa kwa kwang!*\n\nBecause pavranium reproduced them, the four golden Failures surpassed the original's power, piercing through armored needle bodies like paper. Blood sprayed in all directions, threatening to splash Sua and the Red Phoenix members.\n\n\"**Linked Kill Wave**.\"\n\n*Ku kwa kwa kwa kwa! Ku kwa kwa kwa kwa!*\n\nA storm of energy erupted, engulfing Arube completely.\n\n\"Wh... What?\"\n\nArube couldn't process the situation properly. He reflexively shrank back. Grid faced him and offered genuine gratitude.\n\n\"Thanks for the new quest.\"\n\nConfidence radiated from Grid's expression as soon as he'd learned the contents of the SS-grade quest."
