  "content": "『 Kraugel, Damian, and Overgeared... The strongest raid party, which might never happen again, is facing its biggest challenge. 』\n\n『 I can't see any more hope. The opponent was too strong. It's time to accept reality. 』\n\nThe Great Demon Belial raid had failed. No one could stop her. Belial would run rampant, and the continent would descend into chaos and terror.\n\n『 After the Overgeared Guild falls, Belial will establish herself in the Eternal Kingdom, gradually transforming it into a hellscape. 』\n\nPlayers would be forced into endless battles against the creatures Belial spawned. The game's difficulty would skyrocket. Regret hung heavy over everyone as Overgeared's raid crumbled.\n\n**Supak!**\n\nA blue-white radiance split the darkness of hell. Remnants of sunlight poured through the tear, illuminating the black and crimson expanse of the 32nd Hell. A figure descended through that light—Grid.\n\nHe appeared alongside his sister Ruby, immediately activating **Summon Knights** to rescue Piaro and Jude from the brink of death. Then he descended to the battlefield in a flowing sword dance.\n\n『 G-Grid! 』\n\n『 Ahh! Just as the Overgeared Guild was about to collapse, the true hero finally arrives! 』\n\n『 Dramatic timing as always! It's incredible! 』\n\n『 It's almost suspicious. 』\n\n『 Deliberately sacrificing his colleagues for a grand entrance... Haha, isn't that a bit much? 』\n\n—Kuk, it's God Grid.\n\n—He looks so cool using Blackening.\n\n—Doesn't that decadent vibe suit Grid perfectly?\n\n—Wait, how long was he fighting 100,000 troops in Bairan? He recovered already and made it to Reinhardt? Insane stamina.\n\n—Probably has an item for quick recovery.\n\n—Overgeared ㅋㅋㅋ Truly overgeared.\n\n—Grid personifies overgeared.\n\nThe first Legendary Class. Holder of the most medals in the National Competition. The man with the shortest clear times. Leader of Overgeared.\n\nGrid's arrival—rivaling even the Sky above the Sky—sent shockwaves across the globe. Viewers worldwide, hearts aching for the struggling Overgeared members, erupted into jubilant cheers. A Great Demon, enemy to all players! Countless prayers arose that Grid would defeat Belial and restore peace.\n\nBut could it be that simple?\n\n『 Isn't Grid weaker than the more powerful Kraugel? 』\n\n『 True... Even Kraugel's world-splitting attack couldn't finish Belial. 』\n\n『 With all the Overgeared members down, can Grid defeat Belial alone...? 』\n\n『 He arrived too late. If only they'd fought together from the start... 』\n\nBefore the commentators could finish their doubts, Grid descended with terrifying momentum and unleashed the ultimate slashing technique—**Pinnacle Kill**. The combined force of <span class=\"blue-orichalcum\">Failure</span> and Grid's Greatsword, fused through **Item Combination**, bit deep into Belial's thick hide.\n\n**Peeeeeong!**\n\n\"Kuock!\"\n\nA bell-like chime reverberated through the 32nd Hell, followed by Belial's groan. She staggered back, disbelief written across her face. The soulless wretch before her—why did he appear now to interfere? Confusion rippled across Belial's features.\n\nHer health gauge, which had been at 100%, plummeted to 10% once more.\n\nThe world reeled.\n\n—????????????????????\n\n—Belial's health...? How did one blow do that much damage?\n\n—Belial's final form has low defense, high attack, right?\n\n—Even with low defense, she's still a Great Demon;;; Losing 9/10 of her HP in one strike...\n\n—Grid's attack power was always broken. Imagine if Grid had Kraugel's Space Sword ㅋㅋㅋ\n\nGrid's reputation soared from the misunderstanding—not that he'd intended it.\n\n\"You... Appearing out of nowhere and attacking! You're as shameless as ever! I, the great monarch of the 32nd Hell, am speaking. Listen!\"\n\nGrid's brow furrowed.\n\n\"What nonsense are you spouting? Do you even know who I am?\"\n\n\"Nonsense? **You're** talking nonsense!\"\n\nMock a ruler of Hell? The Great Demon Belial wasn't accustomed to such insolence. Rage simmered beneath her skin.\n\n\"I'll make you regret this! Yes, good! Let's see how this ends for you!\"\n\nThe soulless man had appeared in Hell and grown at an alarming rate. He was as dangerous as that low-grade demonkin Iyarugt, who'd once ravaged Hell's ecosystem. Any Great Demon ranked beyond the 30th feared him—he had to be eliminated.\n\nBut the soulless wretch was a master of hit-and-run tactics, impossible to corner. Until now. An unexpected opportunity to end him had finally presented itself.\n\n\"Your demonic power is barely half-pure, while mine is absolute! I am the Queen of Darkness! I will carve it into your hollow heart!\"\n\n**Kurururung!**\n\nBelial erupted with demonic power. Gravitational force warped the space around Grid, dragging him forward as a maelstrom of dark lightning engulfed him.\n\n**Kwajajajajak!**\n\nA horrific sound rang out—like flesh and bone being pulverized. Viewers and Overgeared members alike froze in terror.\n\n\"G-Grid!\"\n\n\"Grid!\"\n\n*Another new spell from Belial?* The Overgeared members reeled at the Great Demon's overwhelming power. But within the gravitational field, Grid was calmly swapping equipment.\n\n> [Dark Bus' Earrings have been released. Blackening is forcibly cancelled.]\n\n> [Triple Layers has been released and the Holy Light Armor has been equipped.]\n\nGrid understood the structure of his items intimately. His equipment-swapping speed was blindingly fast!\n\n> [The effect of the Holy Light Armor has been activated, resisting the dark magic.]\n\nThe Holy Light Armor's low-probability dark magic negation triggered perfectly. Grid emerged unscathed.\n\n**Kwarururung!**\n\nAs the dark storm dissipated...\n\n> [Player Kraugel has invited you to join the party. Accept?]\n\n> [You have accepted. You have joined the Belial Raid party.]\n\n> [You are in party leader Kraugel's field.]\n\n> [**Sword Saint's Aura** is perfectly applied. Damage to enemies will increase by 30%. Sword skill damage will double.]\n\n\"Phew.\"\n\nA custom buff exclusive to Kraugel? Grid felt both awe and envy at such abilities. Then—\n\n\"**Blacksmith's Rage. Linked Kill!**\"\n\n\"What—?\"\n\n**Puk!**\n\nA massive greatsword materialized, scattering the remnants of the dark storm.\n\n**Puok!**\n\nThe second strike.\n\n**Puuok!**\n\nThird, fourth, fifth. The final sixth attack missed as Belial dodged, but she'd already sustained catastrophic damage. Twenty-two million health evaporated, dropping her gauge to 9%. Grid's **Linked Kill** far surpassed even Kraugel's **Space Sword** at his current level.\n\nYet Grid wasn't satisfied.\n\n*If I were Kraugel, that sixth strike would've connected.*\n\nLikely as a critical, too. Kraugel's weakness-detection ability, born from **Super Sensitivity**, exceeded even the **Slaughterer's Eye Patch**.\n\n*I need to obtain something better than the Slaughterer's Eye Patch.*\n\nOnce again, he witnessed the gap between the pure power of the Sword Saint and Pagma's Descendant, which ultimately relied on items. But Grid felt no frustration. His abilities weren't far behind, and he could create an army of overgeared warriors. He understood his potential for growth completely.\n\n\"Armor blessed by Rebecca? How can a demonic being wear such a thing?\"\n\nThe soulless man remained an enigma. Belial refocused on the battle.\n\n**Pepeng!**\n\n**Pepepepeok!**\n\nA firestorm erupted! Dark magic proving ineffective, Belial unleashed every fire spell in her arsenal. Magical bombardment struck Grid from all directions.\n\n> [You have suffered 3,800 damage.]\n\n> [You have suffered 4,190 damage.]\n\n> [You have suffered 6,930 damage.]\n\n> [You have suffered 12,083 damage.]\n\n*Damn it.*\n\nHandling multiple spell types simultaneously proved difficult. Still, thanks to the **God Hands**, the damage wasn't fatal. Belial closed in on Grid, sensing his wounds—a chance to finish him.\n\nA mistake.\n\nGrid's grim smile widened as he met her charge.\n\n\"Do you know your weakness?\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"You're **weak**.\"\n\nHe'd realized it while observing Belial on TV. She ranked below Hell Gao. If Hell Gao hadn't had his body destroyed by Muller, he would have demonstrated prowess in both close combat and magic. Hell Gao, master of hellfire, wielded those flames directly. Belial's firepower paled in comparison.\n\n\"No problem if I land direct hits!\"\n\nGrid brimmed with confidence. If he'd participated in the Belial raid from the start, they would have cleared it quickly!\n\n**Chwaruruk!**\n\nGrid smirked in satisfaction as silver threads ensnared Belial's body.\n\n\"**Can you Become the King of the Dead?**\"\n\n*Tak.*\n\n*Tak tak tak!*\n\nGrid's face flushed red as he shouted, and the **Overgeared Skeletons** responded. One wore Arube's Ring, wrapping silver threads around Belial. Level 1 skeletons restrained a Great Demon!\n\n\"**Iyarugt.**\"\n\n**Kuooooh!**\n\nBelial was temporarily immobilized. An old man materialized, wielding a crimson blade.\n\n\"I-Iyarugt?\"\n\nThe one even the 13th-ranked Zepar avoided...\n\n\"**Sublime Sword.**\"\n\nThousands of bloody thorns erupted from Belial's thick hide. Terror gripped her as she reflexively assumed a defensive stance. At that moment, a small cat with tiny horns and wings appeared before her eyes.\n\nNoe.\n\n*M-Memphis?*\n\nAn endangered species—the best demonic beast of Hell! The soulless man had tamed a memphis, which only rulers ranked 20th or higher could control?\n\n\"W-Who **are** you?\"\n\nAbove Belial's head—\n\n**Peeeeeong!**\n\nA blue flash descended from the sky. Saintess Ruby's **Sacrifice**—reviving the dead in exchange for her own health and mana. The fallen returned to life while evil burned away.\n\n\"K...Kuaaaack!\"\n\nBelial experienced agony rivaling the Demon Slayer's attacks. But an even greater terror seized her.\n\n*My soul..! My soul is burning!*\n\nGreat Demons could reincarnate eternally. Bodies could be destroyed, but souls would begin anew—Yatan's blessing granted absolute power. Yet now, her very soul was under threat. An incredible force! Fear—true fear—gripped Belial for the first time!\n\n\"**Pagma's Swordsmanship.**\"\n\nGrid seized the golden opportunity. He completed **Linked Kill Wave**. After executing it, Grid attempted to chain **Pinnacle** and **Kill** into the sequence—\n\nA notification window appeared.\n\n> [The effect of the title 'Watched by the Gods' has been activated.]\n\n> [Rebecca, the Goddess of Light whom you aided in the past, has bestowed a blessing upon you.]\n\n> *'Man who refuses to surrender, condemn the Great Demon threatening this world.'*\n\n> [A powerful force has united Linked Kill Wave and Pinnacle.]\n\n> [You have learned the new fusion skill **Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle**!]\n\n> [The reward is too great! Opposition from the other gods detected! The title 'Watched by the Gods' is permanently sealed!]\n\n**Puk!**\n\n**Puuok!**\n\n<span class=\"blue-orichalcum\">Failure</span> and Grid's Greatsword pierced Belial's body in rapid succession—the essence of **Linked Kill**.\n\n**Kwarururung!**\n\nA wave surged around the greatsword, climbing up Belial's body.\n\n**Kurururung!**\n\nThe ascending wave crested and crashed down, slashing through Belial courtesy of **Pinnacle**.\n\n> [Critical Hit!]\n\n> [The hidden passive '**God's Command**' has reset the cooldown of Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle. If reused within three seconds, no resources will be consumed.]\n\n> [Critical Hit!]\n\n> [The power of the 32nd Great Demon Belial has sharply declined!]"
