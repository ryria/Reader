Its design is perfectly calibrated to Grid's physical build and working habits, rendering it unusable by any other blacksmith.\n>\n> The ego within the pavranium core will assist its owner in countless subtle ways.\n>\n> **User Restriction:** Grid only\n>\n> **Weight:** 490\n\n> [You have created a **Myth-rated item**! All stats permanently increased by **10**!]\n\nGrid's hands trembled as golden light washed over the hammer.\n\n\"No way...\"\n\nPanmir's words echoed in his mind. *\"My chance of producing a legendary item? About 0.01%. Small, I know, but it's something to aim for.\"*\n\nFive percent.\n\n*This thing increases legendary probability by five percent.*\n\nHis previous hammer—already considered gamebreaking by the blacksmithing community—offered a 1% increase. That alone made conventional blacksmiths obsolete. But this? A fivefold improvement. More than that, actually. The new hammer eliminated the possibility of wasting materials on trash-tier items, *and* gave him a real shot at crafting myth-grade equipment.\n\nGrid's gaze slid sideways to the one feature that disappointed him.\n\n*It won't craft items on its own.*\n\nHe'd secretly hoped the pavranium would remember its time as the God Hands—automatically assisting with the countless micro-adjustments that separated masterworks from merely good items. Instead, the hammer's autonomous functions focused entirely on combat: defending him, striking enemies.\n\n*Makes sense, though.*\n\nAs God Hands, the pavranium had possessed **Dexterity** stats and accumulated blacksmithing knowledge. Now it was just a hammer. Powerful, yes. But without the skills or experience to actively help with craftsmanship.\n\n*Don't be greedy. You're not a thief.*\n\nHe unconsciously reached up, fingers brushing through his hair. The phantom ache of stress-induced hair loss prickled at his scalp—a memory from darker days. But his hair remained thick and healthy.\n\n*Tang! Tang! Tang!*\n\nHexetia's hammer rang out in steady rhythm.\n\nGrid had gone through an entire journey in the minutes since finishing his hammer—nearly collapsing from heat exhaustion, steadying himself with Khan's memory, completing the final quenching. Through it all, Hexetia had never stopped working. Now, the sword taking shape beneath the god's hands stole Grid's breath.\n\n*Perfect...*\n\nIce seemed to crystallize in the air around it. The blade—slender and short like a woman's arm, translucent as winter frost—radiated cold that pushed back the furnace heat. Delicate in appearance. Anything but weak.\n\n> [Attempting to analyze target item with **Legendary Blacksmith's Eyes**...]\n>\n> [Target item exists beyond legendary craftsmanship. Analysis failed.]\n\n*Of course it's myth-rated.*\n\nGrid wiped sweat from his forehead. What else would a god create? Naturally, beating Hexetia required producing a myth-rated sword. That had been the baseline from the start.\n\nHis expression crumpled.\n\n*Wait. Hold on.*\n\nWhy was *his* hammer myth-rated?\n\n*What are the odds of crafting two myth items back-to-back?*\n\nBlood drained from Grid's face. Nothing in the world was infinite. Luck had to be finite, pooled, exhaustible—and his pool was almost certainly smaller than average. The hammer should have been legendary. *Then* the sword would have hit myth-tier.\n\n\"Shit! I'm screwed!\"\n\nGrid flopped onto the cloud floor, legs splaying out. His hands covered his face.\n\nThen he pushed himself upright.\n\n*Experience.*\n\nThat single word steadied him. He'd forged multiple myth-rated items. He *knew* luck wasn't the only ingredient. The 'story' within materials mattered. The narrative woven through each stage of production carried weight. \n\n*Having a good story doesn't guarantee a myth rating, but...*\n\nLuck could be mitigated. Influenced. Even without his pathetic **Good Luck** stat, he could succeed.\n\nGrid exhaled slowly, deliberately. His gaze sharpened on Hexetia's work.\n\nThe artistry was sublime—beyond anything Grid had produced. Enough to make him forget his own creation?\n\n*No.*\n\nFocus returned. He began dissecting every movement, correlating each step.\n\n*Why so few folds in the metal?*\n\n*Another tempering pass? After that temperature?*\n\n*The cross-section is machine-perfect. Zero margin of error. But that's god-tier precision, I can't...*\n\n*Wait—he's skipping the grinding stage? No, the edge sharpness can be restored during repairs. Have I been over-grinding this whole time?*\n\n*That pattern isn't just aesthetic. It's designed to shed blood, keep the edge from dulling mid-combat.*\n\nLearning during competition wasn't revolutionary. Any player could improve by facing a superior opponent. Kraugel, for example, would evolve in real-time if forced to duel Zeratul. Observation, adaptation, implementation—the core of growth.\n\nFor Grid, watching Hexetia was no different. Getting kidnapped had become the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\n> [You have witnessed the techniques of the **Blacksmith God**!]\n>\n> [Your blacksmithing abilities have evolved!]\n>\n> [**Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship (Seeing the Gods' Techniques)** has transformed into **Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship (Fighting Against the Gods)**! Probability of creating superior items has increased.]\n>\n> [**Blacksmith's Breath** and **Blacksmith's Patience** have become passive skills. They will remain permanently active during all crafting.]\n\n\"Ha!\"\n\nThe grin spread across Grid's face like sunrise. Anxiety evaporated. Confidence surged.\n\n\"Alright! Let's do this!\"\n\nHis hands plunged into his inventory, withdrawing materials that glowed with otherworldly light. Black Tortoise's Breath. Blue Dragon's Breath—both prizes from the 3rd National Competition. Great Demon Astaroth's Horn. The armored shell of the cave cricket that had threatened the World Tree's Forest.\n\nTreasures most humans would never glimpse in ten lifetimes.\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\nHexetia's hammer paused mid-swing. His eyes widened.\n\n*How did a mortal obtain...?*\n\nMore importantly—\n\n*Is he seriously planning to combine all of those in a single blade?*\n\nThe technical challenge defied comprehension. Blue Dragon's Breath and Black Tortoise's Breath were fundamentally incompatible. No amount of skill could overcome that metaphysical rule.\n\n*Grid, are you...?*\n\nClaiming to surpass a god? Hexetia's surprise crystallized into something resembling awe.\n\n\"Ah, let me save this for next time.\"\n\nGrid squatted before the furnace, sliding the Black Tortoise's Breath back into his inventory.\n\n*Combining both breaths in one sword feels wrong. Unstable.*\n\n\"...\"\n\nHexetia stared.\n\n*Was that a joke? Just showing off his materials?*\n\n\"You should focus on your own work,\" Grid said mildly. \"I'm starting.\"\n\nThe mithril under Hexetia's Sword of Light technique was entering its final transformation stage. Grid turned his attention to the Blue Dragon's Breath first—reinforcing the bead's structure with successive strikes. Then into the furnace, where Hexetia's divine flames engulfed it. The bead emerged glowing white-hot.\n\n*Tang! Tang! Tang!*\n\n\"...!!\"\n\nHexetia's eyebrows shot up. Grid's new hammer moved with efficiency several magnitudes beyond his previous tool. The performance rivaled Hexetia's own divine hammer, forged from godstone.\n\nBlue lightning erupted from the Dragon's Breath with each impact. Grid's body jerked—muscles seizing as electricity coursed through him. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.\n\nHe didn't stop hammering.\n\nEven if it killed him, the work would be finished.\n\n\"This... haha... might take... a while... *ghhk!*\"\n\nAnother lightning strike interrupted him. His hair stood on end, smoke rising from his shoulders.\n\n\"You're a fool!\" Hexetia's frown deepened.\n\nEnduring potentially lethal injury for the sake of blacksmithing? Stupid. Reckless.\n\nGrid looked up through the lightning arcs, grinning despite the blood on his teeth. \"Blacksmithing is what I *do*. Same as you, isn't it? *Hiik!* Ahhh—!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n*Blacksmithing is what I do.*\n\nThe words struck Hexetia like a hammer blow. Something shifted inside him—a fundamental realization about his own existence.\n\n*Yes. I am the blacksmith god. I was born for this singular purpose.*\n\nHe didn't need to search for meaning elsewhere. What did loneliness matter? Give him a hammer and anvil, and he could work anywhere, anytime. Through blacksmithing, he proved his reason for existing.\n\n*This is what I do.*\n\nNo need to chase others' approval. No need for jealousy when encountering superior technique. Just focus on the craft. When he worked as a blacksmith, no one could deny his worth.\n\n*Yes. This is it.*\n\nThe bitterness and envy inside Hexetia crumbled away like slag. He shouted across the workshop, voice cutting through the thunder:\n\n\"Endure it, Grid! Don't you dare fall before this match ends!\"\n\nHe raised his free hand.\n\n> [The **Blacksmith God** has used his divine power.]\n>\n> [You have gained **100% Electric Shock Resistance**!]\n\n\"Hexetia!\"\n\n\"Grid!\"\n\nTheir gazes locked—two craftsmen ablaze with shared passion.\n\nSide by side, they began forging masterpieces that would never be recorded in any legend."
