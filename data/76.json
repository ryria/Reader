Its strength rivaled boss-tier monsters.\n\nThree men hung suspended in sticky webbing, bodies cocooned against the damp cave wall. Lee Junho stared at the spider's jagged mandibles as they clicked inches from his face, trying to decide which of them would be the first meal.\n\nJunho swallowed hard. \"Damn... I just wanted to go to Winston...\"\n\nWinston. A popular mid-level city in the middle of nowhere. The three of them had heard about the hunting grounds there, how you could grind monsters and earn decent money. But the goblins on the road had nearly frozen them to death, forcing them into this canyon. Now they'd become spider food.\n\nSim Kiwan shifted in his bonds, causing the web to creak. \"Why the hell did you decide to go to Winston anyway?\"\n\nJunho's face twisted. He'd been the one who suggested Winston in the first place.\n\n\"Didn't you agree?\" Junho glared at Kiwan. \"Now you're trying to blame me? Did I know it would turn out like this? Huh?\"\n\nLee Junho had a bad temper. Back in high school, he'd been the best fighter in their year. No one escaped his fists. Even Choi Chansung and Sim Kiwan, his closest friends, had suffered during Junho's most rebellious phase. They both knew better than to push him.\n\nSim Kiwan looked away. \"Sorry.\"\n\nBut Junho wasn't finished.\n\n\"The more I think about it, the more this pisses me off.\" He tried to lean forward, the webbing creaking. \"Hey, Sim Kiwan. You bastard, say something else. Go ahead. I told us to move to Winston, so we got caught by that spider? Didn't we all agree? You said it was a good idea, right? But now that things went to shit, you're blaming me? What kind of friend are you?\"\n\nKiwan kept his eyes down. \"I didn't mean to blame you. I'm just on edge. I misspoke.\"\n\n\"Then do something useful instead of apologizing, you useless piece of shit.\"\n\nChoi Chansung stepped in before the argument could escalate further. \"Why are we fighting right now? Let's figure out how to escape.\"\n\nTo be honest, Chansung and Kiwan didn't even like Junho. He'd been treating them like subordinates since high school. They were twenty-six now, not teenagers anymore. But Junho had burned too many bridges in society with his shitty attitude. He had almost no friends left. So he kept dragging Chansung and Kiwan out, relying on ten years of shared history.\n\nAnd they kept saying yes because it was easier than cutting him off.\n\nBut their patience was wearing thin.\n\n*Is he insane? Calling his friend a bastard?*\n\n*Junho can't fix his rotten personality. And Kiwan has too much pride to take this much longer.*\n\nThe tension thickened like the humid air in the cave.\n\nThen the wind shifted, carrying sounds from outside.\n\n\"! $ #! ~%\"\n\nThe noise was distant and garbled, but the canyon spider's head snapped toward the cave entrance. Its legs scraped against stone as it rose, mandibles clicking excitedly.\n\n\"Kikikik...\"\n\nThe spider scuttled toward the entrance, eager for fresh prey.\n\nThe three men exhaled in unison.\n\n\"Thank god...\" Kiwan whispered.\n\n\"I thought I was dead.\"\n\nJunho twisted his body against the bonds. \"Come on, let's get out of this!\"\n\nAs a level 88 warrior who'd dumped most of his points into strength, Junho strained against the webbing. His muscles bulged. The web stretched slightly.\n\nThen snapped back.\n\n\"What the hell?\" Sweat dripped down his temple. \"I can't break it even with my strength?\"\n\nAfter a full minute of struggling, Junho slumped in exhaustion.\n\nSim Kiwan took his turn. As a level 87 fire magician, he began chanting. Flames erupted around his torso.\n\n*Hwaruruk!*\n\nThe web blackened and curled.\n\n\"Yes!\" All three of them grinned.\n\nBut when the flames died, the webbing remained. Scorched and stinking, but intact. Kiwan went pale.\n\n\"It won't burn?\"\n\nChoi Chansung, a level 89 thief, drew a dagger from his inventory. \"Let me try.\"\n\nHe sawed at the sticky threads binding his wrist. The blade was sharp, honed for critical strikes. But the web didn't even show a scratch.\n\n\"This is impossible...\" Chansung stared at his dagger in disbelief.\n\nNo wonder the spider had left so casually. Three low-level idiots couldn't break the web or escape. They were livestock, penned and waiting for slaughter.\n\nKiwan let his head fall back against the cave wall. \"We're going to die here...\"\n\n\"If we're dead either way, let's just log out.\" Junho's voice had lost its edge. \"Better to lose the experience than get eaten alive.\"\n\nThey'd both tried logging out earlier. But the system message had stopped them: *In this situation, you cannot avoid death. If you log out, it will be treated as a death.*\n\nNow, with the spider gone for the moment, it seemed like the better option.\n\n\"Okay.\" Kiwan nodded. \"Let's log out. I'm not experiencing what it's like to be digested by a giant spider.\"\n\n\"Yeah, log—\"\n\n\"Wait.\" Chansung's voice was quiet but firm.\n\nJunho turned to glare at him. \"What?\"\n\n\"Isn't it shameful to just... kill ourselves? Even in a game?\" Chansung met his eyes. \"We don't know what's happening out there. Let's hold on a little longer.\"\n\n\"Are you insane?\" Junho's face flushed red. \"The spider will come back any second! Do you want to be eaten alive? I'll get arachnophobia for the rest of my life!\"\n\n\"If you have the courage to end your own life, use that courage to find a way to fight.\"\n\n\"What kind of nonsense—you know what, I don't care. We're logging out. You can stay here and be spider food if you want. Logout... huh?\"\n\nAll three fell silent.\n\n*Thump. Thump.*\n\nFootsteps. Human footsteps, coming from the cave entrance.\n\n\"What the hell...?\" Junho whispered.\n\n\"Shh!\" Chansung hissed.\n\nThey held their breath and watched.\n\nA figure stepped into the cave, silhouetted against the dim light from outside.\n\n\"That spider bastard's been alive for decades. Did it gather any treasures in here?\" The voice was male, casual. \"Damn thing was a pain to hunt.\"\n\nHe *hunted* the spider?\n\nThe three men stared. Half the stranger's face was covered by a massive skull helmet, grotesque and jagged like it had been carved from some giant monster's head. The empty eye sockets seemed to stare back at them.\n\nKiwan leaned close to Junho and whispered, \"That guy doesn't seem normal.\"\n\n\"No shit. Look at that helmet. He's a psychopath.\"\n\n\"Should we ask for help?\"\n\nJunho hesitated. \"He looks... dangerous.\"\n\n\"He might just kill us.\"\n\n\"Yeah...\"\n\nThey fell silent, weighing their options. The helmet was almost as terrifying as the spider had been.\n\nInside the helmet, Grid froze.\n\n*Isn't that Lee Junho? What the hell are those bastards doing here?*\n\nLee Junho and his lackeys. The gangsters of his high school years. Junho had been uncontrollable back then, beating up classmates, even talking back to teachers. And Grid, no, Shin Youngwoo, had been one of his favorite targets.\n\n*During high school... that bastard took exactly 67,300 won from me between second year and graduation. The other two took 23,000 and 14,000 respectively. Those three pieces of shit.*\n\nIt wasn't a pleasant memory. Youngwoo had a terrible memory for most things, forgetting names and dates easily. But he remembered every slight, every humiliation. They were burned into his brain like scars.\n\n*And it didn't end in high school either.*\n\nTwo years ago, at the alumni reunion, Lee Junho had been the first to laugh when he heard about Youngwoo's gaming addiction and debt. The other alumni had been uncomfortable at first, pitying Youngwoo. But as the drinks flowed and Junho kept mocking him, calling him pathetic, the others had joined in. By the end of the night, Shin Youngwoo had been the laughingstock of the entire reunion.\n\n*Unforgivable bastard... Of all the players in this game, I run into him? My luck is absolute garbage.*\n\nYoungwoo glared at the three trapped men through the skull helmet's eye holes.\n\nJunho seemed to feel the weight of his gaze. He forced a smile. \"E-Excuse me? Can you help us? As you can see, we're trapped. Haha.\"\n\nHe had no idea who was behind the helmet.\n\nYoungwoo almost laughed.\n\n*That bastard... he acts like the devil toward me, but puts on this fake-ass smile for strangers. Oh, wait. My face is covered, isn't it? They don't know who I am. This could be...*\n\nHonestly, Youngwoo hated the Frostlight Orc Chief's Helmet. As a unique set item, the stats were excellent. But it was hideous. Repulsive, even.\n\nRight now, though? He was grateful for it.\n\nThe helmet covered half his face. His identity was hidden. No name appeared over his head.\n\n*Now that I've run into this scum here... isn't this a perfect chance for revenge?*\n\nA laugh bubbled up from Grid's throat, low and cold.\n\nThe three men exchanged nervous glances. That laugh, echoing from inside the skull helmet, sent chills down their spines. The eyes visible through the helmet's sockets reminded them of the canyon spider's. Like they were nothing but prey.\n\n*Did we just step in shit?*\n\nAs the trio trembled, Youngwoo's gaze shifted to Choi Chansung.\n\n*Chansung...*\n\nChansung had always hung around with Junho and Kiwan. He'd been there whenever they bullied someone, standing in the background.\n\nBut Youngwoo had never actually seen Chansung participate. No extortion, no insults, no violence. In fact, Chansung usually looked uncomfortable during those moments. Youngwoo had even witnessed him arguing with Junho several times.\n\n*One time, he apologized to me on Junho's behalf... And at the alumni meetings, he never joined in the mockery. Not long ago, he even called to ask if I was coming to the reunion. He tried contacting me multiple times after that night, like he was worried. Maybe... maybe he's actually a decent guy?*\n\nYoungwoo's interpretation was correct. Chansung *had* been worried. Afraid that Youngwoo might do something reckless out of shame and desperation.\n\nWhile Junho and Kiwan mocked Youngwoo relentlessly, Chansung kept his mouth shut. He'd been friends with them since their first year of high school, stuck in a relationship built on inertia rather than genuine friendship. He didn't enjoy the bullying. He just... hadn't stopped it.\n\nBut Youngwoo's paranoia crept in.\n\n*...Anyone who's friends with Lee Junho can't be a good person. I've seen enough movies and comics to know how this works. He's the true mastermind, isn't he? Pretending to be good on the outside while being even worse than Junho on the inside.*\n\nWasn't Chansung standing behind Junho and Kiwan every time they bullied him? Wasn't he there at the reunion when Junho laughed? The more Youngwoo thought about it, the more suspicious Chansung seemed. Maybe even more dangerous than Junho himself.\n\nGrid drew the **+8 Ideal Dagger** from his belt.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms**  \nOG: Glossary Link\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
