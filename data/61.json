He straightened when I materialized. \"Did you have a good night's sleep? Are your worries relieved now?\"\n\n\"Old Man Khan.\" I walked past him toward the furnace. \"I've decided to just drop everything.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" His voice cracked. \"Drop everything?\"\n\n\"I will clear my mind and abandon my obsession.\" I pulled a fresh ingot from storage, weighing it in my hand. \"Anyway, the goods made with my poor skills aren't worthy of being delivered to the castle. It is no use, no matter how hard I try.\"\n\nKhan slammed his hand on the workbench. \"No, what are you saying? How can Pagma's Descendant say something so weak?\"\n\nThe old man's face was red. Fury rolled off him in waves. It might be acceptable for other blacksmiths to give up. But for someone as talented as me? Unacceptable.\n\nI ignored him. Turned my back. Stood in front of the furnace and started on the seventh and last sword.\n\n*I won't be obsessed with the result anymore.*\n\nNo matter how I tried, the result would be randomly decided anyway. Even knowing this, I'd been foolish enough to select the best materials and devote every scrap of effort. Waste of time. Waste of energy.\n\nI steadied my breathing. Let my shoulders drop. Unlike before, I just worked. Silently. Without worrying about the result. My accumulated knowledge took over, muscle memory guiding each hammer strike while my mind went blank.\n\nThe furnace roared. Sweat dripped down my back. My arms moved in rhythm. Heat. Strike. Heat. Strike. The world narrowed to fire and steel.\n\nThe sword started to shine as dawn arrived. Morning light crept through the smithy windows. I blinked. Had I been working all night? Time had slipped away while I was focused.\n\nA notification flashed across my vision.\n\n> [The deadline for the 'Business with the Administrator (1)' quest is in two hours. Please complete the quest within two hours.]\n\n*Quest failed.* That message would pop up soon enough. Mocking me. Rubbing my nose in it.\n\nI entered the last stage of the sword production. Quenching. The hiss of metal meeting water. Steam rising. After a while, the sword was completed.\n\nI lifted it from the cooling bath.\n\n> [<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Sword of Self-transcendence</span>]\n> \n> **Rating:** Legendary  \n> **Durability:** 365/365  \n> **Attack Power:** 356  \n> **Attack Speed:** +6%  \n> **Accuracy:** +10%  \n> **Attack and Defense Rate:** +10%\n> \n> * Will do an additional **+200** damage during each attack.\n> * The skill 'Perfect State of Self-transcendence' will be generated.\n> \n> A sword made by a craftsman with great skill and potential but lacking in experience and reputation.

But this one said 'only' instead of 'first.' The creation of a legendary item in Satisfy reminded me that I was the only Pagma's Descendant.\n\n\"......\"\n\nI found Khan squatting in the corner of the smithy. Shoulders hunched. Head down. How long had he been sitting there?\n\n*Right.* I'd been angry at him every time I couldn't make the desired item this past week. Despite my cold treatment, he kept giving me advice and encouragement. Kept trying to help.\n\nKhan must be feeling like shit. Look at him. How lonely he looked now, curled up in that corner. I must be a terrible person to him. He might be seriously questioning his decision to hand me this smithy.\n\nI slowly walked over. Rubbed his shoulders, tense from the daily repetition of hard labor.\n\n\"Old Man Khan.\" My voice came out rough. \"I'm sorry for the past week. You went through a lot of trouble because of me, didn't you? I will no longer let you be lonely.\"\n\nKhan's head snapped up. \"G-Grid...?\" Confusion twisted his weathered face. \"Surely you aren't...? Are you planning to jump into the river after making a low rated sword? Huh?\"\n\n*What?*\n\nWas it because he already lost a son? The desperation in his voice caught me off guard. I stopped his shouting by shoving the sword into his hands.\n\n\"How can I do that? Now take a look at this.\"\n\nKhan's eyes widened. His whole body started trembling. \"This... this is a masterpiece...! C-Cough!\"\n\nThe coughing fit turned violent. His face went purple.\n\n\"H-Hey! Old Man Khan! Old Man Khan!!\"\n\nToo much surprise. Khan collapsed, clutching his chest as he struggled to breathe.\n\n\"No! Don't die! You can't die!!\"\n\nKhan was the one who gave me my class quest. I hadn't even started the quest yet. It would probably take me a very long time to clear this quest. Until then, Khan needed to be alive.\n\n\"Shit!\"\n\nI lifted him. Not heavy, just frail old bones. Then I rushed toward the clinic, his weight barely registering as panic drove my feet.\n\n***\n\nThe doctor finished his examination and laughed. \"You don't have to worry. It is just a symptom of temporary shock, and he will have no problems in the future.\"\n\n\"R-Really?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The doctor's smile was kind. Pitying. \"You can rest assured and stop crying.\"\n\n\"W-What?\" Heat flushed my face. \"Who is crying?\"\n\nThe doctor just smiled. Silent. Knowing.\n\n\"Kuk...!\"\n\nI bolted from the clinic in shame and ran toward the castle.\n\n*Dammit! What nonsense was he saying? I was crying? Hah. Crazy! Who would cry because of an NPC!*\n\nBut my inventory contained two epic-rated swords and one legendary-rated sword. Confidence swelled in my chest with every step.\n\n***\n\nWinston Castle hummed with tension.\n\nThe 1,000 soldiers and 8 knights had returned from the Yatan Temple. Close to 400 casualties. Bodies wrapped in cloth. Wounded men groaning in the courtyard.\n\nIrene stared at the report in her hands. Her knuckles were white where she gripped the parchment. \"How did this happen? I heard that there are only 150 enemies. The followers of Yatan are strong, but isn't this defeat nonsense?\"\n\nPhoenix stood beside her, face grim. The knight captain's usual composure had cracked. \"According to the report, there is a great person among the Yatan followers. Even the knights weren't a match...\"\n\n\"Don't tell me...?\"\n\nPhoenix met her eyes and nodded.\n\n\"That's correct. Perhaps he...\" Phoenix paused. \"No, she is one of the rumored 'Seven Servants.'\"\n\nThe Yatan Church had seven servants. Those who received the favor of God Yatan. Powerful beings that transcended humans.\n\n\"How could such a great person be here...?\"\n\nThe nobles shifted in their seats. Fear rippled through the meeting room like a stone dropped in still water.\n\n\"If one of the Seven Servants is present, Winston might turn to hell!\"\n\n\"We should reach out to Earl Steim right now...!\"\n\nIrene remained still. Calm. She ignored the nobles and spoke to Phoenix.\n\n\"Many of the rumors about the Seven Servants are exaggerated. Isn't it? If the Seven Servants are really as strong as rumored, the temples wouldn't have been wiped out.\"\n\nPhoenix relaxed slightly. \"Yes. The Seven Servants aren't as strong as everyone thinks.\"\n\nIrene touched the blue ring on her finger. Doran's ring. \"It would be a massive blow to the Yatan Church if we kill one of the Seven Servants with our own hands. It will also honor Doran's soul.\"\n\n\"What...?\"\n\nThe nobles surged to their feet. Protests bubbled up. At that moment, the door of the conference room slammed open. The butler ran inside, gasping for breath.\n\n\"Administrator! My Lady! There is something that both of you should look at!\"\n\nHe'd interrupted the meeting between the lady and the nobles. Whatever it was must be urgent. Everyone in the conference room hurried from their seats and followed the butler outside.\n\n***\n\nThe castle's garden.\n\nA black-haired youth stood in front of the glittering fountain. Staring at the water with intense focus. Then he suddenly dove into the fountain. Literally dove. Like a cat pouncing on a fish.\n\nIrene stopped. Blinked. \"...Who is that? What is he doing?\"\n\nThe administrator cleared his throat. \"That young man is the blacksmith Grid, who created the best works displayed at the auction. However, I don't know what he is doing now. Why is he swimming in the fountain?\"\n\nThe administrator turned to the butler, who looked equally perplexed. \"I tried to guide him to the reception room, but he stayed here because he wanted to see more of the garden. That is all I know. I don't know why he's swimming in the fountain.\"\n\nThe young man emerged from the water with a splash.\n\n\"Puah!\" Water streamed down his face. \"It really is money!\"\n\nHe held up a gold coin. Kissed it. Tears welled in his eyes as he clutched the wet coin to his chest.\n\n\"I never thought I would ever pick up money...!\" His voice cracked. \"Kuuack! This is my first lucky experience in my 26 years of living!\"\n\nPhoenix watched this display and frowned. \"That... I think it is the gold coin I lost a few days ago...\"\n\n\"......\"\n\nIrene ignored Phoenix. Turned to the butler. \"So why did you bring us so urgently?\"\n\nThe butler took a deep breath. Straightened his shoulders.\n\n\"He said he came to deliver three swords to the administrator. But... the level of the swords is unbelievable, even to the eyes of a lowly person like me. My Lady, you should check it yourself...\" He swallowed hard. \"Cough, I'm sorry. I became so excited that I rudely broke into the meeting. I will accept any punishment.\"\n\n\"Hrmm...\"\n\nThe butler claimed to be a lowly person, but he needed versatility to become the butler of this castle. His eyes were superb. His judgment sound. And he was always calm. How great were these three swords to make a person like him lose composure?\n\nEveryone walked toward Grid with rising expectations.\n\nGrid noticed the approaching party. Looked up from his gold coin. Waved at the administrator. \"Good afternoon.\"\n\nThe administrator's expression tightened. \"It is polite to greet the lady first.\"\n\n\"Lady?\" Grid scanned the group and spotted Irene.\n\n*I heard that the new lady was a young and pretty virgin.*\n\nGrid bowed quickly, water still dripping from his clothes. \"It is an honor to meet you.\"\n\n\"It is nice to meet you.\" Irene's voice was measured. Polite.\n\nThe residents of Winston said that Grid worked hard for the people. Irene had planned to give Grid a reward. However, she postponed it after discovering the Yatan Temple. She wanted to handle everything properly. Therefore, she intended to give him the reward when she saw him today.\n\nBut she completely forgot about the reward when she saw his swords. Shock wiped every other thought from her mind.\n\n\"These are the three swords I made.\" Grid pulled three blades from his inventory.\n\n\"...Heok!\"\n\nGasps rippled through the gathered nobles. Even the butler, who had already seen them, couldn't hide his reaction.\n\nTwo of the three swords gleamed with uncommon light. <span class=\"rarity-epic\">Epic rated weapons</span>. Rare treasures that most nobles would kill for.\n\nBut the remaining sword...\n\nPhoenix's hand went to his chest. \"This is a sword that will come out once in 100 years!\"\n\nThe <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">legendary blade</span> seemed to drink in the sunlight. Its edge sang with potential. A masterpiece that transcended human limitations.\n\nAnd Grid stood there, soaking wet, grinning like an idiot who'd just found a gold coin in a fountain."
