But his eyes blazed with sudden clarity.\n\n*My use of the farming equipment is wrong!*\n\nHe had mastered swordsmanship decades ago. Every movement, every principle ingrained in muscle and bone. When he'd taken up farming tools, he'd simply... translated. Applied the same foundation. The same logic.\n\n*This is an obvious mistake!*\n\nFarming and swordsmanship were opposites. One cultivated life. The other harvested death. The tools might share weight and balance, but their purposes diverged at the root. He'd been poisoning his own growth.\n\n*Discard swordsmanship!*\n\nHis grip loosened. The rigid stance of a knight melted into something softer. His shoulders dropped. His weight settled into his hips. He stood like a farmer waiting for rain.\n\nLight erupted around his body.\n\nGrid blinked. A window materialized in his vision.\n\n> [Lord's Confidence]  \n> ★ Hidden Quest ★  \n> Piaro has gained new enlightenment and awakened as a true farmer.  \n> He has completely forsaken the sword.  \n> At this moment, he wants to be acknowledged by you.  \n> Spar with Piaro!  \n> Please experience Piaro's skills and acknowledge him!  \n> Depending on the results, Piaro will grow even more!  \n>  \n> Quest Clear Conditions: Win or lose in a spar with Piaro.  \n>  \n> **Defeat in a spar with Piaro:** Piaro will gain great pride as a farmer. Piaro's stats and skills will significantly rise.  \n>  \n> **Victory in a spar with Piaro:** Piaro will feel skeptical and once again walk the path of the sword. The stats that rose as a result of Piaro becoming a legend will be destroyed.\n\n> [Hidden Quest 'Lord's Confidence' will proceed.]\n\n> [Now you and Piaro have entered sparring mode.]\n\n> [The spar will continue until the health of one person reaches the minimum.]\n\n> [You won't die in sparring mode.]\n\nGrid read it twice. Then a third time.\n\n*Lord's Confidence.* A bonus quest. If he lost, Piaro would gain confidence. His stats would soar. His abilities would cement. Simple. Beneficial. Any sane lord would drop their guard and accept defeat with a smile.\n\nBut the alternative gnawed at him.\n\n*Walk the path of the sword again?*\n\nIf Grid won, Piaro would doubt himself. Return to swordsmanship. And maybe, just maybe, that path led to Sword Saint.\n\n*No guarantees.* Even for someone as talented as Piaro, becoming a Sword Saint was legendary difficulty. And forcing him back to the sword would destroy his current growth. All those stats gained from his transformation into a legend, wiped clean.\n\n*Should I lose?*\n\nHe tightened his grip on Iyarugt. The blade thrummed.\n\n*No.*\n\n*I will do my best.*\n\nPiaro wouldn't want charity. Wouldn't want his lord to roll over like a trained dog just to boost his ego.\n\n*If you want to prove the value of a farmer, beat me.*\n\nIf he couldn't surpass Grid even now, then take up the sword again. Carve your own path with your own strength. No handouts. No pity.\n\nGrid kicked off the ground. Quick Movements still had thirty seconds remaining. He'd end this before it expired.\n\n\"Blacksmith's Rage!\"\n\n> [Attack power will increase by 25% and attack speed will increase by 40%.]  \n> [This effect will last for 35 seconds.]\n\nPower flooded his limbs. He closed the distance in three strides. Iyarugt sang in his hands, red lines materializing in the air. The optimal strike paths. Grid followed them, blade whistling toward Piaro's exposed neck.\n\nPiaro bent. Not a dodge. Not a parry.\n\nHe squatted.\n\nThe sword passed overhead. Grid's eyes widened.\n\n[This guy's talent suddenly became low!]\n\nIyarugt's voice echoed in his mind, confused. Disappointed.\n\n*That means even you don't understand what he's doing.* Grid's stomach tightened. *Which means Piaro is beyond you.*\n\nPiaro slammed the hand plow into the earth.\n\nWater erupted. Not a trickle. A geyser. Muddy spray filled Grid's vision. He stumbled back, half-blind, as Piaro's other hand moved in a blur. Scattering. Sowing.\n\nSeeds hit the wet ground.\n\nAnd grew.\n\nWheat. Golden stalks bursting from the soil in seconds. A field spread around Grid's feet, hemming him in. Stalks thick as a man's thumb, heavy with grain. The impossible made real in the span of three heartbeats.\n\n*This is nonsense!*\n\nComparable to Braham's magic. No. More terrifying, because this wasn't arcane power. This was will made manifest through labor's tools.\n\nPiaro straightened, chest swelling.\n\n\"Imagine it.\" His voice carried the weight of revelation. \"What if a legendary farmer is marching with an army and circumstances lead to a food shortage? I can immediately clear a field and feed the soldiers!\"\n\nGrid's mouth hung open. He forced it shut.\n\n*No food shortages.* An army that could sustain itself anywhere. Strategic value beyond measure.\n\nBut.\n\n\"What if there is no water?\"\n\n\"Use the water from nearby rivers or have magicians summon water.\"\n\n\"What if there are no rivers or magicians?\"\n\n\"...It will rain.\"\n\n\"If it doesn't rain?\"\n\n\"Free Farming 5th Style, Harvest!\"\n\nThe sickle flashed.\n\nQi screamed through the air. The wheat stalks parted. Thousands of them. Tens of thousands. The entire field cut at once.\n\n\"Ack!\"\n\nGrid threw himself flat. Golden grain rained down around him, burying him in a blizzard of wheat. He clawed at the stalks covering his face.\n\n*This is too unnecessary!*\n\nThen the world exploded.\n\nThe wheat ignited. Every single stalk. Detonating in a chain reaction that turned the field into a crematorium.\n\n\"Kuaaaaak!\"\n\nHeat seared Grid's skin. The God Hands snapped into formation around him, a barrier of golden palms absorbing the brunt of the blast. Without them, he'd be ash. His health bar plummeted anyway.\n\n\"Kuk...! Ugh! Cough! Cough!\"\n\nScorched flour coated his armor. His throat burned from inhaling the smoke.\n\n\"How is there such a process in farming!?\"\n\nPiaro stood untouched in the center of the devastation, expression serene.\n\n\"It is polishing.\"\n\n\"What polishing!?\"\n\n*Polishing is removing the husk, not turning it into a weapon of mass destruction!*\n\nGrid bit back the words. Forced himself to focus.\n\n*I lost my composure.* He'd let himself get distracted by spectacle. Let Piaro dictate the flow. *Get it together.*\n\nHe needed to seize momentum. Force Piaro onto the defensive.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship, Transcended Link!\"\n\nTwenty blades of dark energy erupted from Iyarugt. They screamed toward Piaro from every angle, a net of death impossible to evade.\n\nGrid charged behind them. When Piaro blocked, Grid would be there. Waiting. Ready to exploit the opening.\n\n*Solid plan.*\n\nExcept the opponent was a monster.\n\nPiaro's body blurred. Natural State activated. He moved faster than Grid's eyes could track, faster than the energy blades themselves.\n\nThe flail whipped forward.\n\nIt looked casual. Lazy, even. Like he was dusting a shelf. But something scattered from each swing. Not dust. Something worse.\n\n\"Ugh! Kkuk! Keok! Kek!\"\n\nEach particle that touched Grid exploded. Microscopic detonations stripping away his health in chunks.\n\n[I can't read the trajectory!]\n\nIyarugt's voice carried genuine shock.\n\n*Useless!*\n\nBut Grid couldn't blame the sword. This was beyond both of them. Every skill. Every item. Every trick he'd accumulated. Useless against this wall.\n\nStill.\n\nHe hadn't played his final card.\n\n\"Piaro...! I'm not backing down yet!\"\n\nBehind him, the four God Hands hammered at a portable anvil. Sparks flew. Metal screamed.\n\nPiaro's eyes narrowed. *What is going on?*\n\n> [You have succeeded in combining Failure and Grid's Greatsword!]\n\nGrid grinned.\n\nThe God Hands shot forward, presenting the completed weapon. The merged blade was magnificent. Shark-teeth merged with crescent-edge. Power thrumming through every inch of folded metal.\n\nGrid slotted the Rune of Darkness into its core.\n\nBlack energy erupted. Demonic power wrapped around the blade, around Grid's blackened armor. Weapon and wielder in perfect synchronization.\n\nHe swung.\n\nPiaro's flail intercepted.\n\n*Peok!*\n\n\"Ugh.\"\n\n*So what if he had the strongest weapon in hand?* Grid couldn't land a blow. Quick Movements had expired. Piaro's Natural State made him untouchable. The flail struck again. Again. Grid's health plummeted toward the minimum threshold.\n\nHe lowered the greatsword.\n\n\"You as a farmer...!\" Blood ran from his split lip. \"Farmer! Ugh! I will recognize your path as a farmer!\"\n\n> [Your health has fallen to a minimum, so sparring mode is finished!]\n\n> [The hidden quest 'Lord's Confidence' has been completed.]\n\n> [Piaro's stats and skills will significantly rise.]\n\nLight enveloped Piaro. His level remained relatively low compared to ancient legends. But everything else. His foundation, his potential, his skills. Now they matched.\n\nA true legend had been born.\n\nGrid sat in the dirt, panting.\n\n\"Damn! I'm also a legend, but why am I in this shape?\"\n\nThe great demons. Braham. Marie Rose. Now Piaro. Too many mountains. Too many walls he couldn't scale.\n\n*I need to get stronger.*\n\nThe hunger burned in his gut. He refused to feel this helpless again. Refused to taste failure like ash in his mouth.\n\n*Control and agility.* Those were the keys. And the fastest way to grow both was obvious.\n\n*Hunting. Leveling.*\n\nBut first.\n\nGrid pushed himself to his feet. He had a responsibility to fulfill.\n\n---\n\nThe anvil rang for three days straight.\n\nGrid poured everything into the work. **Stamina**, **Dexterity**, **Concentration**. Each piece of farming equipment received the same care he'd give a legendary weapon. Because for Piaro, these *were* legendary weapons.\n\nThe hand plow. Sleek black iron reinforced with orichalcum veins. Perfect weight distribution.\n\nThe sickle. Curved blade sharp enough to cut wind. Handle wrapped in drake leather.\n\nThe flail. Three weights, each containing a compressed magic core. Capable of scattering explosive qi on command.\n\nThe hoe. The rake. The watering can.\n\nEvery tool of a farmer's trade, elevated to the realm of gods.\n\nAnd to hold them, six custom sheaths. Leather dyed the color of fertile soil, reinforced with steel bands. They hung at Piaro's waist like a swordsman's arsenal.\n\n\"Okay.\" Grid wiped sweat from his brow. Barely satisfied. Never truly satisfied, but good enough.\n\nHe joined the Pavranium Expedition. Dove into the vampire cities with renewed focus. The experience and item acquisition buff from his Duke title still had time remaining. He'd wring every drop of value from it.\n\nLevel 305.\n\nWhen he returned to Reidan, Irene's belly had swollen heavy with life. Less than a month until the birth.\n\n---\n\n## Epilogue\n\nChris stared.\n\nThe Five Captains stared.\n\nThey all stood in the practice field, hand plows forgotten in their grips, jaws slack.\n\nPiaro approached. Six sheaths hung at his waist. Gleaming leather. Polished steel bands. They looked like a master swordsman's equipment.\n\n*But why would he need sheaths?* Chris's brain struggled to process. *He's a farmer now. He uses farming equipment. So why...*\n\n*Wait.*\n\n*No.*\n\n*He's not holding knives.*\n\nPiaro cleared his throat. Drew himself up with obvious pride.\n\nHe gripped one of the sheaths. Drew the implement within with the flourish of a duelist unveiling a legendary blade.\n\nA rake.\n\nA gods-damned **rake**, pulled from a sheath like it was <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Excalibur</span>.\n\nFive more sheaths held five more tools. Hoe. Plow. Sickle. Flail. Watering can. All crafted to perfection. All housed in custom leather like holy relics.\n\nChris felt something stir in his chest.\n\nNot envy. Not quite. Something worse.\n\n*Want.*\n\nHe wanted sheaths like that. Wanted his farming equipment displayed with the same care. The same respect.\n\n*I'm third on the unified rankings.* The thought came unbidden, absurd. *Why am I jealous of farming equipment storage?*\n\nBut he was.\n\nGod help him, he was.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**  \n**OG:** [Glossary Link]  \n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
