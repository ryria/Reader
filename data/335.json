Her father was a prominent swordsman who wielded it skillfully. But she'd never seen aura shift and change like this, released from a sword. This wasn't aura at all. This was magic.\n\n*There are so many masters in this world!*\n\nShe stared at Hurent, accepting him as a master of a new realm. Awe filled her chest.\n\nThe blade of aura streaked toward her exposed neck. Piaro tsked and swung his hand plow up to intercept it.\n\nMetal rang against condensed energy.\n\n\"Not reacting when a blade comes for your neck is a convenient way to commit suicide.\"\n\nRoyman's face flushed. \"I-I'm really sorry!\"\n\nHer mind reeled. *That incredible aura... blocked by a hand plow?*\n\nShe'd known Piaro was strong, but this? He worked the fields every day. He didn't look special at all. Yet now...\n\n*Perhaps his strength surpasses even Asmophel's.*\n\n\"I will teach you to defend reflexively, even without two arms.\" Piaro pulled the hand plow back, inspecting its edge. \"We'll plant rice for three hours every day, starting tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nRoyman was sincerely grateful for her life being spared. This man would be her savior forever. But... planting rice?\n\n*This isn't a penalty game. What is he talking about?*\n\nPiaro, meanwhile, had his own confusion to wrestle with.\n\n*Is there another powerful enemy here?*\n\nDuring his time with the Red Knights, he'd carried out wars across the continent. He'd spent more nights sleeping on battlefields than in his own bed. Countless enemies. The champions of nations. He'd faced them all.\n\nYet the enemies arriving at this peaceful(?) Reidan were far more brilliant than those old foes. Truly remarkable.\n\n*Reidan attracts the strong.* Or perhaps it was simply a different era. Either way, Piaro enjoyed it. Each invasion was nourishment for the legendary farmer's growing power.\n\nHe turned to Hurent, caught up in this positive feeling. \"Your ability to control aura is remarkable. But it lacks strength.\"\n\n\"...Ah.\"\n\nHurent couldn't find happiness in a farmer praising his aura mastery.\n\n*However, his skills are real.*\n\nThat dirt-covered farmer had blocked his aura with a hand plow. No dream. All 2,000 soldiers witnessed it.\n\n*Were the rumors true?*\n\nHe'd heard tales of powerful farmers in Reidan. Whispers that farmers, not soldiers, had broken the seven guild alliance.\n\n*Of course, I thought it was nonsense.*\n\nNow it seemed accurate.\n\nHurent turned toward Bunny Bunny. The streamer held his camera high, filming everything. His excited expression made it clear he'd also heard the rumors about Reidan's farmers.\n\n*I can't take risks before meeting Grid.*\n\nHe was confident about getting revenge on Grid. He couldn't fall to some farmer. Hurent's eyes shifted to Royman.\n\n*I'll use him.*\n\nHis judgment and execution were swift. No unnecessary delays. Hurent closed his eyes to sharpen his concentration and activated Aura Impact.\n\n> **[You have released your aura.]**\n>\n> **[Accurately imagine the shape of the aura within 2 seconds. If there is even a small error in the image, the skill will fail.]**\n\nTen months of daily image training to bring out the true power of an Aura Master. Hurent's eyes snapped open.\n\n\"Dragon's Roar!\"\n\n> **[You have developed the breath of a dragon! By reproducing the power of a transcendent being, the power of your aura is greatly increased!]**\n>\n> **[There is a limit to the power that a unique rated aura can exert.]**\n\nThe ground exploded.\n\nHurent's aura blast erupted in a straight line. The violent energy tore through earth and whipped up a sandstorm, incomparable to the whip from before.\n\nPiaro's eyes widened. \"Impressive.\"\n\nWhen he'd been a great swordsman, he'd realized the absolute limits of aura. Yet this man before him had broken through those limits. A truly respectable achievement. Reaching a level Piaro himself never could.\n\n\"In honor of your talent, I will use my full power as well.\"\n\nPiaro couldn't afford to relax. To be precise, he had no room to spare. He needed to protect Royman, someone who would become a pillar of strength for his lord. The aura breath's power was massive and wide-ranging. He couldn't simply deflect it.\n\n\"Free Farming 4th Style.\"\n\nHis hand moved to his waist. One of six sheaths hung there. Piaro's fingers closed around a plow, one Grid had forged. The moment he drew it, power exploded through his body.\n\nThe strength of items.\n\n> **[All skills related to farming will increase by 20%.]**\n\n\"Plow the Field!\"\n\nThe plow struck earth.\n\nThe ground erupted upward like a tsunami.\n\n***\n\n*Incredible!*\n\nBunny Bunny, the world's top gaming streamer, aimed his camera at the whip-like aura. Hurent's control was extraordinary. But disappointment crashed through him when the shabby farmer blocked it with a hand plow.\n\n*A farmer blocked that skill?*\n\nAura Master Hurent. His aura was gorgeous but lacked substance. No wonder Grid defeated him in five seconds.\n\n*Instead of revenge, will he die in four seconds this time?*\n\nBunny Bunny's disappointment peaked. Then a thought struck him.\n\n*I heard rumors about a monster farmer in Reidan...*\n\nCould they be true?\n\n*A massive scoop!*\n\nThis was his chance to reveal the truth behind the rumors to the world. Excitement surged through him as he focused on filming. Hurent unleashed a tremendous skill reminiscent of a dragon's breath.\n\n*Amazing!*\n\nHurent's abilities were real. Too early to write him off. Sweat beaded on Bunny Bunny's forehead as he witnessed the breath's raw power. How would the rumored farmer handle this devastating technique?\n\n*Give me a spectacular battle scene to boost my viewership!*\n\nHis prayer shattered moments later.\n\n\"Another farming tool?\"\n\nThe hand plow vanished, replaced by a full-sized plow. This farmer, Piaro, showed no signs of delivering the brilliant combat Bunny Bunny craved. Actually, he'd been insane to expect anything spectacular in the first place.\n\nBunny Bunny's face fell.\n\n\"Free Farming 4th Style, Plowing the Field.\"\n\nThe plow struck again.\n\nEarth rose to meet Hurent's aura breath. The collision sent tremors through the desert. Simultaneously, the ground began transforming into cleared farmland.\n\n\"What... is this?\"\n\nBunny Bunny's camera captured a stunning sight. Streams of water erupted from the center of the newly cleared land.\n\n*This is the desert!*\n\nWater... in the desert? His cognitive abilities failed to process what he was seeing.\n\n\"Free Farming 1st Style, Sowing.\"\n\nSeeds rained down over the confused Bunny Bunny and 2,000 soldiers.\n\n*What is happening?*\n\nA sequence that resembled farming.\n\n*No, this is impossible.*\n\nNobody would be insane enough to start farming in front of 2,000 enemies.\n\n\"Free Farming 2nd Style, Rapid Growth.\"\n\nBunny Bunny's face drained of color. Thousands of seeds scattered across the ground began sprouting simultaneously.\n\n*This is insane!*\n\nHe'd wanted a spectacular battle scene, but got a farming documentary instead? Anger overwhelmed wonder as he stared at the desert transforming into rice paddies before his eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, Hurent was targeting Royman.\n\n***\n\nGrid examined the item in his hands.\n\n**Block Toys to Help a Child's Development**. Something he'd acquired from the Reputation Store. He'd initially dismissed it as useless, but watching Lord play with the blocks made him grateful he'd kept it.\n\n\"Abu. Abu.\"\n\nThe small baby sat on the bed, constructing a tower from the blocks. A crude but recognizable castle shape. A ten-day-old child building a castle?\n\nUnbelievable.\n\n\"A genius! The greatest genius on the continent!\"\n\nMarquis Steim's certainty was absolute. An objective assessment, not blinded by love.\n\nIrene smiled warmly. \"It's wonderful that his dexterity resembles my husband's. I think he'll become a master blacksmith.\"\n\nGrid returned her smile. \"He's just like you.\"\n\n\"Dear husband...\"\n\n\"Irene.\"\n\nTheir eyes filled with affection. The couple's love had deepened considerably since Lord's birth. Every night, the six hands...\n\n[Omitted.]\n\nNaturally, their bond grew stronger.\n\nMarquis Steim cleared his throat loudly. The couple had embraced each other, apparently forgetting his presence. \"What type of education are you planning to focus on for Lord?\"\n\nThe question triggered the childcare system.\n\n> **[Please select Lord's education.]**\n>\n> **[Lord's age is still young, so there are limited options to choose from.]**\n\n**Leave it until he is older. Basic academic education. Basic etiquette education.**\n\n*Don't rush this.*\n\nWhat education should he provide to a ten-day-old infant? Grid was about to select the first option when he paused.\n\n*Wait. If I think about it... isn't Lord's current intelligence double Jude's?*\n\nJude's maximum intelligence was set at 20. Lord was born with 48 intelligence. Despite his age, his brain was already developed enough for teaching. That's why basic academics and etiquette appeared as options.\n\n*But he's highly likely to become arrogant.*\n\nGrid considered carefully before deciding.\n\n\"I'll teach him etiquette. He was born with a gold spoon, but he shouldn't be overindulged.\"\n\nMarquis Steim nodded. \"Yes, good. Early education is crucial, especially for talented children.\"\n\nIrene's smile brightened. \"I support my husband's decision.\"\n\n> **[Lord's early education method has been selected. Your wife Irene will teach Lord.]**\n\nAt that moment, Grid noticed something.\n\nLord's face, which had been smiling happily, now looked like he wanted to complain.\n\n*Don't tell me... he doesn't want to study?*\n\nDid the baby actually understand their conversation?\n\n*I must be mistaken.*\n\nGrid was being too sensitive. He laughed it off.\n\n\"Lord has a strange expression. I think he needs a diaper change.\"\n\n\"Oh my, really?\"\n\nIrene checked and summoned a maid.\n\n***\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**\n\n**OG: Glossary Link.**\n\n**Current schedule: 20 chapters a week.**\n\n**Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
