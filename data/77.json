Sim Kiwan swallowed hard.\n\n*He must be high-level. Way higher than us. No wonder he can handle canyon spiders alone.*\n\nChoi Chansung's analytical mind churned. *If we could get to that level...*\n\nYoungwoo raised the glowing blade and swung. The spider web clinging to the cave wall parted like silk, fibers drifting to the stone floor. The same web they'd hacked at for ten minutes without leaving a scratch.\n\nJunho's eyes widened. *So easily...*\n\nYoungwoo shrugged, the gesture lazy. \"Anyone who can't break a spider web at this level is, honestly, quite incompetent and pathetic.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air.\n\nJunho's jaw tightened. Kiwan's face flushed red. Any other day, Junho would have exploded. Curses, threats, maybe a swing or two. But today, his limbs were wrapped in sticky webbing, and the man with the glowing weapon held all the cards.\n\nJunho forced his lips into a smile. The expression came out strained, servile. \"Haha, we're still low-level users. It's hard for us to deal with the spider webs. Please help us. If you don't, we won't be able to escape and we'll die here.\"\n\nYoungwoo watched the performance with barely concealed amusement.\n\n*This bastard. The same guy who strutted around school like he owned the world. Now look at him.*\n\nHe cupped his chin, the gesture theatrical. \"Hmm. Why should I save you? What's in it for me? I'm not big on charity work.\"\n\nThe helmet hid most of Youngwoo's face, but his tone made his intentions crystal clear. Junho's smile faltered.\n\n\"We spent most of our money on potions. We only have a little left.\"\n\n\"Don't lowball me.\" Youngwoo crossed his arms. \"Do you value your lives that cheaply?\"\n\n\"You know we don't have much. We're not high-level.\"\n\n\"Based on your equipment, you're at least level 80.\" Youngwoo gestured at their gear. \"Pool your money together. Should add up to something decent.\"\n\nJunho's voice took on a pleading edge. \"If we give you everything, how will we survive? Please, have mercy.\"\n\n*Mercy.*\n\nThe word sparked something in Youngwoo's chest. White-hot and vicious.\n\n*Mercy. Like you showed me mercy when you made me buy your lunch every day for two years. Like you had mercy when you held me down and made me apologize for breathing wrong.*\n\nHis fingers curled into fists.\n\n*Perfect. The universe hands me this gift, and I'm supposed to waste it?*\n\n\"You know what?\" Youngwoo's voice dropped. \"You're right. I should have mercy.\"\n\nJunho's shoulders sagged with relief.\n\n> **[Blacksmith's Rage has been activated.]**\n> **[Attack power and attack speed increased by 15% and 30% for 30 seconds.]**\n\nYoungwoo's fist shot forward.\n\nThe impact against Junho's stomach drove the air from his lungs. He doubled over as far as the webbing allowed, a strangled wheeze escaping his throat.\n\n\"What窶能"\n\nAnother punch. This one caught his jaw.\n\n\"Kuheok!\"\n\nJunho's head snapped back. Blood flecked his lips. His health bar, visible in the party window, dropped a visible chunk.\n\nKiwan's eyes went wide. *A warrior losing health that fast from bare fists?*\n\nYoungwoo shook out his knuckles. Seven hundred strength. Not even counting the rage buff. Against an unarmored target who'd dumped everything into offense, his hands were sledgehammers.\n\n\"W-what is this?\" Junho sputtered, eyes streaming.\n\nYoungwoo grinned. The expression felt savage on his face. \"You don't want to pay, but you still expect me to save you? That's some nerve.\"\n\nHis fist crashed into Junho's ribs.\n\n\"Kaack!\"\n\n\"You called your potions valuable.\" Another punch. \"So valuable you can't part with a single gold. But my time? My effort? That's worthless, right?\"\n\n\"N-no! Wait!\" Junho coughed, red spittle on his chin. \"If we give you money, you'll spare us? Why should I窶能"\n\n\"Weren't your potions valuable?\" Youngwoo's voice mocked. \"Or are you admitting they're trash?\"\n\n\"You want all our assets for cutting spider webs?\" The words came out garbled, pained.\n\n\"To me, they're just spider webs.\" Youngwoo leaned closer, his helmet inches from Junho's bloodied face. \"But for you? You can't break free. You'll die here.\"\n\nThe punches kept coming. Methodical. Measured. Each one calculated to hurt without killing outright.\n\nJunho's health dropped to sixty percent. Then fifty.\n\n\"I understand! Sorry! I made a mistake!\" The words tumbled out in a rush. \"Please! I'll give you everything!\"\n\nYoungwoo stepped back, tilting his head. \"That's okay.\"\n\nHope flickered across Junho's bruised features. \"Huh?\"\n\n\"I don't want your money.\"\n\n\"It was a joke?\" Junho's laugh came out desperate, manic. \"Haha! You're funny. You were going to save us anyway, right?\"\n\n\"Save you?\" Youngwoo's tone turned flat. \"Who said that?\"\n\n\"But I said I'd give you everything窶能"\n\n\"How do I know you mean it?\" Youngwoo examined his knuckles. \"You could have a hundred gold. Give me one. Say 'Sorry, this is all I have.' What then?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't do that!\"\n\n\"Right.\" Youngwoo nodded slowly. \"Well, here's the thing. Even if you gave me everything... I still wouldn't save you.\"\n\nSilence. Then: \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I hate rude people.\"\n\nThe beating resumed.\n\nThis time Youngwoo didn't hold back. His fists blurred, each impact punctuated by Junho's screams. The warrior's health plummeted.\n\nKiwan watched, face pale. *Junho invested everything in strength. His base health should be massive. But he's taking this much damage from bare hands?*\n\nHis throat went dry. *How strong is this guy?*\n\n\"Hey!\" Kiwan found his voice. \"Why are you beating people who asked for help? We didn't do anything wrong!\"\n\nYoungwoo stopped mid-swing. His head turned, slow and deliberate.\n\nKiwan flinched.\n\nThe eyes behind the helmet slots didn't look human. They shone with something bright and hungry, like a starving animal that had just spotted prey.\n\nYoungwoo moved. Three steps, and he was in front of Kiwan.\n\nHis fist found Kiwan's jaw.\n\n\"Kuack!\"\n\nMagicians had less health than warriors. After ten minutes of sustained beating, Kiwan's bar dropped to half. Blood ran from his nose, his lip, a cut above his eye. He wanted to curse, to scream, but the words died in his throat every time those eyes fixed on him.\n\n\"S-spare me...\" The plea came out broken.\n\nYoungwoo's laugh echoed off the cave walls. \"What? Spare you? Hahahaha! You want to live? Do you? Do you want to live?\"\n\nHe punctuated each question with another blow.\n\n\"I'll keep going then!\"\n\n\"Aagh!\"\n\nChansung watched it all. His expression remained neutral, analytical, even as his friends were brutalized three meters away.\n\n*A PKer. Has to be. But why here? Why us?*\n\nHis mind raced through possibilities. The odds of running into a dedicated player-killer in the middle of nowhere were astronomically low. This felt personal.\n\n*Does he know us?*\n\n\"Do it in moderation.\" Junho's voice cut through the sound of fists on flesh.\n\nYoungwoo paused. He turned, Kiwan's blood still wet on his knuckles.\n\n\"What did you just say?\"\n\nJunho's eyes blazed with killing intent. The webbing held his body, but his spirit flared to life. \"I said do it moderately, you bastard!\"\n\nThe roar filled the cave.\n\nKiwan's swollen eyes found Junho. *Yes! That's it! Show him!*\n\nThis was the Junho they knew. The one who didn't bow. The one who'd thrown hands with seniors twice his size and walked away grinning. The mad dog who feared nothing.\n\nYoungwoo walked over, steps slow and measured. \"Loud for someone stuck in a web. What are you, a dog barking behind a fence?\"\n\nHe drove his fist into Junho's stomach.\n\n\"If I don't stop, what are you going to do about it?\"\n\nAnother punch. Then another.\n\n\"Try breaking free before you raise your voice, you incompetent bastard.\"\n\nThe blows rained down. Junho struggled against the webbing, muscles straining, veins bulging in his neck. The threads held firm.\n\nHis health dropped to thirty percent.\n\nJunho stopped fighting. He fixed Youngwoo with a glare that could peel paint. \"Where do you live?\"\n\nYoungwoo's fist paused.\n\n\"Tell me where you live.\" Junho's voice shook, but not with fear. With rage. \"Do you want to meet me in reality? I'll kill you. Give me an address. Right now.\"\n\nFor a moment, instinct overrode logic. Youngwoo's shoulders tensed. The same old fear, muscle memory from a hundred confrontations in school hallways.\n\nThen he remembered. Junho didn't know who he was. Couldn't know.\n\nYoungwoo laughed. \"Me? I live in Argentina, you bastard.\"\n\nArgentina. The eighth largest country on Earth. Population less than South Korea despite the size. Famous for soccer. For asado. For being literally on the opposite side of the planet.\n\nHis fist found Junho's face again.\n\nThe fight went out of Junho like air from a punctured tire. \"I'm sorry. I was wrong, please stop.\"\n\nThe voice came out small. Broken.\n\n\"I couldn't see my situation. I'm really sorry. Please spare me. I'll really die...\"\n\nYoungwoo stood over him, breathing hard. *There it is. There's the real you.*\n\nStrong against the weak. Weak before the strong. The pattern held true whether in school corridors or spider-infested caves.\n\n\"Bark like a dog.\" Youngwoo's voice came out cold. \"Call me master. Then I'll save you.\"\n\n\"R-really?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Okay. I'll do it. Ba窶能"\n\n\"Junho.\" Chansung's voice cut across the cave. \"Are you really going to do this?\"\n\nJunho's mouth snapped shut.\n\nChansung met Youngwoo's gaze without flinching. \"Is there a problem with dying once? And is there any guarantee he'll spare you even if you obey?\"\n\nYoungwoo studied him. *So this is where the spine is. Chansung. Always the quiet one. The one pulling strings from the back.*\n\nThe realization settled over him like cold water.\n\n*You were the real boss all along. Junho was just the weapon.*\n\nHe moved in front of Chansung. Raised his fist.\n\nThe first blow split Chansung's lip. Blood ran down his chin. He smiled through it.\n\n\"Yes. Kill us.\" The words came out steady. \"Being killed by a madman is better than being eaten by spiders or logging out.\"\n\nYoungwoo's hand froze mid-swing.\n\n*This bastard...*\n\nHe hadn't planned to kill them. Just hurt them. Humiliate them. Make them beg and grovel until every slight, every cruel word, every moment of powerlessness was paid back in full.\n\nBut Chansung refused to break.\n\n\"You... you're not afraid to die?\" Youngwoo grabbed Chansung's collar. \"Your experience will drop. You'll lose items. It'll hurt.\"\n\n\"Being ashamed to beg is worse than pain.\" Chansung's smile didn't waver. \"Kill me. Do what you want.\"\n\nYoungwoo released him, stepping back.\n\n*Fuck. This isn't working. I wanted them broken, not playing martyr.*\n\nJunho and Kiwan watched the exchange. They glanced at each other.\n\nKiwan lowered his voice to a whisper. \"Did you see that? The crazy bastard stopped when Chansung challenged him.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Junho's eyes narrowed. \"Maybe he's one of those psychos who only enjoys it when people beg. If you ask for death, he loses interest.\"\n\n\"That's it!\"\n\nThey both straightened, voices ringing out in unison.\n\n\"That's right! Kill us!\" Junho shouted. \"I'd rather die than grovel!\"\n\n\"We're not afraid!\" Kiwan added.\n\nYoungwoo stood frozen, mind racing.\n\n*Shit. What now? Do I actually kill them? No. PKer penalties. Reputation loss. Prison time. Damn it.*\n\nThe silence stretched.\n\nFinally, he exhaled. \"Whatever. I'm done here.\"\n\nHe turned and walked toward the cave mouth.\n\n\"Do what you want. Starve to death in those webs for all I care.\"\n\nHis footsteps echoed. Then faded.\n\nJunho stared at the empty tunnel. \"This wasn't what we wanted.\"\n\n\"There was no guarantee he'd save us,\" Kiwan said slowly. \"But at least he might have. Now we're just... stuck.\"\n\nThe math was simple. Starve to death slowly, or log out and take the suicide penalty. Either way, they died.\n\nJunho's face twisted. \"Why did he even beat us up if he wasn't going to kill us? What was the point?\"\n\nThe shame would stick. The memory of begging. Of almost barking like a dog. That would last longer than any lost experience or dropped items.\n\nOutside the cave, Youngwoo scanned the darkness.\n\n\"No spiders around.\" He kicked a rock, watched it bounce down the canyon slope. \"If I could find one, drag it back... let them have the full experience.\"\n\nThe thought made him grin.\n\nHe ran through the canyon, searching. But canyon spiders were ambush predators. Territorial. The odds of finding one wandering loose, let alone capturing it alive, were effectively zero.\n\nAfter an hour, he gave up.\n\n*They probably starved by now anyway.*\n\nLater, under moonlight that turned the rocks silver, Grid threw back his head.\n\n\"I missed the perfect revenge! Damn it!\"\n\nThe shout rang through the canyon. Monsters stirred.\n\nFive canyon wolves came loping out of the darkness, eyes reflecting torchlight, fangs bared.\n\n\"Bark bark! Bark!\"\n\nGrid raised his glowing weapon. \"Shut up, you dog scum!\"\n\nThe fight was brutal but brief. Five corpses steamed in the cool night air when it was done. Grid butchered one, roasted the meat over a hastily built fire.\n\nHe chewed slowly, watching embers rise.\n\n*Level 92 now. Not bad for a night's work.*\n\n\"Late anyway. I'll finish the quest tomorrow.\"\n\nThe north cliff was close. Another day, maybe two.\n\nHe kicked dirt over the fire and started back toward safer ground, leaving the wolves for the scavengers.\n\n---"
