Unlocks sword dances: Wave, Restraint, Link, Kill.**\n\n**• Passive bonuses are suspended during activation**\n\n**• Activation Cost: 20 Mana**\n\n**• 10-second cooldown after deactivation]**\n\nThis was the foundation of Grid's devastating basic attacks and his 100,000 Army Massacre Sword. While the active sword dances suffered from sluggish startup frames and lengthy cooldowns, the passive component was extraordinary—superior even to conventional weapon masteries. True, most masteries were always active, but Grid already possessed Weapons Mastery alongside Pagma's Swordsmanship. The redundancy didn't bother him.\n\n*What if I enhanced this instead?*\n\nInitially, Grid had planned to upgrade Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle. He'd never considered improving Pagma's Swordsmanship itself. The skill was so fundamental—serving as both conditional passive and gateway to his sword dances—that he took it for granted. Like air. Essential, omnipresent, easily forgotten.\n\nBut when he'd used the Goddess' Blessing on Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship, a question had surfaced: What would happen if he enhanced production skills like Blacksmith's Breath? That idle thought had sparked a revelation.\n\n*This could be brilliant.*\n\nGrid had no interest in upgrading Link, Kill, or Transcend individually. Yes, their power would increase, but their cooldowns would lock at thirty minutes—an eternity in combat. That wasn't enhancement; it was a lateral move at best, possibly even a net loss in sustained damage output.\n\n*Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle would drop from three hours to thirty minutes, but...*\n\nThirty minutes was still prohibitive. The fusion skill was reserved for raid bosses, not regular hunting or PvP. Whether the cooldown was three hours or thirty, you'd still only use it once, maybe twice per engagement.\n\n*But enhancing the passive itself...*\n\nThat would amplify everything—every sword dance, every fusion skill, including Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle. And perhaps, just perhaps, eliminate those cooldown penalties entirely.\n\n*Might even unlock new fusion combinations.*\n\nThough that was wishful thinking. No guarantees.\n\n\"Steady...\"\n\nGrid exhaled slowly, tempering his rising excitement. Hope was the mother of disappointment. He checked whether the Goddess' Blessing could even target Pagma's Swordsmanship, silently praying: *Please work. Please don't give me some bullshit message about incompatible skill types—*\n\n**Ding~!**\n\nA new window materialized.\n\n**[Great Swordsman Pagma's Swordsmanship]**\n\n**• Physical Attack +40%, Critical Hit Rate +50%, Critical Damage +80%**\n\n**• Effect applies only with sword-type weapons equipped**\n\n**• Footwork requirements for sword dances reduced by 50%**\n\n**• Unlocks sword dances: Wave, Restraint, Link, Kill**\n\n**• Enhanced skill permanently set to Master level**\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nGrid blinked. Read it again. His face twisted.\n\nThe description was *shorter*. No distinction between active and passive states. No mana costs listed. It looked... broken?\n\n\"No, wait. What the hell? This is completely—\"\n\nFor Grid, Pagma's Swordsmanship had always been a skill with strings attached. Powerful, certainly—legendary skills were supposed to be—but his experience with production classes had taught him that non-combat legendaries came with hard limits. For one terrible moment, seeing this streamlined description, he thought he'd ruined it.\n\nThen his brain caught up to his eyes.\n\n\"—ruined? Wait. Wait, this is *insane*.\"\n\nThe bonuses were permanent. Always active. No toggling required.\n\n*Forty percent increased attack power. All the time.*\n\nAnd the critical damage—his \"Death in One Shot!\" title already boosted critical damage significantly, and now it could reach 400%. Regular players sat around 150-210%. He'd be hitting twice as hard on crits.\n\n*If God's Command procs on top of that...*\n\nCould he one-shot a named boss? Not a field boss—an actual *named* boss monster?\n\n\"C-Crazy. This is absolutely insane!\"\n\nThe words tumbled out, his vocabulary reduced to awed repetition like a broken record. But he couldn't stay dumbstruck forever. Grid shook himself, mind clearing, and called out: \"Anyone there?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\" The response was immediate.\n\nMercedes stood at the smithy entrance, ever vigilant.\n\n\"That former Red Knight Asmophel brought back—Singuled, was it?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"What was his rank?\"\n\n\"Third Knight.\"\n\n\"And his skill?\"\n\n\"Exceptional. I haven't seen him in twelve years, but I'm certain he's kept his edge.\"\n\n\"Perfect.\" Grid's smile sharpened. \"Time to see what a former Red Knight can do.\"\n\n***\n\nSinguled sat in a dim chamber within the Overgeared Kingdom's castle, awaiting whatever fate his new liege would decree. The years since his disgrace had weathered him, but his sword arm remained strong. When Mercedes arrived with the summons, he followed without question.\n\nGrid met him in a private training yard, expression unreadable.\n\n\"Singuled. You served as Third Knight of the Red Knights.\"\n\n\"I did, Your Majesty.\" Singuled's voice was steady despite his uncertainty.\n\n\"Mercedes speaks highly of your abilities. I'd like to verify that personally.\" Grid drew his blade, Failure crackling with blue-white energy. \"No holding back.\"\n\nThis was no mere spar. Grid needed to test his evolved skill against a genuine threat—and Singuled, whatever his current state, had once stood among the empire's finest.\n\nThe former Red Knight's eyes widened fractionally before hardening with resolve. \"...As you command, Your Majesty.\"\n\nFor the record, Mercedes hadn't exaggerated. Singuled was formidable. During his active years, he'd actually surpassed Asmophel in pure combat prowess—held back from higher rank only by inferior leadership skills and lack of noble backing. Mercedes watched from the sidelines, a knowing smile on her lips.\n\nShe'd seen Grid's pattern of growth. Each adventure, each challenge pushed him to new heights. This test would reveal just how far he'd climbed this time.\n\nAnd secretly, she was excited to see it.\n\n***\n\n**Meanwhile, across the kingdom...**\n\nOrange light flared as Haster's shield repelled another aura strike. The Red Sage's defensive technique was uniquely suited to countering Hurent's style—it nullified attacks classified as skills, and aura-based assaults fell squarely into that category.\n\nYet Hurent's expression remained serene. Confident.\n\n\"Just gathering data,\" he said casually.\n\nThen his movements blurred.\n\n**Super Sensitivity** activated. Hurent's blade became a silver hurricane, each strike threading through the shield's gaps with surgical precision. Blood misted the air as shallow cuts opened across Haster's torso, arms, face. The Aura Master's sword hummed a deadly song.\n\n\"I started like everyone else,\" Hurent continued, his tone conversational despite the violence. \"Typical warrior build, standard progression. Then I learned about the Sword Saint.\"\n\nThe legendary combat class. The moment Hurent heard about it, he became obsessed. He researched every rumor, every hint about the qualification requirements. The consensus pointed toward ultimate mastery of Sword Mastery—so Hurent had sealed away every sword skill in his arsenal except that one basic passive. He'd handicapped himself deliberately, hunting with nothing but basic attacks, enduring countless penalties and inefficiencies.\n\n\"Did that for months. Might've been ahead of Kraugel at the time—I was the first player to unlock Intermediate Sword Mastery.\"\n\nThe system had rewarded his dedication. Since Hurent fought with pure bladework, never touching his mana pool, the game granted him a new resource: **Aura**. Talent, effort, and a stroke of luck converged. Instead of Sword Saint, he'd unlocked something different but equally rare—the growth-type hidden class **Aura Master**.\n\nHaster's orange shield flickered. Not because it had absorbed its damage threshold—Hurent had simply recognized the duration was ending. The instant it vanished, his blade carved a deep line across Haster's chest.\n\n\"**Aura Swallowing.**\"\n\nHurent's ultimate technique manifested like twin serpents, coiling manifestations of killing intent that struck from both flanks simultaneously. The skill's damage was devastating: 9,900 on initial impact from each side, followed by physical restraint, then another 9,900 as the aura crushed inward. A specialized anti-player technique.\n\nHaster took it head-on, and Hurent's smile widened.\n\n*No resistance.*\n\n**Super Sensitivity** was the key—an active skill with severe restrictions, consuming 100% mana over six seconds, but during that window Hurent's agility spiked by 20% and he gained perfect prediction of every action within ten meters. At his peak, using this skill, Hurent approximated Kraugel's baseline capabilities. \n\nFor a Sword Saint, Super Sensitivity was inferior—it became a passive with reduced effects. But even the \"weakened\" version Kraugel now possessed was phenomenal.\n\n**[You have suffered 9,900 damage.]**\n\n**[You have suffered 9,900 damage.]**\n\n**[You have suffered 9,900 damage.]**\n\nHaster grunted as the aura constricted, health bar plummeting. His mind raced.\n\n*This doesn't make sense.*\n\nHe'd fought Kraugel several months ago, shortly after the man achieved Sword Saint. Kraugel had been terrifying even then. But Hurent—Hurent was *stronger*? How?\n\n*Kraugel reset to level one for his class advancement. His skills are still low-level. I can't judge his full strength yet, but still...*\n\nBefore confusion could fully set in, new notifications appeared.\n\n**[Knowledge of the Red Sage grants you Aura Resistance.]**\n\n**[All aura-based damage reduced by 30%.]**\n\n*There it is.*\n\nHaster—former pro gamer, current FPS legend—hadn't been caught off-guard. He'd *let* himself get hit, gambling that his unique class trait would adapt mid-combat. Growth through adversity. He downed a potion, red liquid vanishing as his health bar stabilized, then reactivated his orange shield and burst free of the aura's grasp.\n\nHurent would be vulnerable now. Super Sensitivity drained mana completely—six seconds of prescience in exchange for complete exhaustion. Haster knew this because his mentor had taught him. The skill wasn't even that rare among modern Red Knights. The 19th Knight, Fulito, used it—the same Fulito that Grid had demolished.\n\n\"Hold on. Stop.\"\n\n\"—!?\"\n\n\"—!\"\n\nBoth combatants froze. A figure had appeared between them without warning—black hair, sharp features, predatory eyes. Recognition was instant.\n\n\"Apologies for the interruption,\" the man said, tone oddly courteous. \"I'm Grid. I need you both to pause for a moment.\"\n\n\"...??\"\n\nHurent's skin crawled. This was *wrong*. Grid—the same Grid who'd been a belligerent ass since the 1st National Competition—was being... polite? Respectful? The cognitive dissonance was jarring, almost disturbing.\n\nGrid smiled pleasantly. \"Your fight has caused significant property damage. Before you continue, could you determine who's responsible for compensation?\"\n\n***\n\nThe change wasn't random. After his confrontation with God Hexetia, Grid had experienced an epiphany about confidence and maturity. Respecting others wasn't weakness. Courtesy wasn't cowardice. His previous persona—the abrasive, chip-on-shoulder Grid—had stemmed from insecurity. He'd acted tough because he was afraid people would mock him otherwise.\n\n*I thought being polite meant being a pushover.*\n\n\"Uh... hello,\" Hurent managed, thrown completely off-balance by the civil tone. \"I... apologize for the damage?\"\n\n\"Y-yes, excuse us as well...\" Haster stammered.\n\nThe awkward atmosphere stretched. Then Haster's tactical instincts overrode his confusion—Hurent was still exhausted, vulnerable. He lunged.\n\nHis sword never connected.\n\n**[Durability of Winfred's Sword decreased by 43.]**\n\nGrid had interposed his own blade with **Drop**, a technique he'd deliberately hidden during his battle with the clone. The overhead strike generated immense force, and Haster's wrist screamed in protest as the shock traveled up his arm.\n\n*An instant-cast skill?* Haster's eyes widened.\n\nGrid's smile remained, but an edge crept into his voice. \"Are you testing me because I'm being nice?\"\n\n\"I—I apologize. I'll stand down.\"\n\nWhat was happening? Why were they both acting like scolded children? Hurent and Haster exchanged bewildered glances, utterly overwhelmed by this mature, composed version of Grid.\n\nThe man who stood between them wasn't the crude brawler they remembered. This Grid radiated quiet authority—the confidence of someone who no longer needed to prove anything."
