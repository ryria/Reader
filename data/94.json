Women draped themselves over my arms—dozens of them. Jishuka. Laella. Even Ahyoung, my first love.\n\n\"What about Yura?\"\n\nThe question cut through my fantasy.\n\nI blinked. Yura stood before me, arms crossed. She was... unrealistically beautiful. The kind of beauty that made everything else fade into background noise. Even Ahyoung, whom I'd pined after for ten years, seemed plain in comparison.\n\nBut Yura's chest was only slightly above average. *Probably a pushup bra. Maybe she's actually average.*\n\n\"You're not glamorous enough to be here.\"\n\nThe words left my mouth before I could stop them.\n\nHer face turned to ice.\n\n*Shit.*\n\n\"Wait—\"\n\nNo mercy came from the Blood Witch.\n\nThe dagger pierced my heart.\n\nPain exploded through my chest. I choked on blood. \"Killing someone so... casually. You really are... the Blood Witch.\"\n\nCruel woman.\n\n---\n\nI jerked awake with a strangled gasp.\n\nThe familiar sight of my dirty ceiling greeted me. The stained plaster. The water damage in the corner. My small, cramped bed with its thin mattress.\n\n*A dream.* Part of it had been good. The richest man in the world, beautiful women hanging off me. But Yura had killed me in the end.\n\nI rubbed my face. *That raid... I might never get another chance like that.*\n\nForty million won. Cash. From a single raid. Sure, I'd dumped money into consumables and the time investment was brutal, but raids paid better than hoping for random item drops. At least, top-tier raids did.\n\n*The Tzedakah Guild.*\n\nThey'd been attempting the Guardian of the Forest raid months ago when I first saw them. They and the other top guilds gobbled up raid profits, accumulating wealth I could barely imagine.\n\nA different world from mine.\n\n*But I got involved with them.* My stomach growled. *That was amazing.*\n\nI glanced at the clock. Noon. Wearing only boxers, I scratched my belly and shuffled toward the living room.\n\nSehee glanced up from the kitchen where she was preparing rice. Her face twisted in disgust. \"You don't have a good body. Why do you keep exposing yourself?\"\n\nI yawned.\n\n\"Think about how other people feel.\" She gestured at my torso. \"Look at how gaunt your stomach is. Don't take off your clothes in front of women.\"\n\n\"Why are you home? Shouldn't you be at school?\"\n\n\"Anniversary of the school's founding.\" She set down a bowl. \"Come eat lunch. Or breakfast, I guess.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nMy little sister was cooking for me? I sat at the table, expectant.\n\nThen I stared at the empty space beside the rice.\n\n\"What? Where are the side dishes?\"\n\n\"You want side dishes?\" Sehee raised an eyebrow. \"Our family still has a debt of 560 million won. Plus monthly interest. Just be grateful we can eat rice.\"\n\nMy chest tightened. I reached across the table and grabbed the chopsticks from her hand.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nI stood up. \"We're going out. To eat meat!\"\n\nMy sister was still growing. She couldn't survive on plain rice.\n\n\"If you keep eating like this, you'll—you'll waste away!\"\n\n\"I'm fine.\" She tried to grab her chopsticks back. \"Why should we eat meat when we should be saving?\"\n\n\"Sehee.\" I grinned. \"Your brother earned forty million won yesterday. So don't worry. Let's go!\"\n\nShe froze. \"Forty million? Cash?\"\n\n\"Yes! In one day! Isn't that great? Now come on!\"\n\nI dragged my stunned sister from the kitchen. I threw on the blue sweatpants that had been my favorite for a decade. By the time I finished dressing, Sehee had changed into a pretty outfit, ready to go.\n\n\"You know, for my sister, you're actually pretty.\"\n\n*How long has it been since I bought her a meal? This might be the first time.* \n\nPride swelled in my chest. I hummed as we left, riding four stops on the bus to a downtown area packed with restaurants.\n\nPeople stared at Sehee as we walked.\n\n\"Wow, really pretty. Her proportions are amazing. Is she an idol trainee?\"\n\n\"A perfect example of innocent beauty. Was there someone like this in the neighborhood?\"\n\n\"But who's that scruffy guy next to her? Surely she's not dating someone like that?\"\n\n\"What nonsense. Do they look like they'd be in the same social circle? Probably just walking near each other by coincidence.\"\n\n\"Right, that makes sense.\"\n\n\"Maybe... family?\"\n\nThe conversation died.\n\nSehee was beautiful, and I looked nothing like her. Personally, I thought she was prettier than even Yura. She was smart, sociable, and despite being cold to me, she was the pride of our family.\n\nWhich made me reluctant to go anywhere with her in public.\n\n*I'm harming her image just by existing.*\n\nI slowed my pace, letting distance open between us. She'd be less embarrassed if we didn't walk together.\n\nSehee grabbed my arm.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" She pulled me forward. \"Why are you trying to go alone?\"\n\n\"Just... Everyone's staring. You should let go.\"\n\nThe distrust on people's faces was palpable. Like I was threatening her. Like someone was about to call the police.\n\nSehee pressed closer. \"I hate walking alone. Men won't stop trying to talk to me.\" She squeezed my arm. \"This is prevention. Besides, you give off such a sketchy vibe that it actually helps.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nWe stopped in front of a Hanwoo specialty store. The kind of place where you didn't enter unless you were willing to spend 250,000 won per person.\n\n*I never thought I'd come to a place like this.* \n\nThanks to Satisfy. The game had brought me here, to lunch at a restaurant like this. My eyes stung.\n\nSehee stopped me at the door. \"We're not actually eating here, right?\"\n\n\"Didn't I say I earned forty million won? I wasn't joking. Don't you believe me?\"\n\n\"I believe you.\" She bit her lip. \"I know you're doing well in Satisfy these days. But can you make forty million won every day?\"\n\n\"Well... no. Sometimes I don't earn anything. But there might be days when I earn even more. This isn't a burden. Just go inside.\"\n\n\"Listen.\" She grabbed my sleeve. \"It's not certain when you'll earn good money again. It's more important to save. And I like pork more than beef anyway.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I tugged her toward the door. \"When will you ever get to eat something like this? I've always wanted to come here. Just trust me for once. Come on!\"\n\nI held her wrist and pulled her inside.\n\n\"Welcome.\"\n\nThe employee's greeting was polite, but his expression soured when he looked at me. Old-fashioned. Poor. Then his gaze shifted to Sehee's bright appearance and his face changed.\n\n\"Just the two of you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"This way.\"\n\nHe guided us to a private room. On the way, I glimpsed a lit-up hall filled with people. Cameras. Lights. Some kind of interview for a TV show, maybe.\n\n*A celebrity?*\n\nSehee sat and looked around at the elegant interior. She sighed.\n\n\"I wish I could've come to a place like this with our parents.\"\n\n\"You're a good daughter.\" I picked up the menu. \"Don't worry. I'll take them somewhere even better.\"\n\n\"Oh, look at you being a good son.\"\n\nHer face lit up.\n\nThat day, brother and sister ate the finest Hanwoo that melted in their mouths.\n\n---\n\n\"So finally...\" The reporter leaned forward. \"People around the world are curious. Yura, is it true that you're the new Eighth Servant? Most people are convinced.\"\n\nYura sat across from the Satisfy media representatives, struggling to focus. The interview location was a Hanwoo store, and the smell was distracting. Then a couple entered.\n\nShe recognized the man immediately.\n\n*Grid.*\n\nThe first person to ever defeat her in combat. After the incident at the Yatan Temple, Yura had tried to learn who Grid was. Research turned up nothing. Yet here he was, in reality, in Korea.\n\n*I never thought I'd meet him again.*\n\nHeat crept into her cheeks. She smiled. The encounter at the temple had been... intense. Memorable. She'd dreamed of reuniting with him.\n\n\"Let's move to the next question—\"\n\nThe reporters and staff fell silent, staring at her sudden, alluring expression.\n\nYura stood. \"I need a break.\"\n\nShe left the restaurant and pulled out her phone, calling the informant she'd worked with since starting Satisfy.\n\n\"I'm sending you my current location. I want detailed information on a man dining here right now. His description is...\"\n\n---\n\n\"I can't... breathe. My stomach is too full.\"\n\nOn the bus home, I gasped and clutched my swollen belly.\n\nSehee suggested, \"Should we walk in the park? Help with digestion?\"\n\n\"What? Why would we digest the best Korean beef? It should stay in my stomach as long as possible.\"\n\nShe gave me a look. \"Right.\"\n\n\"Huh? What's with that face? You look upset.\"\n\n\"I'm fine. Just... there's a strong garlic smell.\"\n\nAwkward silence settled between us. My basic phone rang in my pocket.\n\n*Shit.* Was it a debt reminder call? I'd dealt with Mother's Heart is Happy Financial Services enough times to recognize the anxiety. Unknown number.\n\nThen I remembered.\n\n*I paid off my debt.* \n\nI wasn't a debtor anymore. Father's debt was different. I didn't have to fear unknown numbers.\n\nI answered with confidence. \"Hello?\"\n\nA voice I would never forget spoke from the other end.\n\n[Is this Shin Youngwoo's phone?]\n\nAhyoung. My first and only love, Kim Ahyoung.\n\nMy voice trembled. \"Yes... Is this Ahyoung?\"\n\n[That's right.] Her tone was bright. [You still remember my voice? Youngwoo is so attentive. I like that.]\n\n*I could never forget this voice.* My head buzzed. Nerves locked up my throat.\n\n\"What's... going on?\"\n\n*Why am I being so pathetic?* My first love was calling me, and instead of greeting her properly, I was asking stupid questions.\n\n[I was looking through our graduation album recently.] She paused. [While looking at the photos, I suddenly wanted to see you. After graduating high school, we've only met at alumni gatherings, right? How about it? Want to get a drink with me?]\n\nShe wanted to see me. Ahyoung wanted to have drinks.\n\n*Does she like me too? Is she finally going to confess?*\n\nI shot to my feet. \"When should we meet?\"\n\nThe bus stopped at that moment. I fell and rolled across the floor, but I felt no pain or shame.\n\n[Now would be good. But did you drop something? What was that sound?]\n\n\"Nothing! Nothing at all!\" I scrambled upright. \"You want to meet now? Actually, how about evening? Seven? Is that okay?\"\n\n[Yes, that's fine. Then at 7 p.m...]\n\nWe agreed on a meeting place. Ahyoung ended the call.\n\nMy heart pounded.\n\nSatisfy had changed my life so fast. No more creditors. And now, winning over my first love. It felt like a dream. Like I was floating on clouds.\n\n\"Was that a girl?\" Sehee asked.\n\nI hugged my phone, not looking at her. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are you meeting her?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\nWe didn't speak again until we got home. I was completely consumed by thoughts of meeting Ahyoung. Sehee kept her mouth shut.\n\nI showered the moment we got home, then knocked on Sehee's door.\n\n\"Sehee, recommend some fashionable styles. Actually, come buy clothes with me right now. Please help me look good.\"\n\n\"I have to study.\"\n\nThe door slammed shut.\n\n\"So cold.\"\n\nSehee locked herself in to focus on studying. I was forced to go shopping alone. With the clerk's help, I bought trendy clothes and went to a hair salon for a modern cut.\n\nWhen I stepped back onto the street, I saw people dressed in the same style as me.\n\n*Mass production.*\n\nIt didn't feel good, having the same look as everyone else. Honestly, it was embarrassing. But wasn't it a thousand times better than wearing decade-old sweatpants?\n\n*I've never dressed up before. Following trends is all I can do.*\n\nI comforted myself and ran toward the meeting place.\n\n---"
