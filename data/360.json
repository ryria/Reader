  "content": "# Chapter 360\n\nKim Doohyun was thirty-one years old.\n\nKorea's top star possessed a face that sold magazines and acting chops that had cracked Hollywood. Between film shoots and interviews, he carved out time for Satisfy. Now, after weeks of grinding, the desert city of Reidan sprawled before him.\n\nHis character, Nyangmong, had just hit level 197. The journey across the scorching desert had nearly broken him. Scorpions the size of dogs. Sand wyrms that erupted from dunes without warning. Heat that turned his vision into a shimmering haze.\n\n*If I'd rolled a common class, I'd still be stuck in that hellscape.*\n\nPet Master. A unique class that let him command nine creatures instead of the standard three. The temporary charm skill had turned potential threats into bodyguards. The desert monsters were strong, but none could match his menagerie.\n\nStill, nothing had prepared him for farmers.\n\nThe rice fields began at Reidan's outer walls and stretched to the horizon. Endless green rows rippling in waves. The scale defied reason.\n\n*Grid owns all of this. A duke's authority... it's beyond anything I imagined.*\n\nRespect kindled in his chest. Anyone who reached the top of their field earned that much. Grid was younger, sure, but age meant nothing in the face of achievement.\n\n*He must've bled for this. Just like I did.*\n\nDoohyun had clawed his way up through a thousand auditions, a thousand rejections. He recognized the shape of that struggle in what Grid had built.\n\nHis footsteps were light on the dirt path between the fields. He hummed, thoughts drifting to Noe. Soon he'd meet the little Memphis, maybe even convince Grid to let him pet it.\n\nA figure stepped onto the path ahead.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nDoohyun stopped. The man wore simple farmer's clothes, dirt under his nails, a hand plow slung across his back. Nothing about the scene warranted the edge in that question.\n\n\"I'm called Nyangmong...\"\n\nThe farmer's gaze swept over him. Then it moved to the nine pets trailing in his wake. A drake. Two spirit wolves. A jade serpent. The man's eyes narrowed with something that looked like hunger.\n\n\"I covet your talent.\" The farmer's voice was flat. \"Those giant oaks could be used for farming.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The giant oaks.\" He pointed at the two treants lumbering at the back of Doohyun's pet formation. \"They can be used for farming.\"\n\n*Is this guy serious?*\n\n\"I'm not a farmer. I need to get to Reidan.\" Doohyun stepped to the side, trying to move around the man.\n\nThe farmer shifted, blocking the path again. \"You aren't permitted to enter Reidan without my permission.\"\n\n\"Why would I need your permission? Are you the lord here?\"\n\n\"The owner of this land is Duke Grid.\"\n\n\"Then why—\"\n\n\"It's my heart.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air like a bad joke. Doohyun's confusion curdled into something closer to alarm. The farmer's expression hadn't changed. Dead serious. Absolutely insane.\n\n*This guy's out of his mind.*\n\nDoohyun turned and ran.\n\nHe made it five steps before the farmer appeared in front of him. *How?* There'd been no sound, no blur of movement. One moment the path was clear. The next, the man stood there with his hand plow raised.\n\n\"Wait, we can talk about this—\"\n\nThe plow came down.\n\n---\n\nDoohyun woke to pain and a system message burning across his vision.\n\n> [You have died.]  \n> [Experience penalty applied: -2.3%]  \n> [Resurrection in 5... 4... 3...]\n\nHe spawned at Reidan's outer checkpoint. Immediately tried to move. His character wouldn't respond.\n\n*What the hell?*\n\nThe farmer stood over him. How was he already here? The checkpoint was half a mile from where Doohyun died.\n\n\"Follow me.\"\n\nIt wasn't a request.\n\nDoohyun sent a whisper, fingers flying across the mental keyboard.\n\n*Grid, I finally made it to Reidan. But some insane farmer caught me and now I'm basically a slave. Help me...*\n\n> [The other person is in a place where they can't receive whispers.]\n\nHe tried again.\n\n*Ruby, help me...*\n\n> [The other person isn't connected to the game.]\n\nThe farmer grabbed his arm. The system registered it as a forced movement trigger. Doohyun's character began walking against his will, pulled along like a puppet.\n\n\"No—\"\n\n\"You will help with the harvest.\"\n\n> [Hidden Quest Generated: ★Fun and Exciting Training!★]  \n> [Difficulty: ???]  \n> [You cannot refuse this quest.]  \n> [You cannot log out until quest conditions are met.]\n\n*No. No, no, no...*\n\nThe professional cattle man was born in Reidan that day. His unique class abilities proved excellent for agriculture. The city's farming output grew. Nyangmong grew stronger, though nowhere near strong enough for Overgeared's standards.\n\nHe just worked the fields. Day after day. Waiting for someone to notice he was missing.\n\n---\n\n> [You have entered the 11th island.]\n\nGrid dismissed the notification and checked his gear. The lightning rod strategy had worked on the tenth island. Simple. Effective. Anyone with half a brain could've figured it out.\n\n*I'm not special.*\n\nThe thought was familiar now, worn smooth by repetition. But it didn't sting the way it used to. If other blacksmiths could think of the same solutions, fine. At least he was thinking now, instead of stumbling forward blind.\n\n*Yes. Slow growth is still growth.*\n\nSomething had shifted in his head over the past months. The fog that used to cloud his thoughts had thinned. Not gone, never fully gone, but manageable. He could see problems and trace the shape of solutions.\n\n*My head feels clearer.*\n\nTwo years as Pagma's Descendant. Two years of crafting, fighting, failing, learning. The gains weren't dramatic. No sudden explosion of genius. Just steady, grinding improvement. The kind that came from experience and brutal self-honesty.\n\nA new question surfaced, riding that clearer thought process.\n\n*What's on the last island?*\n\nHe'd come here to find Sage Sticks. The guides said Sticks appeared somewhere between the twenty-fifth and twenty-ninth islands. Not the end. So what was the final challenge? Why did the system call them \"challengers\" and award \"Challenger Points\"?\n\n*I'll ask Sticks when I find him.*\n\nNo point wasting mental energy on mysteries he couldn't solve alone. Sticks would have answers. About the East Continent. About the sixty-sixth island. About whatever the hell this place really was.\n\nA notification materialized.\n\n> [A mission will be created.]  \n>   \n> **[11th Island]**  \n> Defeat the Lizardwoman!  \n>   \n> First Clear Reward: 36 Challenger Points.  \n>   \n> [The mission will start in 30 minutes.]\n\nLizardwoman. Level 300 field boss. Served by tribes of lizardmen warriors. Known for dropping pink leather, the kind of rare material that made Faker's eyes light up whenever Grid mentioned it.\n\nGrid felt nothing.\n\nThe archipelago bosses didn't drop loot. Just experience. He'd learned that lesson on the first few islands. Disappointing, but he hadn't come here for items anyway.\n\nHe activated Fly and rose into the air.\n\nThe lizardman village spread below him. Two hundred and seven huts clustered around three large ponds. Grid counted the structures, estimated population density, mapped patrol routes.\n\n*Three ponds. That's the key.*\n\nThirty minutes. Not much time, but enough.\n\nHe landed near his portable furnace and pulled out iron ingots. The God Hands emerged, golden and gleaming, ready to work.\n\n**Clang. Clang. Clang.**\n\nHe hammered the iron into thin sheets, spreading it across a frame twenty meters in diameter. The God Hands worked the edges while he focused on the center. Ordinary blacksmiths would need hours for this. Grid had it done in eighteen minutes.\n\nThree massive iron plates. Each one large enough to cover a pond.\n\nHe stored them in his inventory and flew back to the village. The timer hit zero as he landed.\n\n> [The mission has started!]\n\nThe huts exploded with movement. Lizardmen poured out like ants from a kicked nest. Green scales. Yellow eyes. Crude weapons. Grid counted quickly.\n\nClose to a thousand.\n\n\"Noe! Randy!\" He pulled the iron plates from inventory and dropped them with earth-shaking crashes. \"Help the God Hands cover the ponds with these! I'll keep them off you!\"\n\nRandy nodded, his copied form already moving.\n\n\"Nyahaha! Master, believe in me!\" Noe's wings flared. \"Nyang!\"\n\n**Boom.**\n\nPagma's Swordsmanship, Transcend.\n\nThe sword dance erupted from Grid's blade in a wave of cutting force. It caught the first wave of lizardmen mid-charge. Shields rose. Some blocked. Others didn't. Bodies separated at the waist. Blood sprayed across the dirt.\n\n*Kieek!*\n\n*Kyaack!*\n\nThe screams were sharp, reptilian. More kept coming. Grid didn't stop moving. +9 Failure in his right hand. Sword Ghost in his left. He carved through them, but the numbers barely thinned.\n\nA lizardman broke through, spear aimed at his throat.\n\n**Clang.**\n\nThe God Hands had finished. All three ponds were sealed beneath iron plates. The sound of metal meeting stone echoed across the village.\n\n*Kik?*\n\nThe lizardmen faltered. Confusion rippled through their ranks. The ponds amplified their strength, granted stat bonuses tied to their connection with water. Grid had noticed it while scouting. Now those ponds were gone, buried under twenty meters of solid iron.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship.\"\n\nGrid switched to the +8 Grid's Greatsword. Heavier. Better suited for what came next.\n\n\"Transcended Link!\"\n\nTwenty strikes. Each one carrying 150% of his attack power. The greatsword became a blur. Lizardmen level 230, warriors hardened by years of tribal warfare, fell like wheat before a scythe. Their shields meant nothing. The water bonus was gone. They were just targets now.\n\n*Kyaack!*\n\n*Kieeeek!*\n\nGrid handed the greatsword to a God Hand and drew Iyarugt. The red blade hummed with hunger. He moved with Noe and Randy, cutting down stragglers.\n\nA roar split the air.\n\nThe Lizardwoman emerged from the largest hut. Three meters tall. Scales like emerald plates. Eyes that burned with intelligence and rage. Level 300. Strong, but Grid had fought Hell Gao. He'd killed Elfin Stone.\n\nThis was nothing.\n\nThe eleventh island fell.\n\nGrid continued upward through the archipelago. Twelfth island. Fifteenth. Eighteenth. Each one different, each one a new puzzle to solve.\n\nThen the twentieth.\n\n> [You have entered the 20th island.]\n\nGrid looked up.\n\nThe sky was wrong. Where a sun should have been, a massive circle floated. Composed entirely of eyes. Thousands of them, maybe tens of thousands, all watching. Blinking. Focused on him with an intensity that made his skin crawl.\n\nHis throat went dry.\n\n*What the hell is that?*\n\nThe eyes didn't move. They just watched. Waiting.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms**  \nOG: Glossary Link  \n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\n*Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
