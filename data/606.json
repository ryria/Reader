Make absolutely certain he's restrained, and find out if someone sent him.\" He paused, meeting the assassin's eyes. \"Under no circumstances are you to kill him. Understood?\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nAs Faker melted back into the shadows, Grid's jaw clenched. Wariness coiled tight in his chest—inevitable, given that he'd lost half his health from a single blow. *And I was wearing Triple Layers when that bastard hit me.*\n\nHis mind raced through possibilities. *Does he have some proportional damage calculation tied to my health or defense stats? Some type of armor-penetrating skill?*\n\nThe attack's overwhelming power gnawed at him. It was one thing to design his build around offense, accepting the trade-off in survivability. But this was the first time since Piaro that an NPC had demonstrated such devastating attack capability. What Grid had initially dismissed as a random madman turned out to be a significant Named NPC.\n\n*Between the Empire, the Yatan Church, hostile kingdoms, and god knows who else...* Grid's fingers drummed against his throne's armrest. *I have too many enemies to narrow down who sent an assassin.*\n\nThe higher he climbed, the more dangerous the fall became. What truly unsettled him was the brazen timing—an assassination attempt during the founding ceremony, surrounded by the full strength of Overgeared.\n\n*I need to increase security around Irene and Lord. Immediately.*\n\nPushing his concerns aside for the moment, Grid turned his attention to Baron Guy. While the other representatives had departed in various states of indignation and dismissal, the nobleman from the Fold Kingdom remained, his posture radiating desperate hope.\n\n*Just one kingdom...* Grid's shoulders sagged slightly.\n\nDespite his demonstration of magic battle gear and the kingdom's obvious military potential, only one representative had stayed. Before disappointment could fully settle in, Lauel's whisper tickled his ear.\n\n—*Isn't securing one vassal kingdom on the first day actually remarkable? Don't forget—we only founded the Overgeared Kingdom hours ago. Honestly, I expected every single representative to refuse and storm out.*\n\nGrid's frown deepened. *Still...*\n\n—*Look at the strategic value,* Lauel continued, his mental voice carrying that familiar edge of calculated enthusiasm. *Yes, the Fold Kingdom is impoverished. Their land is desolate, their coastline yields minimal resources. But they maintain three hundred thousand trained soldiers in constant conflict with monster territories. Supply them with food and proper equipment, and they'll transform into a formidable ally.*\n\n—*You just said their land is desolate and resource-poor. We can't sustain food shipments indefinitely. Isn't this a kingdom with no future? Won't our investment of time and resources end up completely wasted?*\n\n—*Not at all. First, they'll serve as a distraction—dispersing the attention of the other fourteen kingdoms while we consolidate power. Second...* Lauel's mental tone turned smug. *Don't we have Piaro?*\n\nGrid blinked. *Ah.*\n\nOf course. Piaro had transformed Reidan's barren desert into productive farmland. He'd made Siren's waterlogged soil viable for agriculture. Turning the Fold Kingdom's desolate territory into fertile ground would hardly challenge the legendary farmer's abilities.\n\n*Now that I think about it...*\n\nA thrill of possibility shot through Grid as he reassessed Piaro's astronomical value to the kingdom. His thoughts immediately jumped to the Golden Walnut and white phosphorus wood—species native to the East Continent. *Could a Legendary Farmer cultivate them on the West Continent?*\n\nThe implications made his pulse quicken. Golden Walnuts functioned as elixirs, granting permanent stat increases. White phosphorus wood represented the finest production material he'd ever encountered. Even small-scale cultivation would dramatically accelerate the Overgeared Kingdom's national power.\n\n*Perfect.*\n\nThe founding ceremony had been disrupted by Reidorn's sudden intrusion. Grid couldn't afford to let anxiety spread among the gathered crowd. With deliberate casualness, he adjusted his cloak to conceal his wound and palmed a health potion, drinking it in a motion that appeared like nothing more than taking a sip of wine. \n\nHe remained unaware that these small gestures—maintaining composure despite injury, projecting strength when wounded—impressed more than one observer in the great hall.\n\nGrid straightened in his throne and addressed Baron Guy with clear authority. \"Return to your king and deliver this message: The Overgeared Kingdom will provide comprehensive support to the Fold Kingdom. You witnessed the farmer who appeared earlier, yes?\"\n\n\"You're saying—\" Baron Guy's breath caught, his weathered face transforming with desperate hope. \"You'll help us with food supplies as well as battle gear?\"\n\n\"Naturally. Furthermore, I will fertilize the impoverished lands of the Fold Kingdom.\" Grid leaned forward slightly. \"You saw the farmer before, correct?\"\n\n\"Ohh...! Ohhh!\" Tears gathered at the corners of Baron Guy's eyes as he dropped to one knee. \"Your Majesty's generosity surpasses all expectations! I'll return to my king at once and report everything—King Grid's magnificence, and the... no, I'll tell him about the Marquis Farmer's capabilities!\"\n\n\"Go, then. May your journey be swift.\"\n\nBaron Guy rose, bowed deeply, and hurried from the hall. His face shone with barely contained excitement, already dreaming of liberation from the Saharan Empire's crushing dominance.\n\nViewers watching the ceremony's broadcast from beginning to end struggled to process what they'd witnessed.\n\n—*Is this actually happening? Gaining a vassal kingdom on the literal first day?*\n\n—*Will it become the Overgeared Empire at this rate?? ;;*\n\n—*It's definitely possible.*\n\n—*What empire? I'm from the Fold Kingdom and there's no future here. What's the point of serving a poor kingdom like Overgeared?*\n\n—*Exactly. To be honest, the Overgeared Kingdom looks shaky as hell. Did you see what happened? They have a thousand knights, but couldn't stop one assassin from reaching Grid. The Overgeared Kingdom isn't as powerful as the propaganda suggests.*\n\n—*Hrmm... I kind of want to try assassinating Grid now. Think of the fame boost.*\n\n—*Grid's probably going to get assassination attempts constantly after today's incident showed the security gaps.*\n\nThe viewers remained ignorant of Reidorn's true capabilities—a threat neutralized so quickly they'd missed the danger entirely. Instead, doubt crept into the community's perception of Overgeared's strength.\n\nA herald's voice rang out across the great hall: \"His Holiness Pope Damian and the Fifteen Elders of the Rebecca Church have arrived to honor the founding of the Overgeared Kingdom!\"\n\n—*...!!*\n\nThe announcement struck like a thunderclap. Powerful figures whose mere presence commanded reverence entered the hall, and the sight left even jaded viewers stunned. Everyone knew Damian worshipped Grid—that was common knowledge. But the Fifteen Elders? They were legendary for their strict impartiality and refusal to show favoritism.\n\nThe thought of them attending the Overgeared Kingdom's founding ceremony seemed impossible.\n\n—*The Elders don't even visit the Emperor of the Saharan Empire.*\n\n—*Right. Normally, kings have to travel directly to the Vatican just to meet them.*\n\n—*Why would the Elders appear at Overgeared's founding ceremony...?*\n\n—*And all fifteen of them...*\n\n—*Damian must have ordered them to come as Pope.*\n\n—*Ah, that makes sense. That's probably it.*\n\n—*Damian's seriously abusing his papal authority for Grid ㅋㅋ*\n\n—*He's going to get impeached at this rate.*\n\nThe viewers' speculation sounded reasonable—logical, even. Accurate based on standard political dynamics.\n\nBut 'reasonable' had never applied to Grid's story.\n\n\"It is an honor to meet you, Brother Grid,\" the lead Elder said, bowing with genuine respect.\n\n\"I have no doubt that Brother Grid, who always strives for peace in the world, will establish a kingdom founded on justice and prosperity,\" another added.\n\n\"We, the Fifteen Elders of the Rebecca Church, desire that the friendship between our faith and the Overgeared Kingdom will endure for all generations,\" the eldest declared.\n\nThe chat feeds went silent.\n\n\"Sword Saint Kraugel has arrived to honor the founding of the Overgeared Kingdom.\"\n\nKraugel strode forward, his presence commanding immediate attention. \"Congratulations, Grid. I believe you will accumulate countless victories in the years ahead.\"\n\n—*Even Hao and Alexander showed up...*\n\n—*I'm exhausted from being surprised.*\n\nFour years after Satisfy's launch, the first player-established kingdom announced its existence to the world in spectacular fashion. The reputation of Overgeared King Grid spread across every continent.\n\n---\n\n## ***\n\n\"Can I ask about the Overgeared Kingdom's future direction?\"\n\nBunny Bunny had once reigned as the world's premier gaming streamer. Then Grid's unintentional lies had turned him into a laughingstock—the shepherd's boy who cried wolf—and his popularity had plummeted ever since. \n\nNow, though, he'd secured an exclusive interview with Overgeared King Grid himself.\n\nThis was Grid's way of repaying the debt. His conscience still pricked at him for nearly ruining someone's career.\n\n\"The Overgeared Kingdom will develop based on consensus among the player base,\" Grid began, settling into his explanation. \"We'll rapidly identify what players want and focus our resources on meeting those needs.\"\n\n\"I see... A kingdom ruled by a player will naturally have advantages for other players.\"\n\n\"Precisely. I hope many players will consider immigrating to the Overgeared Kingdom. For new immigrants, we're offering fifty percent tax reduction for the first month—\"\n\nBunny Bunny's smile strained slightly as realization dawned. *This isn't an interview for my benefit. This is free advertising for his kingdom.*\n\nHe wanted to protest, but the viewer count climbing steadily in the corner of his vision kept his mouth shut.\n\nGrid launched into full promotional mode.\n\n\"Additionally, the Overgeared Kingdom aims to grow our military strength in partnership with players. I'll regularly organize monster subjugation operations where players fight alongside Overgeared soldiers. Within a month, I'll be conducting entrance tests to recruit new Overgeared Guild members. Interested players should contact Lauel for—\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Oh, Bunny Bunny, why don't you join our guild as well?\" Grid's expression brightened as if the idea had just occurred to him. \"Then you could deliver Overgeared's activities directly to your audience. Exclusive insider coverage.\"\n\n\"...Can I register right now?\"\n\n\"Once the promot—\" Grid caught himself. \"Once the interview concludes.\"\n\n\"Yep, take your time promoting your... I mean, please continue with the interview. Hehe.\" Bunny Bunny's professional smile never wavered, even as he died a little inside.\n\n---\n\n## ***\n\n> **[An intruder has appeared in the 'Beware Dogs' dungeon.]**\n\n\"What?\"\n\nDark's head snapped up from his work, eyes widening in disbelief.\n\nThe Dravian Mountains served as Blood Carnival's headquarters for good reason. This desolate range had once been the light dragon Nevartan's nest, and the lingering traces of draconic presence kept both monsters and players away. Humans rarely ventured here—the residual dragon fear affected even high-level creatures, and players avoided the area since it offered no worthwhile hunting grounds.\n\nYet someone had infiltrated? Not just the mountains, but the Beware Dogs dungeon specifically—hidden deep within Blood Carnival's territory. Finding it by accident seemed impossible.\n\n*A high-ranking explorer?*\n\nDark's mind jumped to precedents. The 1st ranked explorer Skunk had made headlines by discovering the Yatan Church's main temple location. But something didn't add up.\n\n*Why would anyone bother finding this specific place?*\n\nBeware Dogs existed to protect something particular to Dark's plans. There was no legendary treasure, no unique boss monster that would attract explorers. The dungeon offered nothing that would justify the effort of locating it.\n\n*Well, whatever.*\n\nBeware Dogs carried a Unique rating. Any intruder would inevitably fall victim to either the trap systems or the coordinated monster forces.\n\n*I deliberately left Zone 1 empty of monsters and traps—let intruders drop their guard. But Zone 2...* A grim smile crossed Dark's face. *Zone 2 is absolute hell.*\n\nHe felt confident the intruder would collapse long before reaching the dungeon's deeper sections. Dark returned his focus to dungeon construction, losing himself in the creative process.\n\nAn indeterminate time later, a system message shattered his concentration.\n\n> **[Zone 1 of the Beware Dogs dungeon has been completely destroyed!]**\n> **[The intruder has fled!]**\n\n\"*What?*\"\n\nConfusion giving way to alarm, Dark abandoned his work station and rushed toward Zone 1. When he arrived, his mind went blank.\n\nThe devastation was total. Absolute.\n\n\"This... what the hell happened here?\"\n\nZone 1 had been an empty space—deliberately so, part of the psychological trap design. There was literally nothing in Zone 1 worth destroying, no resources to loot, no obstacles to clear.\n\nYet everything was obliterated. The floor had been shattered into rubble. Walls reduced to crumbling fragments. Even the ceiling showed massive structural damage, with chunks of stone collapsed inward.\n\nDark couldn't comprehend the intruder's motivation.\n\n*Why destroy an empty room? What's the point?*\n\nIf the destruction had served some tactical purpose, he could accept it as his failure to anticipate the strategy. But this? This made no sense.\n\n\"What could they possibly have gained from this?\"\n\nLong after the unidentified intruder departed from Beware Dogs dungeon, Dark's anguished roar echoed through the dark cavern, unanswered.\n\n---\n\n## ***\n\n\"A dog profit.\"\n\nMinerals Detector Minor hummed cheerfully as he examined his haul. He didn't quite understand why Grid always placed an animal name before the word 'profit,' but he'd adopted the phrase anyway. It sounded cool.\n\n\"A dungeon full of valuable minerals but completely monster-free? Too easy!\" He shifted the weight of ore samples in his pack. \"This was the best discovery yet.\"\n\n*Lalalala~*\n\nMinor practically skipped down the mountain path, imagination running wild with possibilities. He felt certain Grid would recognize his achievement and reward him handsomely for bringing back samples of a new mineral type.\n\n*I'll become a Duke someday. Maybe even a King.* \n\nMinor's ambitions soared. He was aiming to become the second Grid—a legendary success story.\n\nHe remained blissfully unaware that his admiration for Grid had already transformed into something deeper. Hero worship, perhaps. Or the beginning of genuine loyalty.\n\nThe young Minerals Detector whistled as he headed home, completely oblivious to the chaos he'd left in his wake."
