  "content": "**Are you satisfied with being an orc?**\n\nThe survey results from players who'd undergone racial transformation painted a rosy picture—a 68% response rate with 80% positive feedback. The enthusiasm made sense. Most converts had been melee damage dealers drawn by the raw physical might of orcish physiology: inexhaustible stamina, robust health pools, devastating attack power, and panoramic vision. For warriors seeking pure combat prowess, the orc race delivered.\n\nForum discussions reflected this satisfaction:\n\n*\"It's the ultimate combat race. You survive longer, spot threats earlier. Against same-level players? You just don't lose.\"*\n\n*\"The downside is mana reduction. Half capacity means severely limited skill usage.\"*\n\n*\"Exactly. Low mana pool, glacial recovery rate—extended fights become brutal. Intelligence buffs aren't optional; they're mandatory.\"*\n\n*\"They really need to adjust the intelligence coefficient. Mages completely counter us. Can't resist status effects, magic tears through our health like paper.\"*\n\n*\"You're asking for too much. Though honestly, if we got an intelligence buff on top of everything else? Everyone would abandon humanity. The orc master race, lol.\"*\n\n*\"Right? We're already stronger than humans in most ways. Any more buffs and the game breaks.\"*\n\nThe conversations attracted thousands of curious onlookers across various communities. Despite clear drawbacks—protruding tusks, wandering eyes, jutting jaws that defied conventional beauty standards—the orc's raw combat advantages proved enticing. The aesthetic penalty was severe, admittedly. Worse still, orc NPCs' generally low intelligence meant quest content became a minefield of absurdly difficult tasks designed for creatures who didn't think like humans. \"Orcs have no quests\" had become a running joke.\n\nYet despite these obstacles, countless players raised their hands.\n\n*I'm switching.*\n\n*Same here.*\n\nAnyone whose class didn't depend heavily on complex skill rotations seriously considered the transformation. The Chinese media, meanwhile, launched what could only be described as a propaganda campaign.\n\n**\"Chinese martial arts remain one of our greatest cultural exports. Most Chinese citizens take pride in this heritage, naturally gravitating toward the martial artist class in Satisfy. Imagine thousands of martial artists amplifying their strengths through orcish physiology. The implications? Undeniable. Chinese players will dominate PvP competitions and reclaim the top rankings globally.\"**\n\n**\"Chinese players possess purity of purpose. While Grid relies on items and Kraugel on skills, Hao achieved greatness through pure control and self-discipline. This focus on internal development over external factors has, admittedly, left Chinese players somewhat isolated in the current meta. But the orc race changes everything. It addresses our weaknesses directly. China's future in Satisfy has never looked brighter.\"**\n\n**\"If our top rankers successfully transition to orcs, China will place second in this year's National Competition—minimum. Within two years, we'll surpass both the United States and South Korea.\"**\n\nThe fanatical praise reeked of orchestration. Government ambition lurked behind every glowing article, each one designed to herd players toward racial transformation and, by extension, national glory. The media blitz bordered on brainwashing. They even dragged Hao into their narrative, arranging an interview to legitimize their agenda.\n\n**\"Hao, the orc race has become a global phenomenon. Given that half-draconians receive no special stat bonuses, speculation suggests you'd become an unstoppable force as an orc. Your thoughts?\"**\n\n**\"It's true that half-draconian stats mirror human baselines. The developers likely reserved coefficient adjustments for when the race becomes widely available, similar to the orc situation.\"**\n\n**\"Unfortunate. So you're considering the change?\"**\n\n**\"No. Each account only permits two race changes, with a minimum two-year lock after transformation. Additionally, I benefit significantly from half-draconian skills. I won't sacrifice those advantages to become an ugly orc.\"**\n\n**\"I—I see.\"**\n\nThe Chinese media had alternately vilified and exploited Hao for years. Now they'd hoped to leverage his reputation to endorse their orc campaign. Hao remained China's top ranker regardless of past controversies. His endorsement would've been invaluable.\n\nInstead, he threw cold water on their plans.\n\n**\"Don't become blind about orcs. Yes, health and stamina coefficients are 1.8 times human baseline. But as the game progresses, skills will outweigh raw stats. That intelligence penalty will cripple you. And don't forget—the orc power structure breeds instability. Their might-makes-right philosophy guarantees future upheaval.\"**\n\n**\"Ah, yes. Let's end the interview there.\"**\n\nThe media turned on him immediately. Conspiracy theories flourished overnight: Grid must have ordered Hao to oppose China's ascension. In a nation where public opinion could be manufactured at will, destroying one man's credibility required minimal effort. Hao's warnings drowned beneath manufactured outrage.\n\n\"...Exhausting. Every single time.\" Hao's fatigue ran deeper than physical tiredness. \n\nMemories surfaced—South Korea, several years past. Streets lined with businesses bearing Grid's name and those of his guild members. That atmosphere of freedom...\n\nHe cut the thought short. His ancestors' faces materialized in his mind, generations of honor weighing on his shoulders. The path forward remained clear, if difficult. To escape the mental shackles that suffocated him, to earn genuine respect rather than mandated deference, he had to honor his country first. And the surest way to honor China?\n\nDefeat Grid.\n\n*Just once.*\n\nOne victory. One moment where he stood over Grid as the superior player. The Chinese narrative that painted Grid as villain and Hao as lapdog would crumble.\n\n*I must win.*\n\nFor his own liberation. For Grid's honor—yes, for Grid's honor, because the current narrative disrespected them both. Hao craved that victory like air.\n\n***\n\n\"ORC WARRIORS! WORSHIP TERUCHAN! GURUK! GRURUK! YOU RECEIVE GLORY—MARCH WITH ME TO WAR! WE TAKE HUMAN TERRITORY! GURUK! KRURUK! BUILD OUR EMPIRE!\"\n\n\"This is insane!\"\n\nThe transformed orc players trembled. They'd envisioned ranker glory, National Competition fame. Not *this.* Not conscription into some maniac's war of conquest.\n\nThe orc kingdom meant nothing to them. They'd spent mere months in these green skins—nowhere near enough time to develop patriotic fervor. Besides, what incentive existed? The new lord, who'd seized power through brutal combat, possessed all the diplomatic grace of a brick to the face. He bellowed about honor while offering zero tangible rewards. The players rejected his madness wholesale.\n\n\"I'm logging out of this war!\"\n\nThey tried to leave. Players were *players*, after all, meant to enjoy the game with freedom of choice. They owed this idiotic orc lord nothing.\n\nThen reality hit.\n\n[Abandoning your post designates you as a **Deserter**. Severe punishments and restrictions will be applied.]\n\n\"What the hell?!\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me?!\"\n\nOrcs worshipped power. Every orc qualified as a soldier by default—players included. The orc lord's unilateral military code granted no exemptions. Naturally, the players rebelled.\n\nThey logged out. They ran. They died.\n\nSurrounding orcs cut them down without hesitation. Behind, beside, ahead—the executions came swift. Death, resurrection, logout, login—the cycle changed nothing. The orc army had begun its march, and the system recognized them as military personnel under Teruchan's absolute authority.\n\nIn orcish society, the lord's will was law. Subordinate orcs couldn't defy their superiors. This hierarchy explained why twilight orc players received \"command rights over lesser orcs\" as a racial perk.\n\n[The Great Lord Teruchan has declared war!]\n\n[You will join his army by Teruchan's decree!]\n\n\"WHAT KIND OF BULLSHIT GAME IS THIS?!\"\n\nSatisfy's greatest selling point had always been freedom. Unless you committed crimes or accepted specific quest chains, you controlled your experience. That fundamental principle just shattered. Orc players who'd chosen the wrong moment for transformation found themselves trapped in a military nightmare.\n\n*Someone kill this bastard!*\n\nThe twilight orcs launched their conquest. Humans and orc players alike prayed for Teruchan's defeat. But stopping the fanatic and his elite warriors—beings evaluated as equivalent to great demons—proved nearly impossible. Everyone suffered.\n\n***\n\n\"Why is this developing differently than projected?\"\n\nIn Reinhardt's smithy, Grid clicked his tongue after absorbing Lauel's report. Both men wore troubled expressions. Their analysis had suggested minimal orcish expansion.\n\n\"The twilight orc lord rules all orcs absolutely,\" Lauel explained. \"I estimated he'd possess significant intelligence. In fact, the previous lord showed remarkable caution, maintaining a humane facade for centuries to avoid provoking the Empire while nursing grudges from past oppression. My analysis wasn't wrong.\"\n\n\"Yet you didn't anticipate *this.* You never mentioned another orc could murder the old lord and immediately start a war.\"\n\n\"It seemed obvious enough not to mention. I *did* anticipate it. Orcs determine leadership through strength. The throne changes hands whenever a stronger challenger emerges. I calculated that possibility.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nLauel's mental fragility remained his greatest weakness. Unexpected variables occasionally crashed his cognitive processes. Though to be fair, he successfully predicted 99 out of 100 complications.\n\n\"So you have a contingency plan within expected parameters?\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n*This lunatic.*\n\nLauel shrugged at Grid's anxious expression. \"The orc's march justifies Imperial intervention. The Empire granted them autonomy to maintain unity, but they can't ignore open warfare. The Empire will crush the orcs.\"\n\n\"Ah...\" Understanding dawned. The orcs had chosen the wrong master. They'd marched toward their graves.\n\n\"I see. Not our problem, then. Nothing we need to worry about.\"\n\nGrid nodded, relieved.\n\n\"NEWS! THE ORC ARMY HAS INVADED THE FOLD KINGDOM! ORC LORD TERUCHAN IS LEADING THE MAIN FORCE!\"\n\nGrid's expression froze. He rose, remembering Prince Shining's loyalty, the Fold Kingdom's unwavering support. \"I'm going. This ends now.\"\n\nLightning crackled across the Blue Dragon's Boots. Four black hands materialized in the air—the resurrected God Hands, ready for war."
