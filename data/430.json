  "content": "# Chapter 430\n\nDebirion, the indigenous god of hunting. He was the deity the monks served, and the source of Zibal's power. The class *Debirion's Envoy* specialized in one thing: hunting. Perfect for grinding levels. Perfect for climbing the rankings.\n\nThe fatal flaw? It was garbage in PvP.\n\nZibal had never cared. His combat instincts were sharp enough to compensate. He'd lost so few fights he could count them on one hand.\n\n*But those were against humans.*\n\nNow he understood. Against the true elite, the so-called \"sky above the sky,\" his talent was lacking.\n\n*During the Reidan invasion...*\n\nYes. A *hand plow.* That crazy farmer had killed him with a *farming tool.* The absurdity of it still burned. Then came the assassin Tarma. Then Pon's spear. Then Kraugel's blade.\n\nAnd now...\n\n\"Pinnacle Kill.\"\n\nThe greatsword descended.\n\n*Puhk!*\n\n> [You have been hit by a lethal blow!]\n> \n> [You have died.]\n> \n> [This is a server dedicated to the National Competition. The death penalty won't occur.]\n\nAnother death. Another defeat. The 2nd ranked user, master of the Snake Guild, reduced to a punching bag. Shame and fury clawed at Zibal's throat as the world faded to monochrome.\n\n*I was praised... I was always praised!*\n\nHe'd built his pride on being better than everyone. How could it end like this? How could he fall so many times in a row?\n\n*This can't continue.*\n\nHe had to reclaim his honor. Zibal clenched his fists as the death screen loomed.\n\n*I'll become stronger. I'll stop chasing rankings. I'll obtain strength that transcends the concept of level itself!*\n\nHe was a talented fool. On that day, he laid the foundation for true effort.\n\n***\n\n> [Your party member Zibal has died.]\n\nGrey particles scattered where the 2nd ranked user had stood moments before. The world reeled in shock.\n\nLauel did too.\n\n*What?*\n\nHe'd valued Zibal highly. Bold tactics. Unique boss raid capabilities. Rapid leveling. Natural combat instincts. Zibal had everything needed to sit in Satisfy's top ten. He was strong. He was *balanced.*\n\nYet Grid had killed him in one blow. Zibal had been under half health, true, but given his equipment and level, this was absurd.\n\nLauel's gaze locked onto the flail in Grid's hands.\n\n*That farming tool...*\n\nIt had triggered some monstrous buff. Grid's damage had at least doubled.\n\n*Crazy bastard. When did he make something like that?*\n\nGrid had spent time in the Behen Archipelago. Failing to track his current specifications was proving lethal. Anxiety crawled up Lauel's spine. He stepped back, forcing himself to view the entire battlefield.\n\n*Puhk!*\n\n*Kwajak!*\n\n\"...This is bad.\"\n\nBlood. Screams. Bodies. Lauel's eye twitched. The absurdity of it made him laugh despite himself. Grid was running wild like an unbridled foal, tearing through the US formation like wet paper.\n\n*The third advancement NPCs are being cut down like straw.*\n\nGrid's current state matched Super Sensitivity Kraugel. Disaster incarnate. A force beyond human resistance.\n\nBut Lauel didn't surrender. Buffs had time limits. The stronger the effect, the shorter the duration. Grid could maintain this for two minutes. Maybe three.\n\nHe started issuing orders.\n\n\"Set the forest on fire!\"\n\nThe NPCs obeyed instantly. Flames devoured the trees. Lauel cast Wind Dragon's Breath, accelerating the inferno. A sea of fire bloomed across the battlefield.\n\n\"Restrain the enemy!\"\n\nMagicians summoned barriers. Stone. Ice. Walls appeared, boxing Grid into a confined space.\n\nThe barriers lasted five seconds.\n\n*Kwa kwa kwa kwang!*\n\n\"T-This is impossible...\"\n\nThe magicians stared in horror. Barriers built with massive mana investments shattered under Grid's fists like wet cardboard.\n\nLauel grimaced. He had no choice.\n\n\"Zephyr! Tie up Grid's feet. I'm taking the Korean base.\"\n\nThe 1st ranked acrobat had been keeping Peak Sword and Yura busy. Now Lauel pulled him off that duty. Zephyr had failed against Kraugel due to low mana, but Zibal had vouched for his footwork.\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n*Pahat!*\n\nZephyr sprinted toward Grid without hesitation. No fear showed on his face. He trusted his skills completely.\n\n*He might be a monster, but he can't handle my acrobatics.*\n\nBuying time would be easy.\n\n\"Kyakyakyakyak!\"\n\nZephyr's laugh was shrill as he vaulted over Grid's head, spinning like a top. The movement activated *Acrobat's Laugh*, a skill that induced temporary hearing loss and confusion.\n\nGrid resisted.\n\nZephyr didn't flinch. He'd expected that. Grid's status resistance was well-documented.\n\n\"Kikikikikik!\"\n\nThe laughter served dual purposes. It kept enemies at bay while boosting his morale.\n\nGrid frowned. \"Why are you repeating it?\"\n\nThe confusion hadn't landed, but the sound was grating. Grid swung Iyarugt toward the approaching acrobat.\n\n*Pahat!*\n\nRed light scattered like jewels.\n\n*Peeeeeong!*\n\n\"Kuk!\"\n\nAn explosion rocked the area. Grid grunted, having struck not Zephyr but a clone rigged to explode. Through the smoke, Zephyr's eyes curved into crescent moons.\n\n\"Beast's Ring.\"\n\n*Peeng!*\n\nA blazing ring of fire materialized around Grid.\n\n*What?*\n\nAn enormous cerberus erupted from the flames, lunging toward Grid with terrifying momentum. Grid raised his guard reflexively.\n\nThe beast passed through him like smoke.\n\n*What the hell?*\n\nA trick? A pointless illusion? Grid dismissed it immediately.\n\nThen the ring ignited.\n\n*It's exploding!*\n\nGrid retreated. Zephyr capitalized, hurling twelve balls he'd been juggling.\n\n*Pepepepeok!*\n\n\"Kyakyakyak! Does it hurt?\"\n\nZephyr closed the distance, confidence oozing from every pore. He couldn't kill Grid, maybe, but playing with him for an hour? Easy.\n\nHe was too arrogant.\n\n\"It doesn't hurt.\"\n\n*Step.*\n\nGrid emerged from the smoke. His expression was calm. \"You'll die in five seconds.\"\n\nGrid had fought thousands of battles. He might not be clever, but he read opponents fast. He understood their patterns, their weaknesses, how to counter them.\n\nThat's how he could make such a declaration.\n\n\"Kyakyakyakyak! I don't know what you're talking about!\"\n\nZephyr laughed like it was the funniest joke he'd heard. Hundreds of doves materialized and swarmed Grid. Wings. Beaks. Feathers and excrement raining down, obscuring vision.\n\nGrid didn't falter. He activated every buff and charged straight at Zephyr.\n\n*He's resistant. Annoying.* Zephyr clicked his tongue. He removed his hat, preparing contingencies. When Grid attacked, he'd pull out a turtle for defense, then a rabbit for speed, then counter.\n\nGrid was too fast.\n\nHe stabbed the instant he arrived. No time for turtles. No time for rabbits. Zephyr's fingers scrambled.\n\n*Clown's Tears!*\n\nHis ultimate skill. Hallucinogenic effects. Seventy percent evasion boost. Combined with items, titles, and class effects, his total evasion hit ninety-one percent. Even targeted skills would struggle to land. He was functionally invincible.\n\nAnd yet...\n\n*Puk!*\n\n\"Cough!\"\n\nIyarugt pierced his heart. Pain flooded Zephyr's chest.\n\n*Why couldn't I dodge that?*\n\nHe'd evaded. The sword had *curved back* like it was magnetized to his flesh. The phenomenon defied logic. Zephyr coughed blood. Grid struck again.\n\n*Puok!*\n\n\"Kuheok...!\"\n\n*Why? Why can't I dodge?* A hypothesis formed through the agony. *Don't tell me his accuracy exceeds my evasion rate?*\n\nImpossible. No such fraudulent stat existed.\n\n*It's just luck...!*\n\nZephyr died clinging to denial.\n\n\"...\"\n\nSilence blanketed the battlefield. The 1st ranked acrobat, dismissed like a common mob. But the quiet didn't last.\n\n\"What are you doing? Sweep them all away!\"\n\nGrid's roar galvanized the Korean forces. Representatives and NPCs surged forward.\n\n\"Shoot! Shoot!\"\n\nUS archers and magicians retaliated, prioritizing Grid. Arrows and spells converged on him. But his defense had doubled. Even third advancement attacks couldn't pierce him fatally. The Holy Light set absorbed magic damage. His equipment was absurd. Elfin Stone's Ring kept his health topped off despite the bombardment.\n\nThen Lauel appeared before him, smiling brightly.\n\n\"I'm proud of you.\"\n\nGrid recognized the tone. People mocked him for relying on items, but Lauel understood. Using gear effectively required skill. A pig wearing pearls was still a pig. Grid had evolved beyond that. He wielded items with strategy, with *intelligence.*\n\n\"If you had no talent, you wouldn't have reached this point.\" Lauel's voice trembled. \"Maybe your stupidity let you keep trying when others quit. I sincerely respect you.\"\n\nGrid's eye twitched. *Is that a compliment or an insult?*\n\nRegardless.\n\n\"Can't you tell the difference between business and personal matters?\" Grid scowled. \"Stop being so delighted.\"\n\nHe was South Korea's representative. He fought alongside his team, not alone. He couldn't throw the match for Lauel's sake. Lauel nodded, expression sobering.\n\n\"I can.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nSomething was off. The confidence in Lauel's voice, the phrasing...\n\n*It can't be!*\n\nThe worst outcome materialized the instant Grid sensed it.\n\n> [Your castle was occupied by the enemy!]\n\nDefeat. South Korea had lost the siege. Lauel's smile widened.\n\n\"Setting fire to the forest was a signal to Skull.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe siege mode disabled party chat and whispers. The organizers wanted realistic, dramatic warfare. Grid had been careless. He'd focused on the battle in front of him while the real threat circled behind.\n\nGrid felt hollow.\n\n***\n\nSouth Korea lost the first siege match. But the world didn't condemn them. Didn't mock them. Players of every nationality praised the Korean representatives, especially Grid.\n\n\"Well fought!\"\n\nThe cheers were louder than when he'd won gold. Grid had delivered something transcendent. A performance that elevated him beyond jealousy.\n\nHe was becoming someone's object of *admiration.*"
