  "content": "# Chapter: Evolution of the Adversary\n\n---\n\n*...Danger.*\n\nThe instant Valhalla of Infinite Affection shattered, the clone experienced something entirely foreign—a dark, creeping sensation that coiled through his consciousness. Insecurity. Fear. For the first time since his creation, he understood what it meant to be mortal.\n\n*Armor destroyed. Irreparable.*\n\n[You have suffered catastrophic damage!]\n\n[Activating birth protection sequence. For the next five seconds, health remains fixed at minimum threshold. Death is temporarily impossible.]\n\nGrid's blade punched through his guard again. The clone's mouth opened, and a sound escaped that he'd never made before.\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nPain. Not damage calculations or status effects, but genuine, mind-searing *agony* that made his entire existence shudder.\n\n*Destruction?*\n\nNo. He refused to accept it. He wouldn't simply cease to exist—not when he was so close to becoming whole.\n\n\"Blackening!\" The word tore from his throat, blood spraying past his lips. He had to survive. Had to eliminate Grid and claim what should have been his from the beginning. \n\nDark energy erupted around him. His skin bleached to bone-white as his hair lengthened, black strands whipping in an otherworldly wind.\n\n[Physical capabilities have increased dramatically.]\n\n[Fusion skill 'Linked Revolve' unlocked.]\n\n[Fusion skill 'Transcended Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle' unlocked.]\n\n[Pagma's Swordsmanship: Splendor unlocked.]\n\nThe clone had copied Grid's physical parameters upon entering the Behen Archipelago. During his time in hell, he'd hunted relentlessly, grinding past level 400. His stats had undergone the fourth awakening—impressive by any standard, though still inferior to Grid's equipment-enhanced specifications.\n\nBut his *swordsmanship*? That was different entirely.\n\nUnlike Grid, who'd diversified into the Hero King's power and the Undefeated King's techniques, the clone had lived and breathed nothing but Pagma's Swordsmanship. Every waking moment dedicated to a single discipline. His proficiency had evolved beyond Grid's, granting access to fusion skills and sword dances that required not just knowledge, but physical transcendence only achievable through Blackening.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship.\"\n\nThe clone's eyes blazed with dark comprehension. Grid needed higher stats to unlock these techniques. Raw power mattered more than Grid had realized. Leveling wasn't just progression—it was *evolution*.\n\n\"Transcended Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle.\"\n\n\"...?!\" \n\nGrid felt it instantly—the fundamental shift in his opponent's threat level. The clone moved with fluid grace impossible moments before, his enhanced body finally capable of executing the five-fusion sword dance at full capacity.\n\nDozens of energy blades materialized in rapid succession, each one crackling with condensed power.\n\n\"Transcended Link!\" Grid launched his own technique to intercept—then faltered.\n\n*Impossible.*\n\nThe energy blades didn't converge. Instead, they scattered like a flock of predatory birds, each one tracking an independent trajectory.\n\n\"...?!\" \n\nThe attacks vanished from his field of vision entirely.\n\n\"Master!\" Noe's desperate cry cut through the battlefield chaos.\n\nThe Blade Aiming at the Gods suddenly jerked skyward, no longer responding to Grid's will.\n\n*What—?!*\n\nInstinct screamed at Grid to look up. His head snapped back.\n\nThe sky was *full*.\n\nDozens of energy blades hung suspended overhead, their arrangement so perfectly geometrical it resembled an aurora of death itself.\n\n\"Revolve!\"\n\nPure reflex. Grid's body moved before conscious thought could catch up, driven by primal survival instinct. The five-fusion technique packed far more power than he'd anticipated—those weren't just attacks, they were the Pinnacle variation of the sword dance, each blade capable of devastating damage.\n\nThey fell like judgment from heaven.\n\n\"Lephel's Embrace!\" \n\nEuphemina's voice rang out as she burned through a saved skill. Divine protection flared to life—a desperate plea to the indigenous god served by monks, begging him to shield Grid from the descending catastrophe.\n\n\"Arrow Rail!\"\n\nJishuka launched dozens of arrows in a spreading pattern above Grid's head. The defensive technique transformed her projectiles into a barrier—fragile hope against overwhelming force.\n\n\"Your Majesty!\"\n\n\"Grid!\"\n\nLauel wove wind magic through the air, attempting to deflect the sword energy's trajectory. Peak Sword charged forward, his own blade raised to intercept.\n\nFutile. All of it.\n\nThe attack power of Transcended Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle simply *exceeded* the combined defensive capabilities of the ten meritorious retainers. The energy blades fell like a biblical deluge, seemingly contemptuous of the efforts to stop them.\n\nGrid's Revolve technique created a vortex around him, the rotating sword energy devouring some of the incoming attacks. But only *some*. A single counterattack couldn't possibly neutralize dozens of projectiles falling simultaneously.\n\n\"Kugh!\" \n\nGrid collapsed to his knees, blood erupting from multiple wounds. Several energy blades that entered his Revolve's effective radius were absorbed and reflected back at the clone.\n\n\"Ohhh!\" The spectators roared in approval. They understood—Grid was gambling on mutual destruction.\n\nBut the clone was no fool.\n\n\"Revolve.\"\n\nThe reflected attacks reversed course *again*, creating a deadly loop aimed solely at Grid. The crowd's enthusiasm died. This wouldn't be mutual destruction—this would be Grid's death alone.\n\n\"Revolve!\"\n\nAnother voice joined the chorus of counterattacks. A second Grid appeared—*Randy*, Grid's doppelganger. The clone's reflected attacks were caught and sent back once more, threatening the original aggressor.\n\nThe clone had once summoned his own Randy copy, but—\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship.\"\n\nThe clone's Randy had perished during his descent into hell. Now he stood alone against two opponents.\n\n\"Linked Revolve.\"\n\nThe chain continued. Counterattack feeding into counterattack, each revolution amplifying the energy blades' destructive potential. The enhanced projectiles screamed toward Grid with exponentially increased power.\n\n[You have lost more than 70% of maximum health.]\n\n[First King title effect activated.]\n\n[Protective shield generated from health lost in the last minute. Shield duration: Terrain adaptability increases by 100%, movement speed and defense increase by 10%.]\n\n\"Keuk...!\"\n\nGrid teetered on the knife's edge between survival and oblivion.\n\n[You have suffered catastrophic damage!]\n\n[A legend doesn't die easily. Activating immortality state: Resist all damage for 5 seconds with minimum health maintained.]\n\nBut legends didn't fall so easily. Five seconds—it was *everything*. Grid entered his immortality window just as the clone's protection sequence expired.\n\n\"Blackening!\" \n\nHope surged through Grid's veins. He poured every ounce of power into his transformation.\n\n\"Linked Kill Wave.\"\n\nThe clone unleashed his assault.\n\n\"Freely Move!\"\n\nGrid activated the skill that allowed him to phase through all non-targeted attacks. The distance between them collapsed in an instant.\n\n\"Drop!\"\n\nThe technique triggered—instantaneous, unavoidable. Victory crystallized in Grid's mind for a single, beautiful moment.\n\nThen the God Hands intervened.\n\n\"...?!\"\n\nDrop's activation sequence *failed*. All four God Hands shot forward, latching onto Grid's arms with mechanical precision. They spread his limbs wide, crucifying him in midair. His body refused to respond.\n\nThe clone's mastery over the God Hands far exceeded Grid's own.\n\n\"You...!\" Grid struggled against the implacable grip, but it was useless. He hung suspended, completely helpless.\n\n\"I am you.\"\n\nThe clone's voice slithered into Grid's ears like poison. In that moment, Grid understood with crystalline clarity—the clone didn't just want to kill him. It wanted to *replace* him. To consume his existence entirely and wear his identity like a second skin.\n\nThe horror of that realization struck deeper than any blade.\n\n\"You...\" Grid's voice dropped to a lethal whisper. His eyes burned with killing intent. \"You *must* die.\"\n\nOnly the clone's complete eradication could guarantee his safety. There was no other option. No compromise. No mercy.\n\nAn obvious smile spread across the clone's face—the expression of someone who'd finally grasped a fundamental truth.\n\n\"You are the one who will die.\"\n\nEven now, the clone was evolving. Through the crucible of fear and the ecstasy of narrowly escaping death, he was experiencing the full spectrum of emotions. For the first time, he was genuinely *dreaming*.\n\n\"I am Grid.\"\n\n\"...!\"\n\nFailure—no, the *Enlightenment Sword*—pierced through Grid's heart.\n\n*Tang! Tang!*\n\nThe clone produced a hammer and struck the embedded blade with methodical precision, each blow transforming the weapon further. Failure became what it was always meant to be.\n\n\"Four seconds.\" \n\nThe clone pressed the Enlightenment Sword deeper, feeling it grind against Grid's ribs.\n\n\"Three seconds.\"\n\nThe countdown to Grid's death. The clone understood the mechanics perfectly—once the immortality window expired, Grid would die. All he needed to do was maintain pressure until the timer ran out.\n\nOf course, variables always existed.\n\n\"Get your hands off him *now*!\" \n\nAsmophel's roar was joined by the ten meritorious retainers. All of them launched simultaneous attacks, attempting to blast the clone away from Grid.\n\nBut the clone had kept one final trump card in reserve.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship: Splendor.\"\n\n*Flash!*\n\nBrilliant white light exploded from the sword impaling Grid's heart. The sudden radiance struck the retainers and Asmophel like a physical blow, inducing temporary blindness.\n\n\"One second.\"\n\nThe end. The clone savored his imminent victory, already envisioning the future he would inherit. The God Hands tightened their grip, ensuring Grid couldn't move even a millimeter.\n\n\"Result: Your death.\"\n\nThe clone activated Kill.\n\n\"...?!\"\n\nAnother flash erupted—but this one came from an unexpected source. The sound of steel punching through flesh and bone echoed across the battlefield.\n\nLight elemental and Blade Aiming at the Gods—linked attacks launched in perfect synchronization.\n\n\"Kugh!\" \n\nBlood sprayed from the *clone's* mouth. Not Grid's. Despite every prediction, every calculation, the clone was the one falling.\n\n\"Do you also have the Rune of Darkness?\" \n\nGrid wrenched himself free from the God Hands' grip, their control disrupted by their master's collapse.\n\n\"...\" \n\nThe clone didn't answer. He simply knelt, blood pouring from his lips.\n\nGrid pressed the question. \"If I'd used the rune's power, would you have copied it like you did with the armor and sword?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Clever bastard.\"\n\nGrid would be lying if he claimed to feel nothing for the clone. There was discomfort when he considered the loneliness and confusion the creature must have endured—born with the singular purpose of killing him, struggling to understand its own existence.\n\nBut sympathy changed nothing. The clone threatened Grid, threatened his kingdom, threatened everyone he'd sworn to protect. Compassion was a luxury he couldn't afford.\n\nThe clone had to die.\n\nGrid's blade flashed toward the exposed throat. Without his armor, the clone was critically vulnerable. This was the end—Grid was certain of it.\n\nAt least, until the Guardian's Necklace and Guardian's Bracelet on the clone's wrists suddenly pulsed with light.\n\nThe Indomitable effect activated."
