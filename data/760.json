  "content": "# Chapter: The Power of Preparation\n\n**Monster Obstacle Race.** Thirteen gates, each guarded by a different boss monster. The objective: break through all of them and reach the finish line. Where the saint sword drawing event tested strength and intelligence, this race demanded raw stamina and relentless power—a marathon of consecutive raid encounters with no respite.\n\nStamina separated the wheat from the chaff. Between the brutal terrain and endless combat, only those with exceptional endurance and resource management could survive. Every nation sent their absolute best. Fifteen champions stepped onto the course.\n\nThe Korean roster raised eyebrows—only Jishuka from Overgeared Guild? Analysts predicted a bloodbath regardless. No one predicted *this*.\n\n\"Fly Up!\"\n\n*Kiiiiiiing!*\n\nThe Red Phoenix Bow sang. Jishuka perched atop the third boss—a massive pinky dragon—and the moment every other participant entered her field of vision, the race was already over.\n\n*Peng! Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!*\n\n\"What the—?\"\n\n\"SCAM! THIS IS FUCKING INSANE—*UWAAAACK!*\"\n\nOne attack. *One.* The phoenix flames washed over the scattered contestants like the judgment of an angry god. Players crumpled, health bars evaporating. The pinky dragon's breath finished the survivors, reducing them to grey ash.\n\nIn the Korean waiting room, the other Overgeared members exchanged knowing looks.\n\n\"Riding the dragon without burning... yeah, that's broken.\"\n\n\"Good thing we sat this one out.\"\n\nThey'd learned long ago: never compete in the same event as Jishuka when she wielded the Red Phoenix Bow.\n\n『 J-Jishuka wins! Brazil claims gold! 』\n\nWhile other players limped through each checkpoint, wounds accumulating with every boss, Jishuka breezed through gate thirteen looking fresh as morning dew. Hundreds of cameras caught her radiant smile from every conceivable angle. Hearts around the world skipped beats.\n\nShe blew a kiss toward the Korean section. \"Grid, save your strength for the finals! Chu~!\"\n\n\"BOO! BOOOOO!\"\n\n\"DIE ALREADY, GRID!\"\n\nThe crowd's roar shook Tokyo Dome. Grid sat in the waiting room, enjoying his chocolate pudding with a satisfied smile.\n\n\"Must be nice, being encouraged by beautiful women.\"\n\nHe turned to Yura. \"Hm?\"\n\nShe glared daggers at him. \"Is that pudding extra sweet today?\"\n\nGrid blinked, utterly baffled by her hostility.\n\n---\n\nThe final day of the National Competition arrived too quickly. Four of nine events had already concluded. The world's annual festival was winding down.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\nToon returned to the waiting room clutching two bronze medals, his head bowed. Grid stood immediately.\n\n\"What are you apologizing for? You fought brilliantly. Thank you for those precious medals.\"\n\n\"Toon, you were incredible!\" Peak Sword added. \"The entire nation will be celebrating!\"\n\n\"But...\"\n\nToon's gaze remained locked on the massive display board dominating the center of Tokyo Dome.\n\n**Overall Rankings:**\n\n1. **United States** — Gold (5), Silver (7), Bronze (3)\n2. **Canada** — Gold (5), Silver (5), Bronze (4)\n3. **China** — Gold (4), Silver (2), Bronze (1)\n4. **United Kingdom** — Gold (3), Silver (2), Bronze (4)\n5. **South Korea** — Gold (3), Silver (1), Bronze (2)\n6. **Brazil** — Gold (1), Silver (0), Bronze (1)\n7. **Mongolia** — Gold (1), Silver (0), Bronze (0)\n8. **Japan** — Gold (0), Silver (2), Bronze (3)\n9. **Italy** — Gold (0), Silver (2), Bronze (3)\n10. **France** — Gold (0), Silver (1), Bronze (4)\n\nBronze medals meant little in the grand scheme. A single silver outweighed dozens of bronze. That truth burned in Toon's chest—South Korea's ranking hadn't budged despite his efforts.\n\n\"I wanted South Korea to be first,\" Toon whispered. \"I wanted to make you happy. Your family...\" His voice cracked. \"But I'm useless.\"\n\nToon was an orphan. No parents, no family, no home. The mafia had raised him on Italy's streets, a criminal nobody loved. Until Grid.\n\nGrid's family welcomed him to South Korea with open arms. They believed in him, cared for him—not because of who he was, but because he was their son's friend. They treated him like family. Like he *belonged.*\n\nEvery meal around their table, every casual conversation, every moment of warmth—Toon had cried himself to sleep more times than he could count, overwhelmed by a happiness he'd discovered far too late in life.\n\nHe'd wanted to repay them. Desperately.\n\n\"Yura's incredible,\" Toon continued, unable to meet anyone's eyes. \"But against Jishuka with the Red Phoenix Bow? I don't see how she wins gold. And Peak Sword...\" He hesitated. \"Even if Grid defeats Kraugel in PvP and takes gold, we still won't reach first place overall. It's... it's my fault.\"\n\n\"Hey, why am I being written off?!\" Peak Sword protested.\n\nToon didn't hear him. Shame clouded his vision until Grid's hand settled on his shoulder, warm and steady.\n\n\"Lift your head.\" Grid's voice was gentle but firm. \"You're my bodyguard, aren't you? How can you protect me staring at the ground?\" He smiled. \"Don't worry about Yura and Peak Sword. They'll both bring home gold.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nEvery head in the waiting room swiveled toward Grid. The math didn't work. Everyone knew it was impossible for South Korea to claim first place. Yet Grid spoke with such absolute conviction that for a moment, doubt flickered.\n\nGrid's grin widened. \"Give me a minute. I need to log in.\"\n\nHe gestured toward the capsule in the corner, then beckoned Yura and Peak Sword closer.\n\n\"Should we try for first place? How long are we going to settle for second?\" His eyes gleamed. \"Don't you think it's about time we won something?\"\n\nYura and Peak Sword exchanged glances, bewildered.\n\n---\n\nAcross the venue, Viola nudged Eat Spicy Jokbal. \"The Overgeared King really cares about his teammates, doesn't he?\"\n\nShe'd watched Grid hand something to both Yura and Peak Sword in the capsule room.\n\n\"So? Does that make you happy?\" Her teasing smile widened.\n\n\"Shut up.\" Eat Spicy Jokbal's cheeks reddened, but his gaze never left Grid. Every movement fascinated him.\n\n---\n\n**Target Processing**—the event where Grid had first announced himself to the world years ago. This year, rule changes limited participation to one player per nation. Yura would represent South Korea.\n\nThe favorite? Jishuka, obviously.\n\nAnalysts predicted she'd summon the red phoenix immediately, carpet-bombing both targets and competitors until nothing remained. Theory suggested she was unbeatable.\n\n『 Yura was considered a strong contender in previous years... 』\n\n『 But against Jishuka now? There's no competition. 』\n\nEven Korean commentators sounded resigned.\n\n『 Mathematically, South Korea could still claim first overall... 』\n\n『 If the US and Canada fail to medal in the remaining five events, and Korea sweeps four golds in a row— 』\n\n『 Right. Theoretically possible. But let's be realistic. 』\n\n『 Jishuka's dominance is too absolute. Peak Sword's excellent, but frankly, he's not gold medal material. Though there's no shame in that! 』\n\n『 Exactly. Our players have exceeded all expectations. We should celebrate what they've accomplished. 』\n\nThe world had predicted Korea would place dead last this year. Instead, they were contending for the podium. No one would criticize them for falling short of first.\n\nThe target processing event began.\n\nJishuka moved immediately, racing through the forest toward the highest vantage point. Her strategy was perfect—use Fly Up! to create maximum line of sight, then obliterate every target and competitor simultaneously. Gold medal secured in one devastating attack.\n\n『 Jishuka's reached the hilltop! 』\n\n『 From that elevation, she can see everything—ground targets, aerial targets, and every competitor on the map. 』\n\nCameras focused on her as she drew the Red Phoenix Bow. The event that was usually fiercely competitive looked like a coronation.\n\n*Kkirik!*\n\nJishuka smiled. One hundred twenty targets in her field of vision. She activated Fly Up!\n\nThen—\n\n*Taaang!*\n\nThe crack of a rifle echoed from the forest below. Birds exploded from the treeline in a panicked cloud. Jishuka's vision flickered.\n\n> [You have been shot.]\n>\n> [You have died.]\n\n'What—?'\n\nHer avatar dissolved into grey particles before comprehension could catch up.\n\n*Clink.*\n\nIn the forest, Yura smoothly transitioned Alex's Magic Engineering Bayonet from sniper mode to rifle mode. The Demon Slayer exclusive item—the legendary weapon Grid had retrieved from Behen Archipelago—revealed itself to the world for the first time.\n\n**This was the power of items.**\n\n---\n\n\"OUR GODDESS DID IT!\"\n\n\"*WAAAHHHHHHHH!*\"\n\n\"**YURA! YURA! YURA!**\"\n\nSouth Korea erupted. Fifty million people celebrated as one, watching Yura's name flash at the top of the leaderboard. The overall rankings shifted upward. Maybe—*just maybe*—first place was within reach.\n\nSocial media exploded with congratulations, especially from those who remembered Yura's heartbreaking loss to Kraugel in the saint sword drawing event. The outpouring of support proved how deeply she'd captured the nation's heart.\n\n\"If Canada and the US don't medal in the last four events...\"\n\n\"And South Korea wins three more golds...\"\n\n\"The remaining players are Grid and Peak Sword, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah!\"\n\n\"...Never mind, it's impossible.\"\n\n\"Peak Sword can't win gold.\"\n\nThe excitement deflated. Peak Sword was undeniably top-tier—easily one of Korea's three strongest, a world-class player by any measure. But the world was full of monsters. Expectations remained tempered.\n\nThen Peak Sword emerged from the preparation room.\n\nHis expression was different. Solemn. Focused. Gone was his usual carefree demeanor. And at his waist hung a beautiful sheath of transparent crimson—bloodstone, shimmering with inner light.\n\n**Iyarugt's Sheath.** The legendary demon sword's perfect companion.\n\nThe crowd's murmuring quieted. Something had changed."
