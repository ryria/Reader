The left horn curves wickedly, a blade meant to inspire terror. Just seeing it triggers primal fear.*\n> \n> Conditions: Level 150+, Strength 400+\n> \n> Weight: 800\n\nMy pulse quickened. *Auction house listing. Now.* The gold would be insane.\n\nThen the bead.\n\n> [<span class=\"rarity-rare\">Red Lightning Summoning Bead</span>]\n> \n> *A frostlight orc shaman's power crystallized.*\n> \n> Summons red lightning from the sky. Temporarily increases weapon attack power and imbues electrical attribute.\n> \n> * One minute casting time\n> * Drains 10% health per use\n> \n> Weight: 50\n\nI rolled it between my fingers, feeling the static charge prickle my skin.\n\n\"Then there's the blessed stones...\"\n\n> [<span class=\"rarity-rare\">Blessed Weapon Enhancement Stones</span>]\n> \n> Magic stone for weapon enhancement.\n> \n> * Success: Enhancement value **+1**\n> * Failure: Enhancement value **-1**\n> \n> Weight: 20\n\n> [<span class=\"rarity-rare\">Blessed Armor Enhancement Stones</span>]\n> \n> Magic stone for armor enhancement.\n> \n> * Success: Enhancement value **+1**\n> * Failure: Enhancement value **-1**\n> \n> Weight: 20\n\nItems could be enhanced to +10 in Satisfy. The problem was cost. Enhancement stones ran expensive, and the higher the value, the worse the odds. Standard enhancement stones punished failure with a brutal -3 penalty, making high-tier gear as rare as finding diamonds in shit.\n\nBut blessed stones? Only -1 on failure.\n\nI stared at the pile of five blessed stones glittering on the workbench.\n\n*This is highway robbery. Regular enhancement drops you three levels on failure, but blessed only drops one? The risk is nothing.*\n\nFirst time I'd even seen blessed enhancement stones exist.\n\n*Wait.* My stomach sank. *High rankers probably swim in these things.*\n\nThat explained how top players strutted around with +6 and +7 gear like it was nothing. I'd always wondered. Now I knew.\n\nThe <span class=\"rarity-mythic\">Ideal Dagger</span> lay beside the stones.\n\n*Should I enhance it?*\n\nI only had nineteen sylphid scales. Not enough for the Hooded Zip-Up. Which meant no stealth, no avoiding the monsters in Kesan Canyon. I'd have to fight my way through like a common thug.\n\n*I'm level 85 now, but...*\n\nStat-wise, I matched users over level 100. But stats weren't everything. My combat skills? Pathetic. Four skills total. The frostlight orcs were pushovers compared to what waited in that canyon.\n\n*Can I even survive with only four skills?*\n\nI gripped the dagger's hilt.\n\n\"Right. Enhance the dagger. That's the play.\"\n\nPagma's Descendant increased enhancement success rates. No explanation for the percentage, but legendary class had to mean something substantial.\n\nI headed for the auction house, fingers flying through the interface.\n\n*General weapon and armor enhancement stones... 100 gold. Blessed versions... 1,200 gold each.*\n\nTwelve times the cost. And I'd just looted five blessed stones from one raid boss.\n\n*Five stones equals 6,000 gold. That's 720,000 won in real money.* I calculated the rest. *The unique helmet, the lightning bead, the sylphid scales... how much was that chieftain actually worth?*\n\nMost raids split loot evenly among party members. Pennies for everyone. But I'd soloed this with Huroi, and I'd pocketed everything.\n\nMy conscience, that withered little thing, twitched.\n\n*Should I give Huroi a cut?*\n\nThe raid only succeeded because he sacrificed himself. Burned through firebombs and potions. Lost experience on death. I'd be scum not to share.\n\n\"Kuk...\" The word scraped out of my throat. \"Scum. Yeah, that's accurate.\"\n\nBut wait.\n\n*He only got his second class because of me.* I straightened. *The debt he owes me is astronomical. Why should I pay him? He should be serving me.*\n\nI kept everything, just as planned. Purchased ten weapon enhancement stones. Returned to Khan's smithy.\n\nEarly morning light filtered through the forge windows. Khan stirred from his cot, eyes focusing on me.\n\n\"Grid! Thank the gods!\" He pushed himself upright. \"I was worried sick. You look well.\"\n\n\"Worried? The orcs weren't even a challenge.\" I dumped my loot across his workbench.\n\nKhan's eyes skipped past my smug expression, landing on the items.\n\n\"By the ancestors...\" He lifted the helmet, turning it over. \"Terrible craftsmanship from an aesthetic standpoint, but the defense is exceptional. Ogre skull base, I'd wager. And this bead?\" He rolled it between calloused fingers. \"Mysterious aura. I can't place the origin. And these... sylphid scales?\" His voice dropped to a reverent whisper. \"I've only heard tales. I wouldn't know where to begin.\" \n\nThen he spotted the leather.\n\nHis breath caught.\n\n\"This material.\" Khan's hands trembled as he spread the Frostlight Orc hide across the bench. \"Resilient. Perfect absorption ratio. As inner armor beneath plate, this would distribute impact like nothing I've worked with.\"\n\nIdeas were already forming behind his eyes.\n\nI pushed the leather toward him.\n\n\"Gift. But I want armor from this.\"\n\n\"I...\" Khan hesitated. \"What if I ruin it?\"\n\n\"If you don't want it, that's fine.\" I reached for the leather. \"Such a difficult, rare material. The frostlight orc leather. Who knows when I'll find another chance to work with something this precious...\"\n\n\"I never said no!\" Khan snatched the hide protectively. \"Leave this to me. I'll forge something worthy of its origin.\"\n\nPerfect.\n\nI set the <span class=\"rarity-mythic\">Ideal Dagger</span> and enhancement stones on the anvil.

Relatively high success rate meant most users could manage it. Prices barely differed between +0 and +5 items.\n\nBut +6?\n\nThat's where the real hell started. Success rates plummeted. Ordinary users rarely owned +6 equipment. From +6 onward, stats increased by 7% instead of 5%, and the item's appearance improved with a faint aura. Worth the risk.\n\nWorth the potential ruin.\n\n\"Please.\" I pressed the stone against the blade. \"Just succeed.\"\n\nI trusted Pagma's Descendant.

That familiar, soul-crushing frustration with my class.\n\n\"The description says increased probability!\" I grabbed the dagger, knuckles white. \"So why the hell can't I reach +6?!\"\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**\n**OG:** Glossary Link.\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
