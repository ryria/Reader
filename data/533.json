  "content": "The Red Phoenix Bow Grid envisioned matched the White Hammer smithy's design almost perfectly. White. Powerful flames. The connection crystallized in his mind—the main material had to be white phosphorus wood.\n\nWhite phosphorus wood possessed hardness comparable to dragon iron, yet remained surprisingly lightweight and generated its own potent flames. An ideal material for the Red Phoenix Bow. Yet no other blacksmith in Pangea had considered it.\n\nWhy? Not stupidity. Common sense.\n\nThe white phosphorus tree couldn't be felled by any ordinary blacksmith. No one in their right mind would even attempt to craft with such material. The wood's explosive volatility made the very idea absurd.\n\nBut Grid had done it. He alone in this world possessed the means to harvest white phosphorus wood.\n\n\"Isn't that white phosphorus wood?\" someone murmured.\n\n\"Impossible...\" another breathed.\n\nTens of thousands of eyes fixed on the stage surrounded by pine trees. The new White Hammer blacksmith had produced straight white timber—unmistakably resembling white phosphorus wood. Yet the crowd's disbelief held firm.\n\n\"White phosphorus trees can't be cut, can they?\"\n\n\"I heard they explode if you try.\"\n\n\"Must just look similar. Can't actually be white phosphorus wood.\"\n\nBut what other tree in this world matched the white phosphorus tree's distinctive appearance? Plenty of trees bore white bark, yet white phosphorus wood remained unique—perfectly straight, without a single twisted grain. As confusion rippled through the crowd, a hostile voice cut through.\n\n\"Damn White Hammer frauds! Can't win on skill, so they resort to cheap theatrics!\"\n\nThe shout came from the Blue Flames section across the stage. Enoch's voice rang with genuine fury. He despised seeing attention diverted from last year's champion to the White Hammer smithy.\n\n*Grabbing attention through performance, not skill,* Enoch seethed. *Pulling out fake white phosphorus wood? Nothing but an irritating, meaningless stunt. Pathetic.*\n\nDawhite. The man Enoch once respected above all others. Complicated emotions churned within him—watching the smithy Dawhite built lose all honor and crumble into disgrace.\n\n*Dawhite!*\n\n*Why did you choose White as your successor and destroy everything? All your achievements, rendered worthless. Even the greatest humans fall prey to bloodline obsession!*\n\n**Kwack!**\n\nEnoch placed his finest prepared firewood into the furnace. He channeled a secret technique, summoning blue flames within.\n\n\"I'll show you the world's most ideal flames!\"\n\n**Hwaruruk!**\n\nEnoch pumped the bellows. Blue flames surged upward. Scorching heat rolled across the stage, washing over the crowd.\n\n\"Ohh! Those flames!\"\n\n\"Indeed, that blue glow is magnificent!\"\n\nBlue flames of the highest quality in the Cho Kingdom. Even Dawhite had acknowledged them before his death. These flames could refine the lowest grade iron ore into the finest quality. Unmatched!\n\nThe blazing spectacle seized the crowd's attention. They turned away from the White Hammer smithy and the mysterious white wood.\n\nMeanwhile, Grid observed Enoch's flames with appreciation.\n\n*He's skilled with the bellows,* Grid mused. *Craftsman-level technique with flames.*\n\nJust a craftsman. Nothing compared to a legendary blacksmith.\n\nGrid's initial excitement dimmed. *I hoped to learn something from the Blue Flames smithy like I did from White Hammer. Disappointing.*\n\n*Though the White Hammer technique is genuinely special.*\n\nThis Dawhite they kept mentioning must have been an excellent blacksmith indeed. Grid filed the thought away and tossed the white phosphorus wood into the furnace.\n\n**PEEEEEONG!**\n\n\"...!\"\n\nAn explosive boom erupted from the White Hammer furnace. The startled crowd and blacksmiths whipped their attention back. Shock painted their faces.\n\n\"W-What? Those flames?\"\n\n\"They're swallowing the furnace?\"\n\nImmense flames roared from the blast furnace, leaping outside to engulf the entire structure. Red fire burst skyward like the surface of the sun. While others stood frozen in astonishment, Enoch burst out laughing.\n\n\"Puhahaha! Someone who can't handle the bellows! Such intense fire will never properly refine materials! It'll burn everything to ash... **Hak!**\"\n\nEnoch's laughter died.\n\n**Puok. Puok. Puok.**\n\nGrid.\n\nThe new White Hammer blacksmith pumped the bellows handle in rhythmic repetition.\n\n**Hwaruruk! Hwaruk!**\n\nThe raging flames—tamed in an instant. Enoch and the chiefs of Black Anvil and Red Tongs smithies stared, eyes wide with disbelief.\n\n*Flames I deemed impossible to control... subdued so quickly?*\n\n*The way he handles those bellows—absurd. His hands move like they've done this for a lifetime.*\n\n*Who is this man? Standing before heat intense enough to melt skin, and he doesn't even flinch? His skin hasn't even reddened?*\n\n**Kurururung!**\n\nA deep rumble resonated from the White Hammer furnace—the sound of temperatures climbing to unprecedented heights.\n\n\"I-Impressive. But isn't the temperature too high? Won't he be turned to ash before he can even introduce the iron?\"\n\nGrid explained to the nervous White, \"It might seem dangerous, but this is necessary. Cut white phosphorus wood is merely hard. It doesn't naturally produce flames.\"\n\nHowever, the fire attribute lay dormant within. White phosphorus wood required activation through extreme heat stimulation. Knowledge granted to him as a legendary blacksmith—the system's gift.\n\n**Hwaruruk!**\n\nThe furnace flames emitted temperatures so extreme that proximity became unbearable. White and the other White Hammer blacksmiths retreated one or two steps. Grid stepped forward. He placed the prepared white phosphorus wood into the furnace and accelerated his bellows work.\n\n**Puok! Puok! Puok!**\n\nRelentless airflow steadily drove the blast furnace's temperature higher.\n\n*Impossible!*\n\nThe Blue Flames smithy blacksmiths began denying reality. From their perspective, Grid seemed inhuman—a great demon wreathed in hellfire. Enoch, in particular, felt genuine fear creeping through him.\n\n\"Success.\"\n\nGrid halted the bellows and extracted the white phosphorus wood from the furnace. The wood gleamed far whiter than before, radiating beautiful luminescence. Grid gripped it with tongs, placed it on the anvil, then drew a hammer only Pagma's Descendant could wield.\n\n**PEEEEEONG!**\n\nThe moment Grid's hammer struck—\n\n\"**Ha!**\"\n\nThe chiefs of Black Anvil and Red Tongs smithies inhaled sharply. Grid's forging quality surpassed even his bellows mastery!\n\n*That young man...!*\n\n*Perfect!*\n\nHe exceeded Dawhite in his prime. Enough to invoke thoughts of the legendary blacksmith—known only through stories.\n\n**Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!**\n\nGrid continued forging. His hammer reshaped white phosphorus wood—hard as dragon iron—gradually bending it to his will. A notification appeared before the sweating blacksmith.\n\n> **[The Legendary Blacksmith's Patience skill has been activated.]**\n> **[Concentration, stamina and defense will rise to the extremes for one hour.]**\n\nNormally, such a buff would be welcome. But Grid had entered a state where nothing else mattered. Only the Red Phoenix Bow existed. He added the minotaur horn he frequently used when crafting Jishuka's bows. This provided elasticity, helping bend the wood into proper bow shape—matching exactly the Red Phoenix Bow design White had shown him.\n\n*This is the bow's most evolved form.*\n\nThe bow took shape beneath Grid's busy fingers.\n\n*Good. Really good.*\n\nGrid's satisfaction and confidence swelled.\n\n*Worst case scenario—*\n\nEven if the Red Phoenix Bow finished with an <span class=\"epic\">Epic</span> rating, he could use **Item Upgrade** to elevate it to <span class=\"unique\">Unique</span> rating and safely clear the quest. **Item Upgrade** had limited uses like his creation skill, but Grid judged this quest worth the investment.\n\n*I need to raise my affinity with White and Han Seokbong.*\n\nThe reason was simple. Han Seokbong would possess information about the other four guardian weapons in the same category as the Red Phoenix Bow. Grid planned to acquire every production method while on the East Continent. He estimated the Four Auspicious Beasts battle gear would rival divine items in value. Mass producing them would make his army invincible.\n\nMeanwhile, Enoch's body trembled in the distance.\n\n\"How? How does that newcomer possess such skills?\"\n\nThe black-haired man before him surpassed Dawhite. Enoch didn't want to acknowledge Grid's abilities—couldn't accept it. Yet as a blacksmith, he felt infinite respect for Grid's craftsmanship. An instinct impossible to resist.\n\nThen—\n\n> **[The Red Phoenix Bow has been completed!]**\n\nSeven hours, fifty-nine minutes, and forty-nine seconds since the competition began, Grid finally stopped. The pure white bow with its fluid curve captured everyone's attention with breathtaking beauty.\n\n\"Red Phoenix... Bow!\"\n\nThe lord rose to his feet. Han Seokbong, who had monitored Grid throughout the competition, felt the Red Phoenix's energy radiating from the bow Grid created."
