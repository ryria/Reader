  "content": "**Defeating the Hero should have been inevitable.** One year in reality—three years within Satisfy's accelerated flow—and the Hero NPC had remained static while every challenger grew stronger. Last year proved it; the Hero fell to multiple contenders, a stark reminder that even legends could not escape time's erosion.\n\nYet this year's Hero defied expectations.\n\nHe repelled famous powerhouses and brutally dismantled those foolish enough to challenge him unprepared. This was Grid's true nature laid bare—the Overgeared King rendered time itself meaningless. The realization sent tremors through the global audience: a monster named Grid was slowly consuming their world.\n\nOnly Kraugel remained steady against the Hero's onslaught.\n\nHis time meant nothing. His efforts, denied. His development, erased. Yet despair never touched his face. He had prepared for this long ago.\n\nTwo years as Sword Saint. Two years of losses, of rising again, of tempering himself into something far beyond last year's champion. He possessed knowledge and information accumulated across his journey to the peak of two billion users. The transformed Kraugel resembled a fictional character returned from the future—someone reliving life with perfect foreknowledge, starting from zero as humanity's sole hope against the Grid menace.\n\nKraugel neutralized the Hero's strike with *Shedding* and drove his sheath into the ground.\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThe Hero's sword dance aborted mid-step. The sheath blocked his footwork pattern, canceling the skill entirely.\n\nThe Hero adapted immediately, initiating a different sword dance.\n\nKraugel's sheath intercepted again.\n\nThe cycle repeated.\n\nKraugel knew every sword dance in Grid's arsenal since last year. But the Hero didn't panic. Once his footwork became predictable, he wove false steps into the sequence—correcting paths in real time, inserting movements unrelated to sword dances to confuse his opponent.\n\nThe Enlightenment Sword clashed endlessly against the White Tiger Sword. Black flames scorched Kraugel; stone thorns pierced the Hero. Amid this furious exchange, Kraugel drew another blade, then another—summoning two more swords from his inventory while planting sheaths to seal the Hero's movement. Blades and sheaths hammered the Hero from multiple angles.\n\n\"*Kuek*...\"\n\nAnger flared in the Hero's eyes—a crack in his composure, an opportunity.\n\nKraugel's prediction sharpened the instant the Hero lost control.\n\n\"*Splitting the Sky*.\"\n\nThe technique learned from Great Swordsman Piaro—the same strike that wounded Great Demon Belial—tore through the air after Kraugel evaded the Hero's attack.\n\n\"*Cough!*\"\n\nBlood sprayed from the Hero's mouth. Three of ten health bars vanished. The accumulated damage throughout the battle made even his legendary defense buckle under this technique's weight.\n\n\"...Am I seeing this right?\"\n\n\"Wait—blocking sword dances with a *sheath*? How did he even conceive that?\"\n\n\"It's not just the idea. His body *executes* it.\"\n\nMost viewers couldn't grasp the battle's intricacies, but some watched in awe. Chris, pursuing ultimate swordsmanship himself, felt the impact most keenly.\n\n*'His thinking operates on a different dimension.'*\n\nHe almost questioned heaven's design. Why create both Grid *and* Kraugel in the same era?\n\n\"If they'd been born in different times, neither would have reached this height.\" Lauel's voice cut through Chris's thoughts. \"They push beyond limits because they recognize each other as rivals. They've shattered their boundaries repeatedly through mutual awareness.\"\n\nChris blinked. \"So you're saying—\"\n\n\"Isn't it heaven's design to birth transcendent beings beyond humanity?\" Lauel's grin turned manic. \"Preparing us for some massive enemy. *Kuk, kukukuk*... Perhaps Earth's dimensional gates will open soon.\"\n\n\"Ah...? I see...\"\n\nChris suppressed a shudder. *Why is Lauel in another country's waiting room spouting conspiracy theories?*\n\n『 **Blackening...! The Hero reveals his true power!** 』\n\nOn screen, the Hero facing Kraugel turned pitch black. Dark hair rose as demonic energy coalesced around him—the prelude to *Transcend*. The Hero created distance and began firing sword energy, suppressing from range while activating Cray's Power for 100% life steal. Blood from his wounds formed crimson tails that menaced Kraugel. The pressure seemed lethal to approach. God Hands moved to eliminate airborne swords as Kraugel controlled his weapons while evading the bombardment.\n\n*'Shedding won't work.'*\n\nThe Sword Saint's passive deflected attacks without damage and could break enemy stances—but energy blades that exploded on contact rendered it useless.\n\n*Transcend* lasted roughly thirty seconds. Kraugel knew Grid intimately; he wouldn't waste this window. He planned to avoid the Hero, whose *Blackening* amplified both attack speed and power while *Transcend* enabled ranged devastation.\n\nKraugel activated *True Clouds*. Blue mist billowed from his sword, erasing his presence.\n\nWhite sparks ignited above the fog.\n\nThe Alarm spell. One of Grid's abilities when he had mental power to spare. The Hero had maintained *Alarm* + *Magic Missile* combos on cooldown since battle start—an attack optimized for striking defenseless opponents.\n\nLight rained down. Dozens of energy blades from *Transcend* surged forward while *Magic Missiles* bombarded from above.\n\n*'He synchronized the spell's activation with Transcend?'*\n\nTrapped between magic and energy blades, Kraugel triggered *Super Sensitivity* and retreated faster than *Transcend's* projectiles. His form blurred through the fog while his *Sword Curtain* deflected *Magic Missiles*—movements too swift and complex for most viewers to track.\n\nYet the Hero pushed *Insight* and the Slaughterer's Eye Patch to their limits, never losing his target. The fog from *True Clouds* that obscured vision and blocked detection barely hindered him. Continuous movement drained stamina rapidly.\n\nAfter confirming the *Magic Missile* barrage ended, Kraugel stopped to adjust his sword—forced by the *Reveal Sharp Teeth* effect from his +8 White Tiger Sword (now unique rating).\n\nThe Hero didn't miss the opening. Sensing his target's pause, he drew the Ideal Dagger. Enlightenment Sword in his right hand, Ideal Dagger in his left.\n\n\"*Quick Movements*.\"\n\nThe Hero's agility maximized. Deeming the dagger expendable, he hurled it through the air like a dart while firing six consecutive energy blades at the frozen Kraugel.\n\nKraugel twisted his back.\n\n*'Just... a bit... more.'*\n\nThe attack speed was blistering. Energy blades poured forth with virtually no interval. Kraugel waited for the perfect moment—a breathtaking gambit. He waited until over twelve energy blades closed in. Exactly twelve reached his nose before Kraugel swung his sword alongside six floating blades.\n\nThe timing nearly failed. One sword engaged with the God Hands was struck by the thrown Ideal Dagger and spun away. The freed God Hand smashed Kraugel's collarbone with Failure.\n\n\"*Kuek*...! *Tearing the Sky!*\"\n\nA storm of sword energy ripped skyward like beast claws. Four of eighteen energy blades struck Kraugel; the remaining fourteen reversed toward the Hero.\n\nThe Hero neither intercepted nor dodged. *Tearing the Sky's* counterattack trajectory was limited to above—the fourteen deflected blades sailed over the Hero's head and detonated.\n\n『 **Ah! He missed?** 』\n\n『 **Looks like he lost balance after that God Hand strike. The energy blade damage seems substantial...** 』\n\nThe commentators pitied Kraugel as he walked through the fog. But unlike their assessment, Kraugel had accomplished his intent. The cascading explosions overhead generated massive shockwaves that rattled the Hero's body.\n\nKraugel stood still and swung his sword.\n\nFifteen meters separated him from the Hero—a distance no blade could cross. Yet nobody thought Kraugel was striking air. They knew about the sword that severed the world itself.\n\nThe clean cutting sound from Kraugel's blade echoed across the distance.\n\nThe clouds above...\n\nThe earth between them...\n\nEverything comprising the landscape split cleanly, as if it had always been that way.\n\n*Space Sword*—one of Kraugel's ultimate techniques.\n\n\"...!?\"\n\nThe Hero's eyes widened.\n\n*This bastard was learning.*"
