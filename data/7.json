  "content": "# Chapter 7\n\nThe average level of black magician users was level 53. Out of the 120,000 classes in Satisfy, black magicians held the lowest average level. The class was combat-oriented, yet users suffered from weak defense and insufficient attack power.\n\nYura had been hunting alone since she started. Her control skills were unmatched, her magic usage precise. She selected hunting grounds with surgical efficiency. There was a reason she surpassed two billion users to reach fifth place in the rankings.\n\nThree hours ago, she'd finally hit level 230. A new spell unlocked.\n\n*Now I can use defensive magic.*\n\nYura opened her skill list to confirm the A-grade spell she'd acquired after grinding for weeks.\n\n*Diamond Barrier.*\n\nA shield formed from crystallized mana, hard as diamond. The defensive spell unlocked for black magicians at level 230.\n\nShe'd completed all the requirements. Now she needed the spellbook.\n\nYura headed straight to the Yatan Temple. As always, she chose one with fewer users. The distance was inconvenient, but preferable to the alternative. Her popularity made crowded temples unbearable. People recognized her even with her face concealed and her ID hidden.\n\nAfter two hours of travel, she arrived at the Yatan Temple. She placed the prepared spellbook on the altar and knelt.\n\nThe moment she began professing her faith in God Yatan, a notification flashed across her vision.\n\n> [A foolish group of enemies hostile to God Yatan has appeared inside the temple.]\n>\n> [Guardian of the Temple]\n>\n> **Difficulty:** S\n>\n> Blasphemers have entered to rescue the sacrifice to God Yatan. You must defend the dignity of God Yatan and punish the intruders.\n>\n> **Quest Clear Conditions:** Repel attackers or defend the sacrifice for one hour.\n>\n> **Clear Reward:** Title 'Guardian of Yatan's Temple'\n>\n> * **Guardian of Yatan's Temple:** Faith +300, Health +1,000, Intelligence +60. You are an example to believers after defending the dignity of God Yatan. God Yatan will bless you more, and the faithful will worship you.\n>\n> **Quest Failure:** Level -2, Faith -250\n\nYura's breath caught. An S-grade quest. She'd only experienced three of these, despite being level 230.\n\nDistant shouts echoed through the temple corridors.\n\n*An auto-generated quest triggered by intruders. Lucky timing.*\n\nHer pulse quickened. The 'Guardian of Yatan's Temple' title was valuable. It elevated all her important stats.\n\nShe identified the sacrifice's location first, then moved toward the disturbance. In the main hall, an NPC in leather armor was carving through Yatan followers. Blood sprayed across the stone floor.\n\n*Third class advancement.*\n\nAn S-grade quest earned its difficulty rating. The NPC called Doran was lethal.\n\n*Even with the believers' help, this will be difficult.*\n\nShe'd finally received an S-grade quest after months, but the odds looked grim.\n\n*No. Stop guessing. Start working.*\n\nYura exhaled slowly and dispersed her mana throughout the entire temple. This wasn't standard black magician technique. Detection required fine mana manipulation. For Yura, it was routine.\n\n*Two enemies total, including Doran.*\n\nShe focused on the user following Doran. His ID appeared above his head: Grid. His equipment looked cheap. Level 80, maybe. Surprisingly low for someone attempting an S-grade quest.\n\nDoran was the real threat. The user was negligible.\n\n*I can clear this.*\n\nYura studied the temple's terrain while her enemies fought the believers. She made her decision and descended to the basement where the sacrifice was held.\n\nThe temple's main hall was too spacious, too many pillars for cover. That gave Doran the advantage. The basement was cramped. Perfect for limiting his movement and increasing her magic accuracy.\n\nShe waited.\n\nAfter several minutes, Doran and Grid entered the basement. Doran was already battered from fighting through the believers.\n\n\"These ridiculous bastards! They need more people than that to be our opponents!\" Grid shouted. \"Now, Doran! Get rid of them!\"\n\nDoran nodded. Hidden weapons flew from his sleeves.\n\n\"3,600,000 won and the earl's daughter, here I come!\" Grid charged forward, confidence radiating from his stance.\n\nYura felt a flicker of sympathy. He had no idea what was about to happen.\n\n*Tatatang!*\n\nHer **Diamond Barrier** materialized, deflecting Doran's projectiles with sharp metallic rings. The weapons clattered across the stone floor.\n\nYura turned her gaze to Grid.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to take the sacrifice.\"\n\nDoran was strong. She needed to focus on him. That meant eliminating the weaker target first.\n\nFire gathered in her palm. She didn't hesitate.\n\n> [Critical Hit!]\n\nThe greatsword Grid carried marked him as a warrior class. A level 80 warrior, even with decent equipment, would have roughly 4,000 health. Grid's equipment looked subpar. Probably 3,000 health. And warriors were fragile against magic.\n\nYura had calculated the hit to consume one-fifth of her mana. A critical hit should have been fatal.\n\nGrid survived.\n\n*How?*\n\nEven with absurd luck, he should be stunned. Taking 40% damage in one hit triggered the stun status. Yet Grid stood there, unaffected, as if the damage barely registered.\n\n\"That was a critical hit...\" Yura's voice came out uncertain. \"Based on your equipment, you're only around level 80. How are you fine?\"\n\nShe was ranked fifth among two billion users, closing the gap with fourth place. Her gaming skills were elite. Her damage calculations were never wrong. Not once in all her time playing Satisfy.\n\nThis was new.\n\n*Why? Is his level higher than his equipment suggests? No. That doesn't make sense. Who wears low-level equipment to an S-grade quest? What did I miss?*\n\nShe tried to analyze calmly, but Grid was approaching.\n\n**Step. Step.**\n\nHe walked at a glacial pace, as if closing the distance to a black magician was trivial. His attitude dismissed her fifth-place ranking entirely. His body language screamed a challenge: *I'm giving you time to chant. Use your best spell.*\n\nObvious provocation.\n\nYura's pride flared. Fine. She'd give him exactly what he wanted.\n\nShe began chanting top-level attack magic. She'd reduce him and Doran to ash.\n\n\"Great god of the darkness, your humble servant calls you. Fill this place with darkness and plant fear in the enemies' hearts, show your power to those who worship you.\"\n\nMagic power surged. The torches lighting the basement began to flicker. No, they weren't going out. The flames turned **black**. Darkness swallowed the basement whole.\n\nAny normal enemy would lose their vision. The added fear effect would root them in place. Doran hesitated for a moment, pausing his assault on the black magicians behind Grid.\n\nGrid kept walking.\n\nHis resistance exceeded that of a third advancement NPC.\n\n*What is he?*\n\nThe ID was unknown. Not a ranker. Then how was he this strong?\n\nHer confusion deepened. But the spell reached completion.\n\n\"**Dark Storm!**\"\n\n**Kwa kwa kwa kwang!**\n\nA silent storm formed in the darkness and struck Grid. Pillars supporting the basement shook. Cracks spiderwebbed across the ground and walls. Power capable of collapsing the entire temple.\n\nTop-tier dark attack magic, fully realized.\n\n**Kwaang!**\n\nGrid's body, already damaged from the black magicians' earlier attacks, disappeared into the storm. Yura waited for the grey light of death.\n\nGrid kept walking. He penetrated through the storm without pause.\n\nBehind him, Doran's body was shredded, barely standing. A green light emerged from his ring, healing him enough to follow. A third advancement NPC couldn't handle her magic.\n\nYet this user was **fine**.\n\n\"You...\" Yura's voice came out small. \"What are you?\"\n\nShe'd always been smart. She could see through anything with logic. In her 21 years, everyone praised her beauty and intelligence. She used her innate insight in her work, earning a reputation as a talent who could succeed anywhere.\n\nSatisfy was the path she'd chosen.\n\nThis brilliant Yura couldn't figure out the man called Grid.\n\n*This shouldn't be possible in Satisfy. This overwhelming presence... is he human or NPC? A bugged user? No. Satisfy is controlled by the world's leading supercomputer, Morpheus. There are no bugs. There's a rational explanation for this strength. But how did he gain it?*\n\nFor the first time, she encountered something beyond her understanding. Baffled. Intensely curious.\n\nAt this moment, the person called Grid burned into Yura's mind.\n\nGrid approached with steady footsteps. Yura couldn't give up. She prepared to fight.\n\nThen Doran stepped on Grid's back, launched himself upward, and attacked.\n\n**Kaaang!**\n\nYura blocked Doran's strike with magic, then snapped her gaze back to Grid, expecting an assault.\n\nHer eyes widened.\n\nGrid's body, intact just moments ago, was dissolving into grey light.\n\n\"......?\"\n\nAfter that, Yura received severe injuries struggling with Doran. She barely subdued him. She stared at the spot where Grid disappeared, ignoring the system notification confirming her quest success.\n\n*Even hit by Dark Storm, he wouldn't have died so suddenly. He must've been penalized and forcibly logged out. But why?*\n\nHer expression darkened as she worked through it.\n\n*Did he... yield the quest to me?*\n\nHelplessness crashed over her. She'd received Grid's sympathy.\n\nThat day became the worst day of Yura's life. The day her pride was thoroughly shattered."
