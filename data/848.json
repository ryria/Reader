  "content": "# Chapter 848\n\nFor seven years and ten months, three titles dominated competitive gaming worldwide: *Underwatch*, *Rainbow Seven*, and *Unlimited Battleground*. The FPS genre reigned supreme, with *Unlimited Battleground* claiming the throne for three consecutive years after its release. Millions watched in awe as professional players demonstrated inhuman precision and reflexes, their split-second decisions elevating gaming to the realm of art.\n\nAt the apex of this golden age stood one name: Haster.\n\nThe man wasn't merely skilled—he was transcendent. Across all three major titles, analysts declared him the undisputed best. His control bordered on supernatural. He would wait motionless for minutes, reading enemies through audio cues alone, then strike with lethal efficiency. American media hailed him as their answer to legends like Lim X-hwan and FakX. Even international journalists couldn't dispute his dominance.\n\nThen Satisfy launched, and the old world crumbled overnight.\n\nVirtual reality didn't just compete with traditional gaming—it devoured it whole. Within months, the global audience abandoned everything else. Viewership collapsed. Sponsorships evaporated. The E-sports Association begged Haster to stay, to anchor their dying industry.\n\nHe retired anyway.\n\nAfter all, a new frontier awaited.\n\n***\n\n\"Two years.\" Haster's lips curved into a faint smile as puzzle pieces clicked into place. \"I've been searching for two years.\"\n\nRed Knights. Betrayal. Asmophel.\n\nThe fragments formed a complete picture.\n\nWhen Haster first entered Satisfy, reality had struck him immediately—his legendary reflexes meant nothing here. Stats limited movement speed. Equipment created power gaps no amount of skill could bridge. Classes imposed rigid frameworks on combat styles. Every advantage he'd cultivated in traditional games became irrelevant against these systemic barriers.\n\nSo he'd made a calculated decision: obtain a hidden class that matched his cognitive abilities. Not the strongest class—flexibility mattered more than raw power. He needed something that could adapt to any situation, that wouldn't constrain his tactical mind with arbitrary limitations.\n\nThen he'd discovered the Red Sage.\n\n\"You've been waiting?\" Suspicion colored Asmophel's tone as he studied the young man before him. Winfred's disciple stood relaxed, almost welcoming. It made no sense. Asmophel had betrayed that friendship, destroyed Winfred's life, condemned him to years of persecution. Why would this student greet him with anything but hatred?\n\n\"For revenge?\" The words tasted bitter. Once, Asmophel would have welcomed death. He'd have begged for it. But circumstances had changed—he served a king now, bore a sacred duty. His life belonged to that oath.\n\n\"Didn't Master earn the title 'Wise Red Sage' for a reason?\" Haster's question hung in the air between them.\n\nAsmophel went rigid.\n\n\"You think he didn't see the puppet masters pulling your strings?\"\n\nThe tremor started in Asmophel's hands, spread through his entire frame. \"He... knew?\" The revelation crashed over him like a wave. \"Winfred knew the truth...\"\n\nTears gathered at the corners of his eyes—relief and regret mixing into something unbearable.\n\nThen Haster moved.\n\nThe bow appeared in his hands with practiced ease. The arrow flew. Asmophel twisted sideways on pure instinct as the projectile hissed past. Before he could recover, Haster closed the distance, longsword already in motion.\n\n\"What—\" Asmophel barely parried the strike. His mind reeled. No mention of revenge. Acknowledgment of the truth. So why attack? \"Explain yourself!\"\n\n\"No revenge involved.\" Haster's voice remained eerily calm, contrasting sharply with the aggression of his movements. \"I'm testing something.\"\n\n\"Testing what?\" Flames erupted along Asmophel's blade as he countered.\n\n\"Whether it's time.\"\n\n\"Time for what?\"\n\n\"For the king to reclaim his throne.\"\n\nThe question burned in Haster's mind as he pressed his assault. Was the stage finally set? Could the name that once commanded millions of viewers return to prominence in this new arena called Satisfy? He needed to know his current limits, but the traditional benchmarks—Kraugel, Grid—presented complications. Defeating established legends this early risked cementing him at their level rather than above it. Losing would tarnish everything.\n\nBut this fight? This worked perfectly.\n\n**[Descendant of the Red Knights]**\n\n**Difficulty: Class Quest**  \n**Rating: SS**\n\n*You have inherited the techniques and knowledge of Red Sage Winfred, First Knight of the Red Knights. However, inheritance alone does not prove worthiness. The path demands validation.*\n\n**Quest Objective:** Defeat a former Red Knights member in single combat.\n\n*Winfred left clues to their whereabouts before his death.*\n\n**Reward:** Unlock all Red Sage class skills.\n\n\"King's throne? Your riddles waste my breath!\" Asmophel's flaming blade carved toward Haster's torso.\n\nThe attack never connected. Haster flowed through the defensive pattern Winfred had drilled into him—Ice Dance manifesting as a crystalline barrier that absorbed the heat. Steam exploded outward as fire met frost. Through the white cloud, a spear tip emerged, aimed precisely at Asmophel's abdomen.\n\nAsmophel twisted. The point scraped across his armor rather than punching through. Both combatants' eyes widened simultaneously.\n\n*'Magic, spear, and sword in seamless rotation? Winfred reborn...'*\n\n*'He read that combination? Even Kraugel struggles with that sequence.'*\n\nHaster released the spear, already transitioning. Asmophel's counterattack whispered through the air—literally whispered. Haster couldn't track the blade visually, but his ears painted the trajectory. He spun, abandoning his own strike to minimize the graze across his cheekbone.\n\nBlood welled. He retreated three steps.\n\nAsmophel's expression shifted. \"That footwork... it's not Winfred's technique.\"\n\n\"Because I developed it myself.\"\n\nSilence stretched between them. Not from fear—Asmophel recognized the danger this opponent presented, but victory remained possible. No, something else troubled him.\n\nThe cabin behind Haster sat utterly silent.\n\nInitially, Asmophel had assumed Winfred was simply hiding, observing the confrontation. But no presence emanated from that structure. No sound. No aura. Nothing.\n\n\"Is Winfred away from home?\" The question emerged carefully controlled despite the dread creeping up Asmophel's spine.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then where—\"\n\n\"He died. Last year.\" Haster's words fell like stones into still water. \"The Empire destroyed everyone he cared about. They hunted him across three territories. His mind and body gave out.\"\n\n\"Because of me.\" The confession came unbidden. \"I betrayed them all.\"\n\nGuilt crushed down on Asmophel's shoulders. He bowed his head, but worse thoughts followed. Winfred had been the strongest among them mentally—stronger even than Piaro. If the persecution had broken someone that resilient, what had become of the others? Were they even still alive?\n\nA sob escaped before Asmophel could contain it.\n\nHaster watched the older man break down, his own resolve wavering. This felt wrong. Two years living alongside Winfred had eroded the boundaries in his mind. These NPCs weren't just sophisticated code anymore—their pain registered as real. Authentic. Asmophel's anguish radiated like heat from a forge.\n\n*'Wrong target.'* The thought crystallized. Former Red Knights captain. Perfect test of skill. Completely wrong opponent given the circumstances.\n\n*'I should postpone this.'*\n\nHaster lowered his weapon, opened his mouth to apologize to Winfred's memory—\n\nThe ground shuddered.\n\nBoth men froze. In the distance, black smoke pillared upward from the direction of the capital city.\n\n\"War?\" Haster breathed.\n\nThen other sounds registered. Screaming. Not from the distant smoke, but from the village below. Faint but unmistakable.\n\n\"—spare me!\"\n\n\"No, please—\"\n\n\"Run! They'll kill—\"\n\n\"KYAAAAK!\"\n\nFaces flashed through Haster's mind. The woodcutter who'd shared his fire during winter storms. The clothing merchant who'd insisted he take warmer furs at cost. Children who waved enthusiastically whenever he passed. The innkeeper's daughter with her shy smile...\n\nGraphics. Pixels. Artificial intelligence.\n\nExcept the warmth had felt real. The kindness had mattered.\n\n\"Damn it!\" Haster broke into a sprint down the mountain path.\n\nThe scene below confirmed his worst fears. Soldiers ransacked homes, dragging screaming villagers into the street. Food stores burned. And above it all, a banner snapped in the wind—a massive castle emblazoned on fabric.\n\nValhalla's flag. The second player-built kingdom.\n\nHaster's legs locked mid-stride.\n\nFour years. Two searching for his master, two training under him. Four years of disciplined isolation, all for a singular purpose: unveiling his resurrection to the world at the perfect moment. Showing his fans—those who'd waited, who still remembered—that their king hadn't fallen. That he'd simply been forging himself anew.\n\nFour years of sacrifice, about to evaporate for NPCs.\n\nBut if he intervened against Valhalla players, someone would recognize him. The element of surprise would die. The grand reveal would become a footnote about saving villagers.\n\nFootsteps approached from behind.\n\nAsmophel appeared beside him, extending a weathered helmet. Plain military issue, single rod painted on the brow. The former captain wore an identical piece marked with two rods.\n\nThrough the helmet's visor, Asmophel's features blurred into anonymity. His nameplate vanished.\n\nUnderstanding dawned.\n\n\"Thank you.\" Haster accepted the helmet, bowing deeply before sliding it on. \"I'm grateful beyond words.\"\n\nThey descended together toward the chaos below.\n\nA Valhalla soldier spotted them immediately. \"Who the hell are you?\"\n\n\"A soldier.\" Asmophel's voice remained steady.\n\n\"Y-yeah. Same.\" Haster's response came less smoothly.\n\nOnly one of them was technically truthful.\n\nOasis, who'd been coordinating the pillaging operation and securing supplies, scowled at the interruption."
