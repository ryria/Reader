  "content": "**[The key fits perfectly.]**\n\n**[An effect has occurred.]**\n\n\"Yes!\" \n\nGrid twisted the universal key in the tiny hole carved into the massive tree trunk. A cheerful chime accompanied the notification, and he grinned in anticipation. This was it—the hidden mechanism that would split the tree open to reveal priceless treasures. A skill book, perhaps, containing one of the War God's secret techniques.\n\nHe waited.\n\nNothing happened.\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nThe tree stood motionless. The notification claimed an effect had occurred, but clearly something was wrong. Grid circled the trunk, searching for hidden panels or switches, then scanned the surrounding jungle. Dozens of trees stretched in every direction, and several bore similar keyholes carved into their bark.\n\n'Maybe it's random? Like a lottery? Let me try another.'\n\nHe jogged toward a neighboring tree twenty meters away.\n\n**[You have fallen into a trap!]**\n\nThe ground vanished beneath his feet the instant he stepped on a protruding root.\n\n**[You have suffered 10,200 damage!]**\n\nGrid plummeted ten meters into a concealed pit and slammed into the bottom, coughing blood. \n\n\"Shit... if that had happened mid-combat, I'd be dead.\"\n\nWho the hell trapped this place? He activated **Fly** and lifted himself out of the earthen shaft, mind racing. The empire had reached these ruins first—they must have seeded the jungle with traps to hinder anyone following. It made sense. They'd want to monopolize whatever secrets lay hidden here.\n\n'Bastards went all out.'\n\nMost players could avoid traps with enough stats and experience. Grid himself possessed high Insight, which normally made spotting snares trivial. But these? These traps blended seamlessly with the natural terrain, utterly invisible until triggered. If the empire had laid traps this sophisticated throughout the entire jungle...\n\nA leaf brushed his shoulder as he flew.\n\nIt transformed into a razor-edged blade and opened a deep gash across his arm.\n\n\"AGH!\" \n\nGrid yanked out a potion and downed it, teeth gritted. \"What kind of insane trap is *that?*\"\n\nThese weren't the sort of mechanisms you could spot by being careful. They were too advanced, too seamlessly integrated. Whoever designed them was a master—and Grid made a mental note to recruit them if he ever got the chance. After healing, he continued to the second tree and inserted the Master Key again. Another cheerful chime. Another notification claiming success.\n\nNo treasure.\n\n\"Another dud?\"\n\nStubborn determination kicked in. He checked the time—plenty left—and moved to the next tree. Same keyhole, same perfect fit, same useless result. The fourth tree, the fifth... Grid triggered three more traps along the way, burning through his potion supply and growing increasingly frustrated.\n\n\"Why isn't anything happening?!\" \n\n\"Why are you asking me, nyong?\" \n\nNoe stretched luxuriously atop Grid's head, black fur gleaming in the dappled sunlight. A cool breeze ruffled his coat, and the cat purred with utter contentment, using Grid's skull as a pillow.\n\n\"You're completely useless, you know that?\"\n\nIt was true, though not Noe's fault. After evolving from consuming the thunder stone, Noe's combat abilities had grown—but so had Grid's. Back when Grid was weaker, Noe's contributions had been invaluable. Now? Grid was strong enough that Noe's presence felt almost decorative, except in rare circumstances where the cat's unique abilities shone, like during the golem invasion's final boss. \n\nBut enemies that specialized weren't common.\n\n'And honestly, I'd rather not face anything that dangerous again.'\n\nGrid smiled despite his irritation. It didn't matter that Noe wasn't carrying his weight in combat. He liked having the cat around. That was reason enough.\n\n'Yeah, just stay happy. Run the occasional errand.'\n\nMemphis had long lifespans, didn't they? Possibly even longer than his own. And for some reason, Noe's fur had recently turned black again—not that Grid minded. He scratched behind the cat's ears affectionately, then trudged toward the next tree.\n\nSame key. Same notification. Same lack of—\n\n\"...Wait.\"\n\nGrid froze, eyes widening as he surveyed his surroundings. Several of the traps he'd encountered earlier had vanished completely—the leaf-blades gone, the pit traps filled.\n\n'Releasing traps?'\n\nUnderstanding clicked into place. He glanced at the remaining trees marked with keyholes and the pieces fell together.\n\n'The empire couldn't have installed hundreds of traps in just a few days.'\n\nThese mechanisms were *ancient*, part of the ruins' original defenses. Unlocking the keyholes didn't reveal treasure—it *disabled* the traps. Possessing the Master Key gave him a massive advantage over the imperial forces, who'd be fumbling blind through all these hazards.\n\n'Damn, this thing really does show up exactly when I need it.'\n\nThe universal key he'd crafted years ago—what a fraudulent item. He couldn't make something like this now if he tried. These days, Grid approached crafting cautiously, weighing every consideration and constraint. That process limited his imagination. His younger self had simply *created* without worrying whether something was possible.\n\n'I'd never attempt an item this broken now. I'd convince myself it couldn't be made before I even started.'\n\nSometimes you needed that reckless simplicity. A small epiphany.\n\nThe jungle sounds abruptly ceased.\n\nRustling. Footsteps approaching fast through the undergrowth.\n\n\"Overgeared King!\"\n\nThree figures burst from the foliage.\n\n**[You have discovered a strong person of this era!]**\n\n**[The Hero King's fighting energy has started to boil!]**\n\n\"—!!\"\n\nGrenhal. Morse. Basara.\n\nGrid's fighting energy ignited like a bonfire as recognition hit. Three of the empire's Seven Dukes, the same trio who'd attended that tense luncheon when Grid had visited the imperial capital. Grenhal—highest level alongside Limit and Rachel. Morse—distinctive build, impossible to forget. Basara—stunning enough that Grid remembered her despite her ignoring him throughout the entire meal.\n\n'FUCK!'\n\nThis was catastrophic. He'd disobeyed Lauel's explicit orders not to enter the jungle, and now he was staring down three of the empire's deadliest warriors. Grid's hand flew to his sword hilt, mind screaming warnings about imminent death.\n\n\"Hey! We're trying to thank you for the help!\" Morse called out, grinning.\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nThank him? Grid's confusion must have shown, because Morse gestured broadly at the surrounding jungle. Then Grid understood—they'd been struggling through this trap-riddled nightmare, and his key-turning had saved them from the worst of it.\n\n'That's why they haven't attacked?'\n\nIf these three had wanted him dead, Grid would already be a corpse. They'd had a perfect ambush opportunity and squandered it. From the empire's perspective, capturing or killing an enemy king was a war-ending achievement. Yet here they stood, making no hostile moves, because they felt they *owed* him.\n\n'The help must have been significant.'\n\nAn opportunity. He needed an excuse to extract himself from this situation alive. Grid forced his voice steady.\n\n\"Glad I could help. I was trying to be humble about it.\"\n\nHis voice trembled anyway. How could it not? These were killers who could end him in seconds. If he died here, he'd be ejected from the Red Sea entirely, unable to protect his companions or complete his objectives. The fear tasted metallic.\n\n\"*This* is the person who killed Rigal?\" Morse's expression shifted, something dangerous flickering behind his eyes.\n\nGrenhal spoke before Grid could respond. \"It happened on the battlefield.\"\n\nThe reprimand was clear: *Don't hold it against him.*\n\n\"...Fine.\" Morse's aggression deflated.\n\nGrenhal dismounted from his two-headed hippopotamus—Grid had forgotten he'd been riding the bizarre creature—and approached. He inclined his head in a slight but unmistakable salute.\n\nBoth Morse and Basara went rigid with shock. Grenhal *never* showed such deference by dismounting, not to anyone except the Emperor himself. Even Empress Marie couldn't compel him to leave his mount.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Grenhal said. \"We would have perished without Your Majesty's intervention. Though naturally, it wasn't pure altruism, was it? You assisted us for a reason.\"\n\n'Huh?'\n\nBefore Grid could formulate a response, Grenhal continued building his own narrative.\n\n\"Your Majesty's strength alone cannot overcome the War God's followers. Therefore, you engineered this meeting, intending to propose an alliance.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"It's a brilliant strategy. Your Majesty possesses the key, making cooperation invaluable to us. By maneuvering the situation this way... you're a remarkable tactician. I was foolish to underestimate you.\"\n\nGrid stood frozen as Grenhal spun complete nonsense into coherent logic.\n\n\"Indeed. Such forward-thinking insight and bold decisiveness,\" Basara agreed, nodding thoughtfully. Morse appeared deep in contemplation, clearly buying the explanation.\n\nGrenhal extended his hand. \"I propose this with my authority as an imperial duke: let us set aside our nations' war and forge a temporary alliance here. You require our martial strength. We require your key. Combined, we can navigate these ruins safely.\"\n\nGrid's mind raced. Accept? Refuse? Consult Lauel first? But there was no time, and the answer was obvious—exploring these ruins while marked as the empire's enemy would be suicidal. This was the better option.\n\n\"Agreed. Let's do it.\"\n\nTheir hands clasped, shaking firmly.\n\n\"...Hmm.\"\n\n\"...??\" \n\n\"...??\"\n\nGrenhal made a strange sound, and Morse and Basara exchanged confused glances.\n\n\"Ahem.\" Grid withdrew his hand quickly and coughed. Whatever that was about, best not to dwell on it.\n\n***\n\nAt S.A. Group headquarters, the emergency meeting had devolved into chaos.\n\n\"This is *impossible*. How did this happen?!\"\n\nStaff members crowded around monitors, faces pale with shock. The Saharan Empire was supposed to *fall*. It was foundational to Satisfy's timeline—Insane Dragon Nevartan's rampage would destroy the empire, triggering cascading storylines across the world. But then the 3rd National Competition finals had changed everything.\n\nThe empire had survived. War with the Overgeared Kingdom erupted. The butterfly effect sent Skunk to Galest, where meeting the dukes set him on a course through the Red Sea, leading to the premature discovery of the Ruins of the War God. And now, with the Overgeared Kingdom's strongest forces stranded away from the mainland...\n\nThe management team watched their carefully planned scenarios crumble.\n\nGreat Demon Berith had descended—but not in the Saharan Empire where Grid's party could respond. He'd manifested in a remote region where only fragmented player forces could mount resistance. Without the top-tier players, Berith would slaughter thousands, summon an army from hell, and drive a devastating percentage of the playerbase to quit in frustration.\n\nMeanwhile, Grid's party would waste precious time in the Ruins of the War God, unable to progress through content meant for players ten or twenty levels higher—\n\nExcept.\n\n*Except.*\n\n\"Where did he GET that key?!\" one analyst shouted. \"There's no way he assembled all the fragments this quickly!\"\n\nOn screen, Grid moved from tree to tree, methodically deactivating traps with his Master Key. Then came the meeting with the dukes. Then the alliance.\n\n\"...He's going to *clear* the ruins, isn't he?\" \n\nThe words hung in stunned silence. No one could refute them. Based on current trajectory, Grid was about to breeze through endgame content designed to be unreachable.\n\n\"Hah... hahaha!\" \n\nChairman Lim Cheolho's laughter echoed through the conference room. Grid had used a key created years ago to forge an alliance with enemy dukes. The man was extraordinary, constantly exceeding every prediction. Brilliant.\n\nThe mood shifted awkwardly as staffers realized they were being laughed at.\n\n\"Chairman.\" Director Yoon Sangmin stood abruptly. \"Should I order chicken and beer?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Half-and-half?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Understood. Two orders coming up.\" Yoon Sangmin pulled out his phone and stepped into the hallway.\n\n\"DIRECTOR YOON, ARE YOU INSANE?!\"\n\nSeveral employees turned on him immediately.\n\n\"There are twenty people here and you're ordering *two* chickens?!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nBut they'd already lost. The other staffers were settling in now, eyes glued to the monitors, ready to watch Grid's next move. The man who usually solved problems through brute force had encountered a situation where strength was useless—and somehow, *somehow*, he'd turned wisdom into his weapon instead.\n\nIt was too compelling to look away."
