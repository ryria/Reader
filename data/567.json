  "content": "# Chapter 258: The Queen of Fire and Darkness\n\nThirty-three Great Demons ruled Hell. Countless tomes and historical records documented their terrible might. Throughout history, whenever one of these monstrous entities manifested on earth, entire kingdoms crumbled to ash and humanity itself teetered on the brink of extinction.\n\nKing Aslan knew precisely how catastrophic a Great Demon could be. And yet—he had no other choice.\n\n*I sought the throne to restore the kingdom's glory,* he thought bitterly, sweat trickling down his temples. *But instead, I'm the one who'll destroy it.*\n\nThe weight of that irony crushed his chest. His hands trembled as he stared at the old comb in his palm—an artifact so mundane in appearance, yet thrumming with malevolence.\n\n*I couldn't face my brother in the underworld if I allowed this,* he thought. *Better to lose the kingdom to invaders than to damn it myself.*\n\nAnd yet... he couldn't surrender Reinhardt to Grid. Couldn't let the throne slip through his fingers. The contradiction tore at him, and in that moment of weakness, he heard it—a voice slithering into his mind like smoke through cracks.\n\n\"Your selfishness... your anxiety, your regret, your despair... Yesss, I can taste your fear, your anger. Such exquisite flavors.\" The voice was ageless, genderless, neither young nor old—a sound that bypassed his ears entirely and resonated in his bones. \"Give me pure blood. Invite me to the surface. And in return... I shall grant you *one wish*.\"\n\nKing Aslan's legs buckled. Dizziness washed over him in waves. The voice alone made his mortality feel like rotted rope—frayed threads ready to snap at any moment. Terror flooded his veins, cold and paralyzing.\n\nYet proportional to that fear was temptation. Sweet, intoxicating temptation.\n\n*One wish...*\n\nThe promise echoed in his skull, drowning out reason.\n\n\"Will you...\" His voice cracked. He swallowed hard and tried again. \"Will you *truly* fulfill my wish?\"\n\n\"I am one of the Thirty-Three Supreme Rulers of Hell.\" Pride saturated every syllable. \"I have my honor as a sovereign. My promises are absolute. Now speak. What does your withered heart desire? Eternal youth? Mountains of gold? A harem of unparalleled beauties?\"\n\n\"No.\" The word burst from King Aslan with unexpected vehemence. He didn't want youth. Didn't want riches or women. Only one thing mattered. \"Make my kingdom the supreme power on this continent! My descendants will *never* suffer the humiliation I've endured! I want my bloodline praised as the greatest in all the world!\"\n\nSilence.\n\nThen—laughter. Low, delighted, utterly inhuman.\n\n\"Kukuku... Deep inferiority produces the sweetest fruit. Very well. I accept your wish.\"\n\nThe price crystallized in King Aslan's mind. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine virgins. Their blood would pave the way for this Great Demon's arrival.\n\nHis jaw clenched. His fists shook.\n\nThen he made his choice.\n\n\"Bring the virgins!\" he roared.\n\n> [The quest 'Summoning the Great Demon (Final Part)' will soon be completed.]\n\nFrom her hidden vantage point, Black Magician Rose watched the quest notification appear. Her lips curled into a manic grin.\n\n\"Heheh...\"\n\n***\n\n\"It wasn't a short amount of time,\" Lauel murmured, surveying Reinhardt's walls from horseback. \"In terms of a player's journey, it's practically an eternity.\"\n\nTwo years. He'd followed Grid for two years in the real world. In Satisfy, that translated to six long years. In that time, Lauel had orchestrated the absorption of the Tzedakah Guild, laid the foundation for Overgeared's power structure, and guided its expansion to the formidable force it was today.\n\n*Without me, there would be no Overgeared Guild,* he thought, though not with arrogance—simply truth. *And yet...*\n\nHis chest tightened with something deeper than pride.\n\n*I'm fortunate beyond measure to serve the lord of my destiny.*\n\nLauel had initially allied himself with Grid purely for pragmatic reasons. A legendary blacksmith could attract talent, build armies, generate wealth. But Grid had exceeded every expectation. His growth wasn't limited to smithing—he'd evolved in every dimension, transforming from a skilled craftsman into a force of nature.\n\nThanks to that, Overgeared's rise had outpaced even Lauel's most optimistic projections. Now they stood on the precipice of true greatness.\n\n*Kingdom-building,* Lauel thought, exhilaration coursing through him. *We're one step away.*\n\nReinhardt sprawled before him—a city one and a half times larger than Reidan, population eight hundred thousand, protected by towering walls and deep moats. Its defenses could theoretically withstand a million-strong army.\n\nBut Lauel didn't flinch. He *knew* Reinhardt's weakness.\n\n*The interior is hollow,* he calculated coldly. *Most of their forces are deployed to attack our territories. Fewer than ten thousand troops remain—probably eight thousand if you count security guards and royal knights.*\n\nHis own army numbered only three thousand elite soldiers equipped with Grid's mass-production gear. But quality trumped quantity. He had Faker. Ibellin. Jude wielding Dainsleif. And the trump card—Great Magician Ashur and his son Bland.\n\nBut that wasn't all.\n\n\"The reinforcements from Siren have arrived!\" a scout called.\n\n\"The *Water Clan King* Maxong has come in person!\"\n\nLauel's pulse quickened. Maxong strode forward, his scaled skin glistening with moisture, five hundred warriors at his back.\n\n\"I have come to repay your grace,\" Maxong declared, his voice resonating with power. When he'd fought Grid, he'd been mentally compromised—yet still overwhelmingly strong. Now, fully recovered, he was a living catastrophe.\n\n\"Piaro has returned!\" another voice shouted.\n\nThe legendary farmer appeared, scratching his head sheepishly. \"I developed a sea-growing bean, but there's no taste... The Water Clan won't eat it.\"\n\nLauel nearly laughed. The ultimate powerhouse beyond even Grid himself, casually discussing agricultural failures.\n\n\"Reinforcements from the Rebecca Church have arrived!\"\n\n\"It's His Holiness!\"\n\nPope Damian strolled up with characteristic nonchalance. \"Hi everyone.\" His gaze swept the assembled forces. \"Where's Grid?\"\n\nOne of Rebecca's Daughters, Isabel, walked beside him, her presence radiating holy power. With Damian's wide-area buffs, Overgeared's elite would become unstoppable.\n\n\"An army has arrived from Pedro!\"\n\n\"Earl Chris and his subordinates!\"\n\nChris dismounted, arms crossed. \"If we help build Grid's kingdom, we can request item commissions? Then there's no reason not to help.\"\n\nDamian. Chris—leader of one of the Seven Guilds. The continent's strongest players had converged.\n\nLauel surveyed them all and felt absolute certainty crystallize.\n\n\"Now I can easily conquer Reinhardt,\" he murmured, \"even without releasing my sealed power.\"\n\nIt was true. Every member of Overgeared had exceeded expectations. Peak Sword defending Cork Island. Yura and Pon holding Bairan. Katz in Borneo. Jishuka at Patrian. Each one had bled Eternal's forces dry, leaving Reinhardt vulnerable.\n\n*Everyone is magnificent,* Lauel thought, pride swelling in his chest.\n\nOnly one regret lingered. Grid's premature return to the West Continent. Lauel had wanted to prove he could conquer Reinhardt alone—to give Grid a kingdom as a gift.\n\n*But Grid seems to be in danger right now.*\n\nGrid had inquired about Bairan's situation a day ago, then gone silent. Knowing Grid's sense of responsibility, he'd likely charged into Bairan alone.\n\n*He's probably surrounded by a hundred thousand troops this very moment.*\n\nEven for Grid, those odds were deadly.\n\n*We need to hurry. Conquer Reinhardt, then race to Bairan.*\n\nLauel raised his sword high.\n\n\"Full assault!\"\n\n\"Jude. Go. City wall. Crush.\"\n\n\"This land has excellent soil for farming.\"\n\n\"Let's eat this hot potato before it becomes cold.\"\n\n\"Why don't I see Grid?\"\n\n\"Isabel is beautiful, even when she can't forget her first love.\"\n\nChris glanced around at the eccentric gathering and thought, *...How are all these people gathered here?* Not many normal individuals in this bunch.\n\nBut they were some of the strongest beings on the continent. Their momentum could pierce the heavens.\n\n**BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!**\n\nNyangmong's massive tamed beasts slammed into Reinhardt's gates like siege engines.\n\n\"Neutralize those who resist,\" Earl Ashur intoned, his hands weaving intricate patterns. Wide-area magic rippled across the walls, causing archers to drop their bows as paralysis seized their limbs.\n\n\"Free Farming 2nd Style—Rapid Growth!\"\n\n**KWARURURUNG!**\n\nPiaro scattered seeds across the earth. Within seconds, enormous vines erupted from the soil and shot up Reinhardt's walls like grasping fingers.\n\n*Sususuk...*\n\nAs the vines climbed, Ibellin and the Overgeared soldiers scaled them with frightening speed, overwhelming the defenders atop the ramparts.\n\n\"Jude. Kill. A lot.\"\n\n\"Take this greatsword!\"\n\nJude and Chris spun their massive blades like windmills, carving through enemy formations. Pope Damian chanted ceaselessly, layering buff after buff onto his allies. Meanwhile, King Maxong and his warriors dove into the moat and disappeared—only to emerge inside the city, systematically assassinating enemy commanders.\n\nViewer reactions flooded the broadcast channels:\n\n—*What am I seeing right now? The Overgeared Guild is a players' guild, right? What's this?*\n\n—*Even the soldiers are insane;;*\n\n—*I'm sorry to break the admiring atmosphere, but what is that NPC doing? ㅋㅋㅋ Why is he farming on a battlefield?*\n\n—*The Water Clan King is crazy. Not spilling a single drop of blood no matter how many soldiers he faces...*\n\n—*The rumor that Overgeared acquired Siren is true...*\n\n—*Earl Ashur is too much. One hand gesture causes instant death.*\n\n—*He isn't one of the continent's Ten Great Magicians for nothing. But how did Grid acquire so many NPCs?*\n\n—*Forget the NPCs. Chris is helping Overgeared for some reason.*\n\n—*Doesn't Chris have the same weapon as Grid? I'm sure there's some type of deal between them.*\n\n—*Damian is shouting 'God Grid' today.*\n\n—*The Pope is a bit...*\n\n—*Rebecca's Daughter is so pretty. She's prettier than everyone apart from Yura and Jishuka.*\n\n—*Isabel ㅋㅋㅋ*\n\n\"Perfect! It's perfect!\"\n\nLauel climbed onto the captured walls, surveying the battlefield. Excitement thrummed through him as Overgeared's dominance became undeniable.\n\nThen he saw it.\n\n\"This...?\"\n\nHis blood turned to ice.\n\nTen thousand young women stood in precise rows before the palace. The Overgeared forces, charging toward the palace to capture King Aslan, froze in their tracks.\n\nThe women wept. Their bodies trembled with terror.\n\nEveryone stopped.\n\nEveryone except Jude.\n\n\"Jude. King. Catch.\"\n\n*Step.*\n\nJude, his greatsword dripping crimson, advanced toward the palace. King Aslan stood on the balcony, sweat pouring down his face, his expression twisted with desperate hesitation.\n\nThen he squeezed his eyes shut and screamed:\n\n\"*FIRE!*\"\n\nKnights loyal to their monarch, bound by oaths beyond reason, hurled torches at the ten thousand terrified women.\n\n**HWARURUK!**\n\nFlames erupted instantly. The women—drenched in oil—became pillars of fire. Their screams tore through Reinhardt like the wails of the damned.\n\n\"Crazy...!\" someone choked out.\n\nThe Overgeared forces stood paralyzed, faces drained of color, unable to comprehend the cruelty unfolding before them.\n\nThen—\n\n> [The 32nd Great Demon **Belial** has appeared.]\n>\n> [You are deceived by Belial's beautiful appearance.]\n>\n> [**Resistance to Status Conditions** has dropped by **50%**!]\n>\n> [Skill and magic **Casting Time** have **doubled**. **Attack Speed** is reduced by **20%**.]\n>\n> [Belial is the **Queen of Fire**. The flames surrounding her are intensely hot. You will receive **2,000 Burn Damage per second** once you approach her.]\n>\n> [**Fire Resistance** is **0%**.]\n>\n> [The overwhelming heat will cause **500 Burn Damage per second**. It cannot be resisted.]\n>\n> [Belial is the **Queen of Darkness**. The demonic energy she emits seduces your mind and stimulates murderous desire. When attacking Belial, there is a **high chance** of falling into the **Confused** state and attacking your allies.]\n>\n> [**Dark Magic Resistance** is **0%**.]\n>\n> [Use of **Black Magic** is blocked.]\n\nThe air itself seemed to scream.\n\nAn entity beyond mortal comprehension materialized above the burning pyre. The Overgeared Guild—and the entire watching world—could only stare in horror.\n\n***\n\nIn an abandoned watchtower on Reinhardt's outskirts, Prince Benoit observed the Great Demon's manifestation. His expression soured.\n\n*Failure.*\n\nThis wasn't the demon he'd wanted. Out of thirty-three possibilities, the odds of success on the first attempt were always slim. Still, disappointment gnawed at him.\n\nHe turned away from Reinhardt, his mind already shifting to the next objective.\n\n*Kesan Canyon,* he thought. *Piaro's likely hiding place.*\n\n*I need the Amethyst Shield.*\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, in Seoul, South Korea...\n\n\"Kan jajang... so much...\" Shin Youngwoo mumbled around a mouthful of delicious Chinese food. The fatigue that had accumulated over the past days melted away with each bite.\n\nHe glanced at the clock.\n\nTwo hours remained before his Satisfy access restriction lifted."
