Four chances to salvage this disaster.\n\n*I'm not stopping until this works.*\n\nThe dagger materialized in my grip, and I fed it another stone.\n\n> [A weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]\n> \n> [The +4 <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Ideal Dagger</span> has been strengthened.]\n\nMy breath caught. Then another.\n\n> [A weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]\n> \n> [The +5 <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Ideal Dagger</span> has been strengthened.]\n\n*Yes. Yes!*\n\nOne more. Just one more to reach +6, where the aura would manifest. Where people would *see* my power.\n\n> [A weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]\n> \n> [You have failed to strengthen the +5 <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Ideal Dagger</span>.]\n> \n> [The +5 <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Ideal Dagger</span> has decreased by 3.]\n\n\"Dammit!\"\n\nThe weapon in my hand felt like a stone. +2. Back to +2. I was Pagma's Descendant. A legendary blacksmith. Failure at +6 was an insult to everything I represented.\n\n\"Damn... damn!\"\n\nOne thousand gold for ten stones. The math was brutal. +3 was all I had to show for it. Unacceptable.\n\nThe auction house interface opened with a thought. My fingers moved without hesitation. Another ten stones. Another thousand gold burning through my account.\n\n*If this fails again, I'm using the blessed stones.* \n\nThe blessed enhancement stones sat in my inventory like insurance. Too expensive to use casually. I'd planned to sell them, recoup some losses. But pride was a hungry beast.\n\nI gripped the dagger. Fed it stone after stone. Watched the numbers climb. +3. +4. +5.\n\n*Please.*\n\n> [A weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]\n> \n> [The +5 <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Ideal Dagger</span> has been strengthened.]\n\n\"Oh...! Ohh!!\"\n\nBlue light erupted from the blade. Not the pale translucence of mana, but a vivid sapphire glow that coiled around the metal like living water. It was gorgeous. It was *mine*.\n\n\"Beautiful...\"\n\nBelow +6, enhancements were invisible. A +0 weapon looked identical to a +5. But at +6, the world could see your investment. Your commitment. Your power.\n\n*Everyone needs to witness this.*\n\n***\n\nThe central square hummed with afternoon traffic. Merchants hawking wares. Adventurers comparing equipment. I planted myself in the center, near the fountain, and struck a pose. One hand on my hip. The other holding the <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Ideal Dagger</span> aloft, letting the blue aura catch the sunlight.\n\nHeads turned immediately.\n\n\"Wow, look at that weapon! It's at least +6!\"\n\n\"It has a blue aura. Really beautiful...\"\n\nA woman with a staff paused mid-stride. \"He must be rich to enhance a weapon to +6. Should I tempt him once?\"\n\nHer companion grabbed her arm. \"Hey, he might just be lucky with the enhancement. Don't act too carelessly.\"\n\n\"Wow... this is the first time I've seen a +6 weapon.\" A young warrior stared openly. \"Mine is only +3. I'm envious.\"\n\nHeat flooded my chest. Validation. Recognition. This was what I'd earned.\n\n*Huhuhu... a +6 weapon is truly special. Worth every copper.*\n\nI held the pose longer. Turned slightly to give everyone a better angle. Some users started taking screenshots. Perfect.\n\nThen the whispers changed. Admiration curdled into something else. People glanced at me, then away. A few snickered.\n\n\"Is he... just going to stand there?\"\n\n\"Bit much, isn't it?\"\n\nMy face burned. I lowered the dagger.\n\n\"Bah, boasting like this when you only have a lowly +6 dagger.\"\n\nThe voice cut through the square's ambient noise like a blade. I spun.\n\n*No.*\n\n\"Katz!\"\n\n\"Blood Warrior Katz!\"\n\nThe crowd erupted. Bodies pressed closer. Katz strode through the parting masses like royalty, black coat billowing. I knew his face from broadcasts. Third Epic class. Top 40 ranked. A celebrity who thrived on controversy and excess.\n\nHe stopped three paces away. Looked me up and down. His lips curled.\n\n\"Heh... you are too vulgar.\"\n\n\"What are you implying all of a sudden?\" My grip tightened on the dagger's hilt.\n\nKatz shrugged. Then his hand moved to his waist. Steel sang free of leather.\n\nThe blade erupted in light. Not blue. Not green or purple. *Orange.* Brilliant, searing orange that pulsed like a miniature sun. The heat of it felt real. I had to squint.\n\nThe square fell silent. Then the noise came all at once.\n\n\"Is that...?\"\n\n\"No way.\"\n\n\"+8! That's a +8 weapon!\"\n\n\"Puhahaha!\" Katz's laugh was theatrical, practiced. \"How about it? Isn't this different? This is the majesty of a +8 weapon! A stupendous weapon that a person like you can't get your hands on for all your life! Puhahaha!\"\n\nHe sheathed the blade with a flourish. Turned. Walked away with measured, arrogant steps.\n\nThe crowd watched him go. Murmurs rippled outward.\n\n\"What is this? Did he come just to show off his item?\"\n\n\"He's just like the rumors say...\"\n\n\"My god.\"\n\nPeople clicked their tongues. Shook their heads. Dispersed. Went back to their lives.\n\nI couldn't move. My legs were stone. My hands trembled.\n\n*That bastard.* The words repeated in my skull like a drumbeat. *He dared disgrace me? He is just an epic class, yet he talks such nonsense to a legendary class?*\n\nThe humiliation was acid. It ate through my triumph, left nothing but raw, throbbing shame.\n\n***\n\nI stormed back to Khan's smithy. Threw open my inventory. Two blessed weapon enhancement stones glowed in the corner of my storage.\n\n\"I am Pagma's Descendant.\" My voice echoed in the empty workshop. \"Blood Warrior? Screw him!\"\n\nThe first stone crumbled between my fingers. Light absorbed into the dagger.\n\n> [The blessed weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]\n> \n> [The +6 <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Ideal Dagger</span> has been strengthened.]\n\nNo hesitation. The second stone followed.\n\n> [The blessed weapon enhancement stone (1) has been consumed.]\n> \n> [The +7 <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Ideal Dagger</span> has been strengthened.]\n\nBlue light intensified. Deepened. The aura thickened until it resembled liquid. Then.\n\n> [The item enhancement value is +8, so the option effect is slightly increased.]\n\n\"...Eh?\"\n\nTwo blessed stones. Two consecutive successes. The odds were astronomical. But the proof burned in my hand. The blue aura no longer flickered. It flowed, constant and brilliant, like staring into ocean depths.\n\n*If Katz' sword was like the sun, then mine is the sea.*\n\n\"Hah...! Hahahaha! Puhahaha!\"\n\nI pulled up the item description with shaking fingers.\n\n---\n\n**[+8 <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Ideal Dagger</span>]**\n\nRating: Unique  \nDurability: 168/168  \nAttack Power: 378~413  \nAttack Speed: +13%\n\n* There is a rare chance of instantaneously killing the target.  \n* **Agility +30**  \n* The skill **'Wind Blast'** is generated.  \n* The skill **'Quick Movements'** is generated.\n\n*A dagger created by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but lacks experience and reputation.

You arrogant bastard.*\n\nThe door creaked. Huroi stepped inside, eyes bright. \"My Liege! What happened with the raid?\"\n\nI studied him for a moment. The raid had been successful. Spectacularly so. My inventory bulged with loot.\n\nBut Huroi would want a share. That was logical. Fair, even.\n\n*No.*\n\n\"Um... unfortunately, the raid failed, so there are no items.\" I arranged my face into something apologetic. \"I'm sorry about the result, despite your courageous sacrifice.\"\n\nHuroi's expression crumbled. He actually swayed on his feet. \"It is because I was incompetent. Kuock...\" His hand formed a fist over his heart. \"I will now leave to train! So that next time, I am able to help My Liege!\"\n\n\"Y-Yes...\"\n\nHe practically ran from the smithy. Guilt whispered at the edges of my thoughts. I crushed it.\n\n*Focus. Kesan Canyon awaits.*\n\nI had the <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Ideal Dagger</span> now. Khan was finishing my armor. All that remained were gauntlets and boots. I pulled out my hammer.\n\nTwo days vanished into the rhythm of metalwork.\n\n***\n\nThe forge's heat had become a second skin. I quenched the final piece, watched steam hiss upward.\n\n---\n\n**[<span class=\"rarity-epic\">Khan's Masterpiece</span>]**\n\nRating: Epic  \nDurability: 300/300  \nDefense: 359  \nMovement Speed: -7%\n\n* 20% reduction in damage from physical attacks.\n\n*This armor is made using the know-how that the best blacksmith in the north of the Eternal Kingdom, Khan, accumulated in his life.*\n\n*The inner armor made from the leather of the frostlight orc absorbs impact from the outside well.*\n\n*Khan proudly calls this armor the masterpiece of his life.*\n\n**User Restriction:** Level 160 or higher.

More than 150 agility.\n\n**Weight:** 220\n\n---\n\n**[<span class=\"rarity-rare\">Adventurer's Boots</span>]**\n\nRating: Rare  \nDurability: 120/120  \nDefense: 60  \nMovement Speed: +6%\n\n*An item made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.*\n\n*It is comfortable to wear. Ideal for long-distance travel.*\n\n**User Restriction:** Level 160 or higher.\n\n**Weight:** 200\n\n---\n\n\"Okay, this is perfect!\" I equipped each piece, felt the familiar weight settle into place. \"I made an epic and rare item and got my stats, so should I go?\"\n\nKesan Canyon. The name alone made my jaw tight.\n\n***\n\nThe canyon mouth yawned before me. Red stone. Deep shadows. The wind carried a smell like old blood and dust.\n\n\"I came here only to die, die and die...\"\n\nNightmares. Actual nightmares. Kesan Canyon had infected my sleep for weeks. The grotesque monsters. The inescapable geography. The constant, grinding failure.\n\n*I won't sleep peacefully until this place is conquered.*\n\n\"The monsters here are so weird...\"\n\nCanyon lizardmen with their crude armor. The giant spiders. *God, the spiders.*\n\nImages flashed unbidden. Thick webs. Mandibles the size of my torso. Being unable to move, unable to scream, as something massive and many-legged descended. The horrible intimacy of dying in a predator's mouth.\n\n*At least it was fast. Head went first.*\n\nI shuddered. Shook my head violently.\n\n\"Stop wasting time on useless thoughts and find Pagma's swordsmanship.\"\n\nThe past was data. Information. I'd died here countless times when I was weak. Undergeared. Inexperienced.\n\n\"Now I am different!\" My voice bounced off canyon walls. \"I will show you the power of items, you monsters! Revenge! Revenge!\"\n\nI stepped forward. My legs trembled.\n\n*Dammit.*\n\nFear lived in the body. Memory carved grooves deeper than logic. I was stronger now. Better equipped. But my hands still shook. My breath still came too fast.\n\n*Move. Just move.*\n\nI forced one foot in front of the other. Descended into the canyon's throat.\n\nThe shadows swallowed me whole."
