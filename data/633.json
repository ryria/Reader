His crime? Refusing to betray your whereabouts to the king. Rescue the Han Seokbong father and daughter, who chose loyalty to you over their own country.*\n\n**Quest Clear Conditions:** Meet with the Cho King, or rescue the Han Seokbong father and daughter by force.\n\n**Class Quest Clear Reward:** Unknown\n\n**Quest Failure:** Death of the Han Seokbong father and daughter\n\n---\n\nHidden quests lived up to their name—they were never easy. Triggering one required meeting far more stringent conditions than ordinary quests. Grid's current situation was the culmination of countless choices: his connection with White led him to the blacksmithing competition. Success in forging the Red Phoenix Bow granted him access to the royal castle's dungeon. Defeating Arube saved Pangea from catastrophe. Without this precise chain of actions, the quest would never have materialized.\n\n*'Hidden quests typically offer substantial rewards.'*\n\nHe should have been ecstatic. Instead, a knot of guilt tightened in Grid's chest. Han Seokbong and Sua were in danger because of him.\n\n*'If I fail, they die.'*\n\nThe weight of other lives bearing down on the quest outcome pressed against him like a physical force.\n\n*'Especially Sua, who's so...'*\n\nGrid paused mid-thought, his face suddenly burning. He'd just realized he was still holding Yang Fei in his arms.\n\n\"G-Grid...\"\n\nYang Fei had her face buried against his chest like a startled squirrel—small, soft, delicate. Grid's complexion turned scarlet as he quickly stepped back.\n\n*'When did I become comfortable with physical contact like this?'*\n\nSince when had touching women felt this natural?\n\n*'This is... progress.'*\n\nHad his latent Casanova qualities finally surfaced?\n\n*'If I keep this momentum going, maybe I won't be single in the real world much longer...'*\n\nGrid allowed himself a moment of optimism before reality reasserted itself.\n\n*'This isn't the time for these thoughts.'*\n\nUrgency flooded back. His window of opportunity on the East Continent was rapidly closing.\n\n*'I need to rescue Han Seokbong and his daughter immediately, then secure them as allies.'*\n\nDecision made, Grid headed for Idan's restaurant with Yang Fei in tow.\n\n---\n\n\"What? You want me as your *exclusive* chef?\"\n\nThe restaurant sat empty despite the lunch hour. Idan stared at Grid in disbelief. The mysterious foreigner had vanished days ago, only to reappear with this sudden proposal.\n\n\"Listen... I appreciate you finding my frying pan. You're one of the rare gourmets who actually enjoys my cooking. I feel genuine affection toward you.\" Idan crossed his arms. \"But I can't accept.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"For starters, I don't know who you are. Your identity, your homeland—nothing. How can I become someone's personal chef when I don't even know what country they represent or what they stand for?\"\n\n\"So you're saying if I reveal my identity, you'll reconsider?\"\n\n\"It's not just that.\" Idan's voice carried a note of pride. \"I have my own aspirations as a chef. I run this restaurant because I want to share my cuisine with the world. I dream of seeing hundreds, thousands of guests savoring my dishes every single day. I'm sorry, but cooking for one person doesn't align with my vision.\"\n\n\"Hundreds and thousands of guests when you barely get two visitors?\" Yang Fei interjected. \"And even those two demanded refunds...\"\n\nIdan pointedly ignored her.\n\n\"Anyway, the answer is no. I won't be your chef.\"\n\nThe moment Idan finished his refusal, Grid's entire demeanor shifted.\n\n\"I understand. Then let me rephrase the question—will you become a chef for my *kingdom* instead of my personal chef?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nA chef for a kingdom? More importantly—*his* kingdom?\n\n\"What are you... Wait, what?\"\n\nIdan's confusion transformed into astonishment. Yang Fei's eyes widened as Grid produced a silver crown from his inventory.\n\n\"You're...?\"\n\nEverything changed in that instant. Grid's bearing, his tone, even the air around him—all of it radiated authority. Idan and Yang Fei exchanged uncertain glances as discomfort gave way to awe. Grid regarded them both with complete sincerity.\n\n\"I am the ruler of the Overgeared Kingdom on the West Continent—Overgeared King Grid. Idan, as the finest chef the East Continent has to offer, I need you to feed my tens of thousands of soldiers. Will you accept my request?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nThe moment Grid called him the finest chef on the East Continent, Idan made his choice. Excitement overtook him as he immediately began gathering his belongings—a small bundle of clothes and his cherished frying pan.\n\n\"Let's depart for the West Continent at once!\"\n\nIdan's enthusiasm contrasted sharply with Yang Fei's silence. Sadness settled over her as reality crystallized—this man existed in an entirely different world from hers.\n\n*'He was always beyond my reach.'*\n\nThey were never meant to be together. Now they would part. Yang Fei lowered her head, fighting back tears.\n\n\"Look at me.\"\n\nGrid's large hand gently lifted her small face. Yang Fei trembled at the touch, managing a fragile smile despite her heartache.\n\n\"I want Yang Fei by my side as well. Don't you have family depending on you? If I provide for them, will you come to my kingdom?\"\n\n\"I... thank you. I'm so glad...\"\n\n---\n\n*[Idan has been recruited! The chef whose food occasionally grants stat bonuses will now prepare meals for the Overgeared soldiers. Meanwhile, Yang Fei, with her exceptional work ethic, keen sense of responsibility, and talent for reading people, joins as well. Her future title: the mysterious 'Demon Maid Yang Fei.']* \n\n---\n\nYakumo's Labyrinth.\n\nThe dungeon's difficulty was legendary—party entry was prohibited, and both the maze structure and boss patterns changed with every attempt. Even third advancement classes only achieved an 11.6% success rate. Nine out of every ten challengers failed.\n\nHowever—\n\n[You have cleared Yakumo's Labyrinth!]\n\n[Clear time: 39 hours, 32 minutes, 27 seconds!]\n\n[New record established! You have obtained Yakumo's Ring (6) as a reward!]\n\n\"Still not the fourth ring.\"\n\nSword Saint Kraugel stood before the entrance, contemplating his achievement. He hadn't even reached level 300, yet he'd just set a new record. More remarkably, this was already his *sixth* ring. Yakumo's Ring was awarded for each new record, with eight distinct variants offering different options.\n\n*'According to the information I've gathered, the fourth ring has the exact stats I need. I'll have to challenge it again.'*\n\n\"Kraugel.\"\n\nA familiar voice interrupted his thoughts as he prepared to re-enter. Hao approached with measured steps. Kraugel offered a slight smile.\n\n\"I appreciate your concern, but my decision is final. No matter your objections, I'm moving to the United States.\"\n\nThe U.S. government had offered something other nations couldn't—a genuine vision for his mother's health and happiness. They'd discussed more than money and prestige; they'd understood what mattered. That sincerity had won Kraugel's heart.\n\n\"I can't honor your wish for me to relocate to South Korea or China.\"\n\nHao nodded, his expression serene. \"I'm not here to argue. I came to say I respect and support your choice.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThis caught Kraugel off guard. Hao was notoriously stubborn. What had caused this overnight transformation?\n\n\"I visited South Korea to meet with Grid,\" Hao explained. \"I wanted to convince him to persuade you against moving to the United States. He refused. He said I shouldn't oppose a choice that would make you happy.\"\n\n\"Grid said that?\"\n\n\"Yes. Honestly, I couldn't understand his reasoning. I was convinced you'd be happier in South Korea or China. Then he took me to a Chinese restaurant.\"\n\n\"...A Chinese restaurant?\"\n\n\"Indeed. Sounds absurd, doesn't it? I was actually irritated at the prospect of eating Chinese food in South Korea.\" A warm smile crossed Hao's face. \"But the moment I tasted the jjampong, everything changed. The way Chinese culinary traditions can be reinterpreted abroad, infused with new character while maintaining their essence... it's genuinely beautiful.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"I realized something in that moment. Dishes like jajangmyeon and jjampong thrive in South Korea. They've found happiness there. And...\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"People are the same. We aren't bound by nationality. You should pursue happiness wherever you're recognized and valued.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Kraugel, I now fully understand and respect your decision. It's thanks to Grid teaching me this lesson through food.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Did Grid really intend such profound meaning when he took Hao out for jjampong?*\n\nKraugel knew Grid's personality well enough to suspect otherwise. The irony wasn't lost on him—Grid's unintentional wisdom had inadvertently reinforced Kraugel's decision not to move to South Korea.\n\n*'Grid... I look forward to the day we face each other again.'*\n\nTheir current score stood at one win apiece. What would the tiebreaker bring?\n\n---\n\nThe capital of the Cho Kingdom, Kars. \n\nToday, the Lava Prison housing the kingdom's most dangerous criminals buzzed with unusual activity. Guards scrambled to prepare for an unprecedented visit from the Cho King himself.\n\n\"Why is His Majesty coming to this wretched place?\"\n\n\"It's because of the Han Seokbong father and daughter. Han Seokbong was once highly favored by the king, you know.\"\n\nCenturies ago, a volcanic eruption had created this natural prison. Cleaning it properly was nearly impossible—one mistake near the molten rock meant death. Yet with the king's visit imminent, the guards had no choice. They swept floors as best they could, scrubbed dried blood from torture chambers, and positioned fans to combat the oppressive heat radiating from the lava flows.\n\nFinally, the moment arrived.\n\n\"Presenting His Majesty!\"\n\nThe announcement echoed through the vast caverns formed by ancient fire. The Cho King traversed the sweltering corridors until he stood before Han Seokbong's cell.\n\n\"Seokbong, will you still not tell me where Grid can be found?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty... I cannot tell you... because I don't *know* his whereabouts...\"\n\n\"Still denying it to the end... This saddens me, Seokbong. There has always been loyalty between us. We were childhood friends before we were ever sovereign and subject.\"\n\n\"It's not denial. I truly don't know where he is...\"\n\n\"Yes, Seokbong. I understand your intentions, but honestly, I find them excessive. I seek this blacksmith purely for the Cho Kingdom's future. Yet you choose personal righteousness over your kingdom in crisis. That noble heart of yours has turned cold.\"\n\n\"No, Your Majesty. I genuinely don't know his whereabouts...\"\n\n\"Say nothing more. I'll give up on you. I know your nature too well. *Sigh*... I suppose this is your charm. Very well—together, we'll watch the Cho Kingdom's destruction.\"\n\n\"...I don't know.\"\n\nHan Seokbong felt himself going mad. Initially, he'd refused to reveal Grid's location out of concern for the foreigner's safety. But now he understood *why* the king sought Grid. Han Seokbong *wanted* to tell his sovereign where Grid could be found.\n\nBut how could he provide an answer he didn't possess? How could he reveal what he didn't know?\n\n*'Has Heaven abandoned both me and the Cho Kingdom?'*\n\nHan Seokbong wept as despair consumed him."
