The phenomenon made sense. Billions of people either played Satisfy or built their livelihoods around it.\n\n\"I read an article about the economic effects of the National Competition.\"\n\nYoon Sangmin, Director of Operations at S.A. Group, sat across from one of the world's busiest men. Shin Youngwoo lifted his coffee cup, face unreadable.\n\nThey'd met at Cafe XX in Geumcheon-gu. Not the Ritz. Not some corporate conference room. A neighborhood coffee shop where the espresso machine hissed too loudly and the chairs didn't match.\n\n\"The S.A. Group recognizes the potential.\" Yoon Sangmin leaned forward, hands folded on the table. \"We want to expand the Competition's reach every year. To that end, we're prepared to make our largest investment yet.\"\n\nYoungwoo sipped his coffee. Said nothing.\n\n\"We're offering unparalleled benefits to participants. Far beyond what we provided last year.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nYoon Sangmin's smile grew. \"In other words, we want to convince you, Shin Youngwoo, to participate in the Second National Competition.\"\n\nYoungwoo set down his cup. \"Please persuade me.\"\n\n*Finally.* Relief washed through Yoon Sangmin. He straightened. \"It's simple. We're increasing the value of each medal.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Last year, governments paid prize money. That was it.\" Yoon Sangmin pulled out his tablet. \"From the Second Competition onward, S.A. Group will provide rewards directly. Special items for medalists.\"\n\n\"What performance?\"\n\n*He's interested.* \"Since Pagma's Descendant falls in the blacksmith category, you'll be able to acquire the god mineral adamantium. The higher your medal placement, the more you receive.\"\n\nYoungwoo's eyes widened. His coffee cup clinked against the saucer.\n\nAdamantium.\n\nThe best mineral in existence. No will, but performance comparable to pavranium. The Holy Light Set that Pagma crafted used it as a base material. *I have no idea how to obtain it otherwise.* With adamantium, he could design items that currently existed only in his imagination. More diversity. More power.\n\nThis wasn't a reward he could pass up.\n\nYoon Sangmin watched Shin Youngwoo tremble. Time to apply pressure.\n\n\"Of course, medals won't come easy.\" He swiped through his tablet. \"The Second Competition is fundamentally different from the First. For a country as weak in Satisfy as South Korea, aiming for medals is virtually impossible.\"\n\nYoungwoo's expression froze.\n\nWeak?\n\nHe, Yura, and Peak Sword formed Overgeared's core. Three of the world's strongest players, and this man called their country weak?\n\nUnacceptable.\n\nThe old Youngwoo would've exploded. Would've declared his participation on the spot, consequences be damned. But Youngwoo had evolved.\n\n*There's a reason I kept my name off the participant list until the deadline.*\n\nHe'd won three gold medals in the First Competition. Placed South Korea third in the overall rankings. The world watched, waiting to see what he'd do next. Whether he liked it or not, he'd become a symbol.\n\nLauel's advice echoed in his mind. *Ask to be treated as a symbol. South Korea and S.A. Group will bend over backward to recruit you. Stand firm.*\n\n\"Director Yoon.\" Youngwoo's voice remained level. Calm. \"Let's be direct.\"\n\nYoon Sangmin blinked. This wasn't the reaction he'd expected. *Interesting.* But he hadn't become a director at his age by showing surprise. His smile didn't waver. \"Speak.\"\n\n\"Give the Overgeared Guild permission to direct the opening ceremony.\"\n\nThe smile cracked.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You heard me. Overgeared directs the opening for the National Competition.\"\n\n*This little...* Yoon Sangmin's jaw worked. Billions of people would watch the opening. Youngwoo wanted to hand that stage to specific users? To his guild?\n\nAbsurd.\n\nIf anyone else had made this demand, Yoon Sangmin would've laughed in their face and walked out. But Shin Youngwoo represented Satisfy's potential. Living proof that the game could transform people. The S.A. Group had invested too much in that narrative to dismiss him.\n\n\"What's the reason for this absurd request?\"\n\n\"Guild promotion.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"You heard me. Guild promotion.\"\n\nYoon Sangmin stared. \"Overgeared already has a reputation as one of the best guilds. You don't need marketing.\"\n\n\"That's the problem.\" Youngwoo's fingers drummed on the table. \"One of the best. Overgeared should be unique. Exclusive. We want people to understand that.\"\n\n*He's serious.* Yoon Sangmin ran calculations in his head. \"Let me understand. You want to use an opening that billions will watch to advertise your guild?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nWhat Yoon Sangmin didn't know was that Youngwoo channeled Lauel's strategy. In Satisfy, the ultimate content was kingdom building. Overgeared existed for one purpose: to make Youngwoo a king.\n\nBuilding and defending a kingdom required overwhelming national power. It meant deterring foreign aggression. And while seven major guilds posed threats, countless smaller forces harbored ambitions. The opening ceremony would display Overgeared's majesty. A warning written in fire and steel.\n\nLauel's thoughts buzzed through Youngwoo's mind like wasps. *Am I being too serious about a game?*\n\nStupid question.\n\nSatisfy generated cash. Real money. If he established a kingdom, the wealth would transcend imagination. Soccer players earned hundreds of billions of won annually. Basketball stars bought private islands. Both sports were less popular than Satisfy.\n\n*Satisfy players should be drowning in gold.*\n\n***\n\nThe original plan for the Second National Competition's opening promised spectacle.\n\nParis as the backdrop. Seven players from each country performing choreographed scenarios. Cutting-edge CGI. A world-famous rock band celebrating their thirtieth anniversary with a custom anthem.\n\nThe S.A. Group's marketing team had worked on it for months.\n\nAll cancelled.\n\nLim Cheolho sat at the head of a conference table surrounded by dozens of executives. The mood in the room felt like someone had died.\n\n\"The opening Grid proposed isn't bad,\" one executive ventured.\n\n\"Our marketing team's version had problems anyway.\" Another nodded. \"The order of appearance for each country was vague.\"\n\n\"Right. Should France open because we're in Paris? Or the United States because they ranked first?\"\n\n\"And where do we put Grid? He won three gold medals alone.\"\n\n\"Grid's proposal solves that.\" The executive pulled up the alternative opening on the projection screen. \"Instead of emphasizing nationality, it focuses on individual characteristics. Grid clearly serves as the Competition's symbol.\"\n\nMurmurs of agreement.\n\n\"But his intentions are impure.\" Someone slapped the table. \"Of two hundred twenty-four participants, forty-three belong to Overgeared. Those people get to do the opening with Grid. It's basically a guild promotional video.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" Another executive leaned back. \"Rumors already claim our group supports Korean rankers like Grid and Yura. This gives international media ammunition.\"\n\n\"The National Competition's purpose is to turn Satisfy into a sport. We want citizens immersed in the game, cheering for their countries. We should focus on nations, not individuals.\"\n\nThe debate raged for twenty minutes. Then Yoon Sangmin raised his hand.\n\n\"Grid has declared he won't participate unless he directs the opening.\"\n\nThe room went silent.\n\nGrid had dominated the First Competition. His exploits in Satisfy generated constant headlines. If Satisfy's biggest star refused to participate, viewership would crater.\n\n\"We can afford his absence.\" An executive crossed his arms. \"Whether Grid participates or not, average ratings will probably match last year.\"\n\n\"True.\" Yoon Sangmin stood. \"But we're not just talking about Grid.\"\n\nHe clicked to the next slide.\n\nKraugel's face filled the screen.\n\n\"The First ranked player. Kraugel's popularity exceeds Grid's. He has the title 'Sky Above the Sky.' His fans are fanatics.\" Yoon Sangmin circled the table. \"Unfortunately, he's never made a public appearance.\"\n\n\"What's your point?\"\n\n\"If Grid competes, Kraugel will also participate.\"\n\nConfused looks.\n\n\"Think about it. Everyone labeled 'the best' shares one trait.\" Yoon Sangmin tapped the screen. \"Massive pride. Kraugel wants to face Grid on the world stage. He wants the National Competition as their battlefield.\"\n\nUnderstanding dawned on several faces.\n\n\"If Kraugel participates...\" Yoon Sangmin smiled. \"The Second National Competition will overwhelm the first in every metric.\"\n\nNo one argued.\n\nThe decision was made.\n\n***\n\n『The Second National Competition begins in forty-three days! Kraugel, Grid, Zibal, and Chris confirmed to participate, alongside far more countries than the First Competition...』\n\n『Thirty-two countries total. Event details are public. Compared to the First National Competition...』\n\n『Today, with forty-two days remaining, the opening video released worldwide through Internet and broadcast channels!』\n\n『The opening video has sparked intense reactions. It's been well-received for expressing each player's unique characteristics. But it's also drawing criticism.』\n\n『Critics argue the title says 'National Competition,' yet the focus is on participants rather than countries. However...』\n\n『This brilliant four-minute, thirty-one-second video makes everyone's heart race.』\n\nThe rock band's performance opened with a wall of sound. Thirty years of perfecting their craft, distilled into pure adrenaline.\n\n*Syuong.*\n\nA red meteor tore across the dark blue sky.\n\n*Peeng!*\n\nThe camera shuddered with distant explosions.\n\n*Ssik.*\n\nA black-haired figure with pale white skin filled the frame. Grid in Blackening state, red lines tracing across his armor like veins of lava. The camera spiraled around him, revealing Overgeared members arrayed behind him like a war council.\n\nViewers erupted as Yura and Jishuka appeared behind Grid's shoulders. Both wore combat gear that somehow made them look more beautiful than any evening gown could manage.\n\nThe video cycled through players from various countries. Zibal and Chris got their moments. Before anyone registered the transition, the camera found someone staring up at the red comet.\n\nKraugel.\n\nHis beauty felt almost unreal. Perfect features that seemed carved rather than born.\n\nThe Sky Above the Sky.\n\nThe camera pulled back, revealing the contrast. Kraugel alone. Grid surrounded by forty-two allies.\n\nTheir eyes met across the distance.\n\n***\n\n> **Glossary of Common Korean Terms:**  \n> OG: Glossary Link  \n> Current schedule: 20 chapters a week  \n> \n> Check out my Patreon for early access to unedited chapters.
