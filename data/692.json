Their rarity spoke to their significance. When the system deemed an event worthy of such universal proclamation, it meant the course of history itself would shift.\n\nPrevious world messages had announced the invasion of the Eternal Kingdom by golems, the emergence of Pagma's Descendant, Kraugel's ascension as Sword Saint, and the appearance of Great Demon Belial. Each had marked a turning point. Now, as the latest message appeared, speculation ignited across the globe.\n\nTelevision panels assembled experts overnight.\n\n\"First, consider the designation itself—*hero*. The system doesn't bestow that title lightly. We're looking at a top-tier ranker, without question. Almost certainly someone with a hidden class.\"\n\n\"I'd go further. This has to be a legendary class holder. Only that would warrant the 'hero' classification.\"\n\nA third analyst leaned forward. \"Think about it contextually. Each Behen Archipelago island presents a unique trial, and the difficulty escalates dramatically. Based on testimony from the few who've reached the higher islands, we can infer that former legends themselves guard the later stages.\"\n\nThe discussion naturally turned to candidates: Kraugel, Grid, Agnus, Ares. But consensus formed quickly.\n\n\"Honestly? It has to be Kraugel. He defeated Grid even *before* claiming his legendary class. Now, as a Sword Saint—arguably the strongest legendary class in existence—he's operating on another level entirely.\"\n\n\"Agreed. The guardians of those final islands possess power comparable to, or exceeding, the great demons. I don't see anyone but Kraugel overcoming that.\"\n\n\"Though even for him, the final gate...\" Another expert shook his head. \"We're talking about a legend who surpasses the great demons. Muller himself, perhaps. That's not a fight anyone can win.\"\n\nThe speculation continued, experts filling airtime with educated guesses and carefully hedged predictions. Viewers ate it up.\n\nThen the second message arrived.\n\n**[The great hero, Overgeared King Grid, has given rest to the heroes and succeeded in cleansing the Behen Archipelago.]**\n\n**[This achievement will echo throughout humanity's history.]**\n\nSilence fell across the studio.\n\n\"...What?\"\n\n\"You have *got* to be fucking kidding me.\"\n\nThe curse slipped out before the analyst could stop himself. Not that it mattered—the damage was done. Once again, Grid had reduced their careful analysis to worthless speculation. The pattern was becoming humiliating. Whenever the Overgeared King entered the equation, conventional wisdom simply... evaporated.\n\nThe comment sections exploded:\n\n*—Called it! Next analyst, please.*\n\n*—These clowns get PAID for this? LMAO*\n\n*—Why do we even listen to them anymore?*\n\n*—I'm done trusting expert opinions. Grid breaks every rule.*\n\nAcross the globe, forums lit up with mockery and celebration in equal measure. The experts couldn't meet the camera's gaze.\n\nAll except one.\n\n\"KAHAHA! ALL HAIL GOD GRID! SOUTH KOREA REPRESENT!\"\n\nPeak Sword, invited as a professional player on a Korean network, pumped his fists in the air without a shred of shame.\n\n***\n\n\"Overgeared King... a legend of the new era.\" \n\nMadra's skeletal face somehow conveyed satisfaction. \"I am grateful. You've given me entertainment in my final moments. For that, you deserve a reward.\"\n\nGrid stood silent, processing the words. \n\nThis was the Undefeated King—a man who'd held that title unchallenged for centuries. To have it stripped away should have bred rage, resentment, the fury of wounded pride. Instead, Madra offered *thanks*.\n\nThen Grid understood.\n\n\"You were suffering.\"\n\nIt wasn't a question.\n\nThe former legends had completed their stories. They'd lived, fought, and earned their rest. Being torn from their graves, reanimated as hollow undead, forced to repeat an existence they'd already finished—\n\n\"Over a hundred years,\" Grid said quietly. \"Trapped on this desolate rock. Aware of what you'd become but powerless to change it. For someone with your intelligence, your self-awareness... I can't imagine the hell of it.\"\n\n\"You grasp it well.\" Madra's voice held warmth. \"Then you understand why I thank you.\"\n\n\"Rest now.\" Grid bowed deeply, the gesture flowing from genuine respect rather than obligation. \"You've more than earned it.\"\n\nMadra's form dissolved into grey ash that scattered on the wind, finally returning to the peace that death should have granted him centuries ago.\n\nThe moment he vanished, transformation rippled across the 66th island.\n\nThe oppressive atmosphere that had weighed on the air like a held breath suddenly released. Stagnant fog burned away under clean sunlight. Barren earth erupted with vegetation—lush grass, towering trees, wildflowers in impossible colors. A crystalline lake formed where moments before only cracked stone had existed.\n\nThen the ground *shook*.\n\n**KRUUUUUMBLE—**\n\nGrid staggered, catching himself as massive shapes rose from the earth surrounding the lake. Not pillars—*statues*. Nine enormous stone figures, each nearly ten meters tall, carved with such exquisite detail that Grid could make out individual strands of hair, the weave of clothing, the determined set of jaws.\n\n\"Wait... that's—Braham?!\"\n\nTwo of the statues bore faces Grid recognized instantly. One was Braham Eshwald in his prime, robed and dignified, staff in hand. The other—\n\n\"Pagma...\"\n\nUnderstanding crashed over him like a wave.\n\n\"The Hall of Fame. This is it. These are the former legends themselves.\"\n\n*—Indeed,* Braham confirmed, his voice resonating through Grid's consciousness. *—This place was built so future generations could honor our achievements. Witness those who came before you.*\n\nGrid's pulse quickened. He approached the statues slowly, reverently, his eyes moving from face to face.\n\nPagma stood tall and beautiful, just as Grid had seen through Randy's form. The sculptor—whoever they'd been—had captured not just his features but something in his bearing. Strength tempered by sorrow. A man who'd fought monsters but become one himself in the process.\n\n\"You created weapons to protect the world...\" Grid's voice was barely a whisper. \"But what you had to sacrifice to do it...\"\n\nHe knew Pagma's sins. The murder of Braham, his closest friend. The contract with Baal. The desecration of graves to create death knights. By any measure, Pagma was a complex figure at best, a villain at worst.\n\nBut Grid didn't care about judgment.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nHe bowed, the words carrying every ounce of sincerity in his heart. Without Pagma's techniques, Grid would still be the pathetic failure he'd been years ago. Whatever else Pagma had done, he'd left behind a path for others to follow—a path that had saved Grid's life in every way that mattered.\n\n*—This sculptor was an utter hack,* Braham complained. *—Look at this! They've completely failed to capture my magnificence!*\n\nGrid turned to Braham's statue, suppressing a smile. True, the carving didn't quite capture the vampire's otherworldly beauty. But something about the benign expression, the welcoming posture—it felt *wrong* for Braham.\n\n\"I understand the artist's dilemma,\" Grid offered diplomatically. \"Your beauty transcends mortal skill, Braham. Even a master sculptor would fall short.\"\n\nIt wasn't flattery. Braham's vampiric features genuinely approached perfection—many players considered him the ideal of beauty.\n\n*—Well...* Braham's irritation softened. *—I suppose that's inevitable.*\n\nThe statue showed Braham as history remembered him: a benevolent scholar who'd advanced magical theory for humanity's benefit. It glossed over the pride, the arrogance, the darker aspects. That revisionism stung in its own way—Mumud's contributions stolen, his own achievements built partially on betrayal.\n\nGrid moved to the third statue.\n\n\"Madra...\"\n\nThe Undefeated King stood carved in stone with a gentle smile, middle-aged and warm. Grid's throat tightened. The face matched his imagination perfectly.\n\nHis legs gave out. Grid sat heavily on the grass, staring up at the statue.\n\n\"Why is it always like this...?\"\n\nHe'd dreamed of meeting elves, of romantic encounters with beautiful females of that legendary race. Instead, the male elf had taken a liking to him. The pattern held—the people who showed him genuine affection were never the ones he'd fantasized about.\n\n\"Ha...\" Grid sighed, shaking his head. Then he continued his examination.\n\nSword Saint Muller looked like a manhwa protagonist brought to life—young, determined, burning with righteous ambition. Archer Povia possessed the delicate beauty of her half-elf heritage. Alex's face carried a deep melancholy, the expression of someone who'd endured profound suffering. Kruger and Gis both radiated craftsmanship, their weathered features speaking to countless hours of dedicated work.\n\nGrid's mood gradually lifted as he studied each legend in turn.\n\n\"I'm the first player to see all of them,\" he realized. \"The first to stand here, in this place...\"\n\nFor someone who'd spent years trailing behind others, being perpetually second-best or worse, this moment felt surreal. He was *ahead*. For once in his life, he'd reached a summit before anyone else.\n\nAs if in recognition of that achievement, the lake suddenly stirred.\n\n**KURURURURU—**\n\nWaves formed on its previously still surface, rippling outward in perfect circles.\n\n**SPLASH!**\n\nSomething rose from the center.\n\nA tenth statue.\n\nGrid's breath caught.\n\nThe figure stood smaller than the legends—a young man surrounded by four golden hands floating at cardinal points. He wore barbed armor that Grid recognized intimately, every plate and rivet familiar. In his right hand: a hammer. In his left: the Enlightenment Sword, wreathed in black flames.\n\nIt was *him*.\n\nA statue of Grid, erected in the Hall of Fame. Not at the periphery, not hidden in a corner, but rising from the lake's center—positioned so that all nine former legends faced him.\n\n\"Holy shit...\"\n\nThe implications crashed over him. Being registered in the Hall of Fame didn't just mean a name on some list. It meant *this*—a permanent monument to his achievements, standing alongside history itself.\n\nNotification windows bloomed before his eyes:\n\n**[The Behen Archipelago has been successfully purified.]**\n\n**[You have accomplished what none could achieve for over a century: cleansing the archipelago after the great demon invasion and granting rest to the imprisoned legends. This deed will be recorded in perpetuity.]**\n\n**[Your statue has been erected in the Behen Archipelago's Hall of Fame. Statue-exclusive buffs have been created.]**\n\n**[Reward: 5 Levels]**\n\n**[Reward: Challenger Points filled to maximum (1,000,000)]**\n\n**[The Fog Island Store is now accessible.]**\n\n**[Death Knight Madra, Guardian of the 66th Island, has added a special item to the Fog Island Store as thanks for granting him peace.]**\n\n\"Fog Island?!\"\n\nGrid's heart hammered against his ribs. He'd completely forgotten—the legendary store that only opened after cleansing the archipelago!\n\n\"If elixirs cost 250 points each, and I have a million...\" His mind raced. \"That's four *thousand* elixirs! And there's a special item from Madra?!\"\n\nThe rewards he'd collected from the 60s islands had been incredible. But this? This was beyond anything he'd imagined.\n\n\"YES! FINALLY!\" Grid pumped his fist, laughing. \"YAHOO!\"\n\nAll the pain, the grinding difficulty, the frustration—worth it. All of it worth it.\n\nFog materialized around him, coalescing into a golden carriage that gleamed in the sunlight. Grid didn't hesitate. He sprinted toward it, already planning his purchases.\n\n\"With stats this high, maybe I should change my title to 'Stats King'! Hahaha!\"\n\nHe was talking to himself like a madman. He didn't care. This moment belonged to him.\n\nThe carriage door opened. Grid climbed inside, and the interface appeared:\n\n**—Fog Island Items—**\n\n**[Madra's Diary]**  \n*A diary written by Death Knight Madra during his imprisonment.*  \n**Price:** 1,000,000 Challenger Points\n\n**[East Continent Movement Scroll]**  \n*Transports the user to Pangea, the starting village of the East Continent.*  \n**Weight:** 0.1  \n**Price:** 50 Challenger Points\n\nGrid stared.\n\nBlinked.\n\nStared again.\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nA diary? The special item was a *diary*? And it cost *all* his points?\n\n\"Where are the elixirs?!\" His voice cracked. \"The store only has TWO things?!\"\n\nThe golden carriage seemed to mock him with its opulence.\n\n\"FUCK!\"\n\nThe curse echoed through the Hall of Fame, profaning the sacred space built to honor legends. Birds scattered from nearby trees.\n\nIn that moment, Grid remembered something he'd forgotten in his excitement: this quest hadn't come from the system. It had come from *Sticks*.\n\nThat old elf bastard had sent him here.\n\nWhich meant this wasn't the only reward. The *real* reward was still waiting back in the world.\n\nGrid's eye twitched. He looked at the diary. Looked at the scroll. Looked at his point total.\n\nThen he started laughing—a slightly unhinged sound that suggested he was either about to cry or commit violence.\n\n\"Of course,\" he muttered. \"Of *course* it's like this.\""
