  "content": "**Tower of Eternity, 32nd Floor**\n\nGoldhit stared into the crystal ball, watching Grid's steady ascent through the tower. Her fingers drummed against the scrying surface as she wrestled with the decision she knew she'd have to make.\n\n*I have no choice.*\n\nShe reached for the activation mechanism.\n\nThe Lightning God had taken fifteen years to perfect—from the discovery of the massive thunder stone in Titan's northwestern forest to the final integration of her knowledge, magic, and the Empire's considerable resources. Like the other guardians stationed throughout the tower, it possessed innate resistance to physical attacks. Unlike them, it combined a magician's magical firepower with the raw combat prowess of a solo number knight.\n\nIts operational range was limited to the Tower of Eternity itself, but that hardly mattered. If the mass production project succeeded, the Lightning God would become the Empire's greatest weapon in the eastward expansion. Emperor Juander himself had staked considerable hopes on it.\n\nGoldhit opened the containment chamber. The thunder stone's power flooded the system, awakening the guardian.\n\n\"Never kill him,\" she commanded. \"Subdue, but do not kill.\"\n\n---\n\nThe 32nd floor held no guardian, just as the 21st had not. Instead, endless shelves groaned under the weight of countless tomes, and magicians sat scattered throughout the vast space, lost in study.\n\nGrid paused, looking around at the impossible architecture. *How does the space even work?*\n\nEvery floor of the Tower of Eternity seemed to exist in its own dimension. Some, like this one, stretched beyond measure. Others measured less than three hundred square meters. The building's exterior gave no hint of the impossible geography within—each floor felt like exploring an entirely different world.\n\n\"Overgeared King, I'll guide you.\"\n\nA magician approached before Grid could locate the stairs to the next level. Moments later, Grid stood on the threshold of the 33rd floor.\n\n*From here, things get serious.*\n\nStarting from the 33rd floor, the rewards increased—three intelligence points per floor instead of two. If he maintained this pace and reached the 80th floor, learning Fireball would be within reach.\n\nGrid pushed open the door, already calculating the possibilities.\n\nA humanoid figure stood waiting—unlike any guardian he'd encountered before. Gold plating covered its entire frame. Red eyes burned beneath a pointed chin, three horns jutting from its skull like a crown of threat. Most striking was the electrical current that danced across its metallic body, pale blue lightning flickering as it burned dust from the air.\n\n*Step.*\n\nThe Lightning God moved. Minor explosions rippled with each footfall.\n\n*Step.*\n\nOne stride. Two. The distance between them vanished. A golden hand closed around Grid's skull and *slammed* him into the floor.\n\n**CRASH!**\n\n\"Kuk...!\"\n\nFaster than the Lilith Guardian! Grid hadn't even seen the attack coming. Pain exploded through his body.\n\n**[You have received 4,230 damage.]**\n\nMore than half of it was lightning-based.\n\n\"God Hands!\"\n\nFor the first time since entering the tower, Grid called for help. Four golden constructs materialized, Mjolnirs at the ready. They swung—and recoiled as one of the Lightning God's horns flared blue. An electrical barrier enveloped the guardian's body, blocking the physical assault while simultaneously shocking the God Hands into paralysis.\n\n**SLAM!**\n\nGrid's face hit the floor again. He twisted, blade sweeping behind him in a backhanded cut. Black flames erupted from the edge, engulfing the Lightning God's arm. But like the other guardians, it ignored the physical component of the fire—no damage registered.\n\nGrid struck again and again until finally, the flames activated properly. He wrenched himself free and launched his counterattack.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship, Link!\"\n\nHis enhanced attack speed let him trigger the flames repeatedly.\n\n**[You have dealt 4,100 damage to the target!]**\n**[You have dealt 4,100 damage to the target!]**\n**[You have dealt 4,100...]**\n\n*Nothing's perfect,* Grid thought as he watched the damage accumulate. The Lightning God surpassed the Lilith Guardian in speed, destructive power, and magical ability—but its fire resistance was only average.\n\nStill, *that health pool is massive.*\n\nEven after ten flame emissions, the Lightning God's health gauge had barely budged. The problem wasn't resistance—it was the limited base damage of the fire itself.\n\nThe Lightning God spread its stance and roared.\n\nGrid's eyes widened. He'd seen this before—in Reinhardt, during the golem invasion. The guardian's mouth, previously clamped shut, gaped open. Golden light gathered within, magic power condensing into a deadly sphere.\n\nA breath attack. Grid recognized the buildup and shifted into a sword dance stance. The Lightning God unleashed the blast—a straight-line projectile screaming toward him.\n\n---\n\n**Tower Monitoring Chamber**\n\nGoldhit leaned forward, watching through the crystal ball. Her pulse quickened.\n\n*Now. Now he'll use magic.*\n\nGrid's skills exceeded the rumors, true, but they weren't enough against the Lightning God. The guardian combined a magician's magical power with a solo number knight's physical might—its destructive potential was overwhelming.\n\n\"Don't delay any longer—show me the enhanced magic!\" she shouted at the image.\n\nBut in her excitement, Goldhit had overlooked something crucial. While the Lightning God indeed possessed the combined power of magician and knight, it lacked a great magician's versatile spellcasting ability.\n\n---\n\n**33rd Floor**\n\n\"Revolve.\"\n\nGrid's sword moved in a perfect arc. The technique caught the golden blast and *spun* it back at the Lightning God. The guardian had no counter for a maneuver that exceeded its programmed parameters.\n\nThe energy sphere struck home.\n\n\"Noe!\"\n\n\"Nyaaaaong! Finally, this body's turn!\"\n\nAs Grid's opponents grew stronger, Noe's opportunities to contribute had dwindled. Recent enemies hadn't even let him get close, rendering Soul Ingestion useless.\n\n\"Nyahahat! Witness the greatness of Hell's best demonic beast!\"\n\nBut the Lightning God was different. According to its programming, a 'cat' registered as non-threatening. Even as Grid's counterattack ravaged its systems, the guardian ignored the small creature approaching. All processing power focused on Grid.\n\nA fatal error.\n\nNoe's mouth opened *wide*—impossibly wide—and swallowed the Lightning God whole. Soul Ingestion activated.\n\n**[The Memphis Noe has consumed half the power of the magic weapon 'Lightning God.']**\n**[Your Intelligence will increase by 3,113 for 3 seconds!]**\n**[You have comprehended the knowledge and magic of Braham.]**\n**[The skill Fireball (Enhanced) can now be used.]**\n**[The skill Dark Cutter (Enhanced) can now be used.]**\n**[The skill Chain Lightning (Enhanced) can now be used.]**\n**[The skill Enchant Weapon (Enhanced) can now be used.]**\n**[The skill Decoy (Enhanced) can now be used.]**\n**[The skill Ice Spear (Enhanced) can now be used.]**\n**[The skill Mana Jamming (Enhanced) can now be used.]**\n\nGrid staggered as Braham's knowledge flooded his mind. The legendary magician had been selective—flooding Grid with every spell would have caused chaos rather than advantage. Instead, Braham had left only what Grid *needed*, magic he could properly wield. Now, with his intelligence temporarily skyrocketing, Grid could finally grasp them.\n\n\"Decoy.\"\n\nA bird-shaped construct materialized—pure mana given form.\n\n*Flap.*\n\nWings beat. The bird soared toward the ceiling. The Lightning God, freshly ejected from Noe's mouth, tracked the movement with its eyes. The guardian didn't understand why it felt weaker, didn't recognize that the cat it had dismissed had crippled it. It simply followed the programmed response: pursue the target.\n\nOnly for a moment.\n\n\"Mana Jamming.\"\n\nEvery strand of mana in the chamber went haywire—except Grid's. The ambient mana in the air scattered. The Lightning God's internal mana reversed flow and *seized*. The guardian plummeted toward the floor.\n\n\"Ice Spear.\"\n\nA two-meter lance of ice materialized beside Grid, beautiful and terrible in its crystalline perfection.\n\n**[Ice Spear (Enhanced) Lv. 1]**\n**Deals 10,000 fixed damage plus additional damage proportional to Intelligence. Ignores target's magic resistance.**\n**Hit targets are inflicted with 'Frozen' status. Frozen targets receive double damage from subsequent Ice Spears.**\n**Mana Cost: 2,500**\n**Cooldown: 1 minute**\n\nThe target was obvious.\n\n**CRASH!**\n\nThe Lightning God slammed into the ground.\n\n*Thunk!*\n\n**[You have dealt 23,900 damage to the target!]**\n\nThe giant ice spear punched through its back. The guardian's limbs locked up as the pierced area flash-froze. It tried to move, servos whining—\n\nMore ice spears appeared. One after another. Grid had queued Alarm + Ice Spear from the moment he cast Decoy.\n\n*Thunk! Shatter! Thunk! Shatter!*\n\nPierced. Frozen. Broken. Pierced. Frozen. Broken. The Lightning God's health plummeted with mechanical inevitability.\n\n---\n\n**Tower Monitoring Chamber**\n\nGoldhit's face had gone white. Nine years of development. Nine years of refinement. The Lightning God—the Empire's future—was being systematically dismantled before her eyes.\n\nBut there was a worse problem.\n\n\"I-I can't understand...\"\n\nShe'd watched every movement, analyzed every spell construct. And she understood *nothing*. The enhanced magic she'd hoped to reverse-engineer remained completely opaque.\n\nThe truth crystallized in her mind with crushing finality: she couldn't receive the enhanced magic because Braham was *transcendent*, not because she herself was ignorant. The gap wasn't one of study or effort—it was fundamental.\n\nWhich led to another realization. If only a genius could inherit Braham's magic, then Grid—\n\n\"Grid...! You are a perfect existence...!!\"\n\nThe continent's greatest magician had just admitted defeat. Respect and envy warred in her heart as she watched Grid's impossible precision.\n\nAnd—\n\n\"Haaaack! Too delicious nyong!\"\n\nNoe devoured the Lightning God's remains with obvious relish.\n\n---\n\n**Imperial Palace—Same Moment**\n\n\"Kuk...! Kuaaah...!\"\n\nFirst Knight Mercedes had been pleading for reinstatement when the scream cut through the throne room.\n\n\"Kuaaaaack!\"\n\nGyuratan—Fourth Knight—collapsed, thrashing. On the tower's highest floor, the thunder stone that powered the Lightning God *shattered*, and the backlash tore through the connection.\n\n\"Your Majesty!\"\n\nMercedes knew. She'd always known what Gyuratan truly was. Color drained from her face as she moved—faster than anyone else present—throwing herself in front of Emperor Juander despite her suspension, despite being forbidden from bearing arms or armor.\n\n\"Kuhuk...! Huhuhu!\"\n\nGyuratan stopped trying to hide. Demonic energy poured from him in waves.\n\nBoth Mercedes and Gyuratan stood frozen in mutual shock. Neither had expected the situation to spiral out of control so rapidly."
