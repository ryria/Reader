  "content": "Grid reached into his inventory. Two weapons materialized in the air before him.\n\nThe first was a hammer so massive it required both hands to lift. The second was something far stranger.\n\n> **[Dragon Hammer]**\n> \n> Rating: <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Unique</span>\n> \n> Durability: 400/400 | Attack Power: 250\n> \n> *A hammer made by the legendary blacksmith Grid.*\n> \n> *Designed specifically to strike Dragon Harpoon Pillars into the earth. Exceptional size and weight make it effective as a weapon, though few can wield it properly.*\n> \n> **User Restriction:** Strength 3,000+\n> \n> Weight: 5,500\n\nThe Dragon Harpoon consisted of two components. A trident-tipped spear connected by rope to an enormous steel pillar. The design was simple in concept: anchor the pillar, then hurl the harpoon to chain a dragon to the ground.\n\n> **[Dragon Harpoon]**\n> \n> Rating: <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Unique</span>\n> \n> Durability: 500/500 | Attack Power: 620\n> \n> * 100% hit rate when restraint effect activates\n> * Restraint persists while pillar remains embedded\n> * Pillar rises incrementally with each resistance attempt\n> \n> *A secondary weapon crafted by the legendary blacksmith Grid.*\n> \n> *The harpoon itself is forged from jaffa for optimal throwing weight. The pillar contains massive quantities of steel for ground penetration. Installation time is considerable. Total weight makes popularity impossible.*\n> \n> *However, the effect is absolute.*\n> \n> **User Restriction:** Strength 4,000+ | Dexterity 2,000+ | Javelin-type skill required\n> \n> Weight: 30,000\n\n*Who the hell can use this?* \n\nThe stat requirements alone were absurd. **4,000 Strength** was a threshold most damage dealers could only fantasize about. **2,000 Dexterity** was borderline impossible without a production-oriented class. Add in the javelin skill requirement, and the pool of potential users shrank to exactly one person.\n\nGrid.\n\n*No material value whatsoever.* Listing it on the auction house would be a waste of fees.\n\nBut the performance was undeniable. Attack power and options far exceeded standard secondary weapons. Durability high enough to survive extended combat. The only limitation was inherent to the weapon type itself.\n\nPersistence was weak.\n\n> [The target 'drake' is struggling with the Dragon Harpoon!]\n> \n> [The pillar of the Dragon Harpoon is pulled out slightly! (4/5)]\n\n> [The target 'drake' is struggling with the Dragon Harpoon!]\n> \n> [The pillar of the Dragon Harpoon is pulled out slightly! (3/5)]\n\nFive resistance attempts. That was the limit. Physics didn't apply here. Regardless of the target's mass or strength, the restraint would fail after exactly five struggles.\n\n*Kurarararara!*\n\nThe drake thrashed against its bonds. Each violent spasm pulled the rope taut, dragging the pillar upward through compacted earth. The ground trembled. Soil erupted in waves.\n\n『The South Korean team's drake is entering a berserk state!』\n\n『The pillar won't hold much longer. Freedom is imminent.』\n\nUrgency crept into the commentators' voices. They were already imagining the carnage. Korean representatives crushed beneath claws and incinerated by dragonfire.\n\nGrid raised the Dragon Hammer. He swung.\n\n*Kwang!*\n\n> [The target 'drake' is struggling with the Dragon Harpoon!]\n> \n> [The pillar of the Dragon Harpoon is pulled out slightly! (1/5)]\n> \n> [The Dragon Hammer has struck the pillar!]\n> \n> [The Dragon Harpoon's pillar has been driven deeper! (2/5)]\n> \n> [Dragon Harpoon durability decreased by 57!]\n\nThe pillar had nearly freed itself. Grid hammered it back down. Then he did it again.\n\n*Kyaooooh!*\n\n*Kaaang! Kaaang!*\n\nThe drake screamed. Grid struck. The rope connecting harpoon to pillar stretched and slackened in rhythm with the beast's struggles. Durability plummeted with each hammer blow.\n\nGrid's voice cut through the chaos. \"What are you doing? Attack it while it can't fly!\"\n\nThe Korean representatives stood motionless. The drake's roars had temporarily deafened them. They couldn't hear Grid's words.\n\nBut they weren't idiots. They knew what needed to happen.\n\nPeak Sword drew his blade. \"Draw Sword, Sudden.\"\n\nYura's gun blazed. \"Regulus.\"\n\n\"Flame that won't turn off!\"\n\n\"Shield Boomerang!\"\n\n*Pepepepeok!*\n\nSkills hammered into the drake's hide. Yura had been firing since the beginning. However...\n\n> [You have dealt 250,040 damage to the target.]\n\n> [The target has avoided it.]\n\n> [The target has resisted.]\n\n> [The skill cannot penetrate the target's scales.]\n\nOnly Peak Sword's attacks registered meaningful damage. Was it the drake's defense and resistance? That was secondary. The real problem was level disparity.\n\nGrid was **Level 306**. Peak Sword was **Level 309**. The rest of the Korean team languished in the 200s. In severe cases, a **200 level gap** separated attacker from target.\n\nAt that differential, damage application became theoretical. Like throwing eggs at a cliff face. Worse than that, actually.\n\n*I'm not helping at all.*\n\nYura's finger never left the trigger. Her beautiful face twisted as MISS notifications flooded her vision. She had dominated the rankings for years. This helplessness was foreign. Unbearable.\n\n*Kwaaaaah!*\n\nThe drake's breath weapon ignited the air. One exhalation could transform the arena into a crematorium.\n\n\"Aaaagh!\"\n\nScreams erupted. Peak Sword and Yura weathered the flames. The other representatives collapsed, burning and disoriented.\n\nGrid checked his health bar. While his teammates spiraled into stress and despair, a smile crept across his face.\n\n\"Maybe I should do this alone? If so, all the drops belong to me, okay?\"\n\n\"...Eh?\"\n\nHe planned to solo that monstrosity? The Korean representatives stared at him. Their hearing had just recovered in time to catch that absurd declaration.\n\n*Kuuong!*\n\nThe Dragon Harpoon shattered. The drake ripped free.\n\nGrid dismissed the broken weapon. He watched the monster ascend into the sky.\n\n\"You're much weaker than Elfin Stone.\"\n\nVampire Earl Elfin Stone had been a named boss. Overwhelming stats and skills. The combined might of Overgeared's elite had barely sufficed. Multiple brushes with annihilation.\n\nThis drake? Unnamed. High level, certainly, but lacking the complexity of a true boss. The developers had calculated the difficulty for seven players working in coordination. The gap between this and Elfin Stone was substantial.\n\nThe only advantage the drake possessed was flight.\n\nGrid equipped Braham's Boots. \"I can move in the sky.\"\n\nHe launched himself upward. The weapon in his hand wasn't Iyarugt. It wasn't Failure. It wasn't Grid's Greatsword.\n\n> **[Efficient Hunting Sword]**\n> \n> Rating: <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Unique</span>\n> \n> Durability: 410/410 | Attack Power: 720\n> \n> * +30% damage vs monsters\n> * +50% critical rate vs monsters\n> * +20% item drop rate on kill\n> \n> *A longsword crafted by the legendary blacksmith Grid.*\n> \n> *Combines the preferred attributes of professional monster hunters into a single weapon.*\n> \n> **User Restriction:** Level 300+ | Advanced Sword Mastery Lv. 3 | Strength 2,000+ | Agility 1,000+\n\n*That's right!*\n\nGrid had finally created a dedicated monster-hunting weapon. Two years of collecting production methods as Pagma's Descendant had led to this. He'd only enhanced it to **+7** due to stone scarcity. But even in this state, it outperformed **+9 Iyarugt**, **+9 Failure**, and **+8 Grid's Greatsword** for PvE.\n\n*Above all, there's the item drop bonus.*\n\nA weapon optimized for hunting. Like Debirion's arsenal. Grid gripped the crescent-shaped blade. He unleashed his swordsmanship.\n\n*Kurarararak!*\n\nThe drake wanted to kill this filthy human.\n\n*Kuoooooh!*\n\nIt dove. The atmosphere compressed beneath its mass as it accelerated toward Grid.\n\nGrid held his stance. He didn't flinch.\n\n\"Linked Kill!\"\n\n*Puok!*\n\nHe drove the blade into the approaching target.\n\n*Puoook!*\n\nTwo hits.\n\n*Puk! Puk! Puk.*\n\nThree hits, four hits, five consecutive strikes.\n\n*Peeok!*\n\nThe drake's claw slammed into Grid's chest. Triple Layers absorbed the impact. Pain flooded his nervous system. He gritted his teeth and chained another technique.\n\n\"Link.\"\n\n> [Critical!]\n> \n> [Critical!]\n> \n> [Critical!]\n> \n> [Critical!]\n\nA man. A monster larger than a building. How many viewers saw him as a candle flame in a hurricane?\n\n*Kieeeeeeek!*\n\nThe monster fell.\n\n***\n\n『This is impossible!』\n\nThe raid commentators fell silent.\n\nWere they marveling at the US team's systematic recovery from disarray, their coordinated assault on the drake?\n\nNo.\n\nWere they admiring the Japanese team's stability, built on Damian's buffs and their tank's endurance?\n\nNo.\n\nWere they praising Kraugel's control, the way he manipulated aggro with surgical precision?\n\nAlso no.\n\nEvery nation's representatives performed admirably. Different strategies, different approaches, all effective. But none of it left a lasting impression.\n\nOnly one person. Only Korea's Grid could induce this sensation in the commentators. Grid faced the drake alone. He played tanker and damage dealer simultaneously. Control? Strategy? He simply obliterated the drake with overwhelming attack power.\n\nAnd he did it solo.\n\nPeak Sword pumped his fist in the air. \"God Grid fighting!\"\n\nThe **15th ranked** player had been reduced to a cheerleader."
