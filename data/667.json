  "content": "\"An item with universal applications...\" Grid muttered, running his fingers along the Sword Ghost's blade. \"Every myth-rated weapon specializes. Even Lifael's Spear and the Red Phoenix Bow focus on single attributes. The materials limit what's possible.\"\n\nHe paused mid-thought. Did the weapon need to be all-encompassing? Or did it just need *versatility*?\n\nHis pulse quickened. Item Transformation. Item Combination. And the Sword Ghost itself—separable, reconfigurable.\n\n\"What if I made something that transforms without burning a skill slot?\" He examined the weapon more closely, turning it over. \"Like this detachable mechanism, but... modular.\"\n\nThe +7 Sword Ghost gleamed in his hands. Grid pulled up its information window.\n\n[+7 Sword Ghost]\nRating: Legendary\n...\n* Can be separated into small and large pieces.\n* When separated, the attack power of the small and large piece are applied separately.\n...\nTwo knobs fashioned from drake fangs—one mid-blade, one at the base. Turn the center knob and the weapon splits cleanly. The entire surface was black, knobs and blade indistinguishable to the untrained eye, making the separation mechanism nearly invisible in combat.\n\n\"Multiple Sword Ghosts,\" Grid whispered. \"Different attributes. Interchangeable blades for different situations.\"\n\nPerfect. Almost.\n\nHe summoned the weapon and tested the mechanism. Separation—half a second. Reattachment—point seven. Retrieving a new blade from inventory—another half second.\n\n\"Two seconds total.\" His jaw tightened. Against trash mobs, two seconds meant nothing. Against anything that mattered? \"Lethal.\"\n\nThe God Hands couldn't provide absolute coverage. Tiramet's summon was unavailable. The Overgeared Skeletons could block twice before shattering. None of his defenses could cover a two-second vulnerability gap against transcendent opponents.\n\nHis frown deepened—then vanished.\n\n\"The silver thread.\"\n\nHe pulled up the material's description, scanning past the combat applications he'd been fixated on for weeks.\n\n[Silver Thread]\nAttack Power: 100~????\nDurability: 1,000/1,000\n\nFragments of silver armor shaped within armored needle blood vessels for years. Pure silver, not merely silver-plated. Infused with the creature's potent magic.\n\nForm varies with user skill, allowing diverse applications.\n\n* Classified as secondary weapon.\nConditions of Use: Secondary Weapons Mastery Advanced Level 5. 2,000+ Dexterity.\n* 2,000+ Dexterity: Rapid deployment\n* 2,500+ Dexterity: Twist 5 strands into desired shapes\n* 3,000+ Dexterity: Twist 10 strands into desired shapes\n* 4,000+ Dexterity: Control speed doubled\n* 5,000+ Dexterity: Twist 20 strands...\n...\n* Can be used as crafting material. Requires craftsman-level blacksmithing.\nWeight: 5\n\nHe'd wasted months trying to master it as a weapon. Even with his dexterity, controlling thread while wielding a sword and casting magic was impossible against serious threats. The fight with Agnus had proven that much.\n\n\"Every East Continent blacksmith dreams of obtaining this material.\" Grid shook his head at his own stubbornness. \"And I've been treating it like a whip.\"\n\nThe thread's true value wasn't as a weapon. It was as a *mechanism*.\n\n\"Connection!\" The realization hit him like lightning. \"Nyang?\"\n\nNoe's eyes went wide at the sudden shout.\n\nGrid scooped up the demonic cat, scratching behind his ears. \"The silver thread connects the blade segments. One button press—the thread contracts, the spare blade flies in and locks onto the handle automatically!\"\n\n\"...Nyang?\" Noe's expression suggested profound confusion.\n\n\"Like a grappling hook. Or—\" Grid's grin widened. \"Like a spider's web, pulling prey to the center. I'll make the attachment system.\"\n\nHe didn't hesitate. Decisiveness was one of his few natural advantages.\n\n\"Legendary Blacksmith's Creation!\"\n\n[Legendary Blacksmith's Creation]\n\nCreate three equipment production methods per skill level increase of Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship.\n\nCurrent available: 10/24\n\n* Creator's name automatically placed on items produced with this skill.\n\n[What item do you want to create?]\n\n\"A secondary tool. Button-activated. Reels silver thread in or out on command.\"\n\n[...Analyzing your intentions. Understood. Analyzing silver thread item information.]\n\nSilence.\n\nGrid waited. One minute. Two. Five.\n\n\"Can't it handle the request?\" Maybe he'd been too vague. Or too specific. He opened his mouth to rephrase—\n\n[Silver thread analysis complete. Creation parameters understood. Confirm creation?]\n\nGrid's shoulders relaxed. The supercomputer's processing power never failed to impress.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n[Select materials.]\n\n\"Drake fang. I'm attaching it to the Sword Ghost's handle—should match the existing material.\"\n\nHe checked his inventory. Just enough drake fang remained. A blank blueprint materialized before him.\n\n[Please design the item.]\n\nThe Legendary Blacksmith's Creation skill filled knowledge gaps automatically. Grid trusted the system to handle what he couldn't and began sketching.\n\nA compact box that wouldn't interfere with his grip. Inside, a rotating mechanism—clockwise to reel in, counterclockwise to release. External buttons for each direction.\n\n'Keep it simple. Functional over elegant.'\n\nTwo hours of careful revision. His draftsmanship was crude—he was no artist—but the concept was solid. A five-centimeter cube of drake fang. Two buttons. Internal fan system rotating based on which button was pressed, pulling or feeding out silver thread accordingly.\n\n\"Multiple boxes mounted on the Sword Ghost's handle,\" Grid explained to the empty air. \"Each one connected to a different blade via silver thread. The blades stay in inventory until I need them. Button press, thread contracts, blade flies out and locks into place.\"\n\n[...]\n\nThe system went quiet again.\n\n\"Too ambitious?\" Grid grimaced. He should've researched mechanical engineering principles first, found reference designs online—\n\n[Design confirmed? Completing the blueprint will consume one creation skill charge.]\n\n\"Oh!\" Relief flooded through him. Morpheus truly was remarkable.\n\n\"Confirmed!\"\n\n*Suksak suksak.*\n\nEquations and diagrams swarmed across his blueprint. The system calculated force vectors, thread tension, rotation speeds in real-time. Grid's rough sketch transformed into something functional, the internal mechanisms rendered with precision he could never have achieved alone.\n\nSeveral minutes passed.\n\n[Describe the item's characteristics.]\n\nThe revised blueprint displayed the same external box, but the interior had been completely re-engineered to viable specifications.\n\n'Mana-powered rotation.' Grid noted the energy cost. A small price for the convenience. \"It's an attachment system. One button deploys a blade from inventory via silver thread. The thread stays connected but retracted when not in use. Press the button, the blade shoots out and mounts to the handle. Quick-swap system for—\"\n\n[Impossible under current parameters. Silver thread cannot link to items stored separately in inventory. Connected items must occupy the same physical space.]\n\nGrid's explanation died in his throat.\n\n[Recommendation: Create dedicated external storage for thread-connected blades.]\n\n\"...\"\n\nA vision flashed through his mind—himself on the battlefield, handle in one scarred hand, ten massive blades arrayed around his body like a halo of steel.\n\nThe Overgeared King, bristling with weapons.\n\n\"That works too.\""
