  "content": "Grid's fists clenched at his sides. \"I'll challenge the best. Kraugel.\"\n\nThe anticipation alone was enough. Win or lose, this moment mattered.\n\nAcross from him, Kraugel's jaw tightened. *I'm sorry.* The thought was bitter. Grid didn't know about the deal with Lauel, the quiet agreement struck before any of this began. *I don't deserve to answer your pure heart.*\n\nHis knuckles went white. Satisfy had stopped being a game months ago. It wasn't entertainment anymore. It was a tool, a means to an end. Every player climbing the rankings toward him carried that same fire Grid showed now, that same hunger. He felt like a fraud standing here. But guilt wouldn't fix anything.\n\n\"I'll only fight to win,\" Kraugel said quietly.\n\nHe swallowed the words that wanted to follow and climbed onto the stage. Each step was for his mother. For the hospital bills. For the surgery that might never come. The crowd saw only confidence, the unshakable number one.\n\nBut in a hospital room on the outskirts of Moscow, a woman watched her son's face on a small television. Tears ran down her cheeks.\n\n***\n\n> [The lots will be drawn according to country ranking.]\n\nGrid approached the glass barrel first. Sixty-four players waited behind him. He reached inside without hesitation, grabbing a colored ball at random. *Let this be it. Let me finally shake off the bad luck.* The host checked the number and raised his voice.\n\n> [Number 32! Grid has been assigned to Group 32!]\n\n> [Next up is Skull of the United States.]\n\n> [Skull draws number 12.]\n\nThe line moved forward. When Kraugel stepped up, every camera in the venue swung toward him.\n\n> [Number 1! Kraugel is number 1!]\n\nThe commentators leaned into their microphones. \"This is dramatic. The two favorites won't meet until the finals.\"\n\n\"If they both make it, the audience ratings will be historic.\"\n\n\"Half the world might stop moving to watch.\"\n\n\"Waaaaahhhhh!\"\n\nThe crowd roared. International broadcasters calculated advertising rates with barely concealed glee. The perfect matchup was within reach.\n\nGrid exhaled. *Yes!* His shoulders relaxed for the first time in hours. Kraugel was on the opposite side of the bracket. He wouldn't have to face the monster until the very end. Maybe his luck was finally turning.\n\n> [Hao of China has been assigned to Group 32 with Grid.]\n\nGrid's smile died.\n\n> [It'll be a fierce battle from the first round.]\n\n> [Chris, 3rd on the unified rankings, and Soul Predator Seuron will compete in Group 31.]\n\n> [The winner will face the winner of Group 32.]\n\n> [Four winning candidates on one side of the bracket. It's a complete group of death.]\n\n> [Damian has drawn number 29.]\n\nGrid stared at the completed tournament table. His mouth hung open. Hao. Chris. Seuron. Pon. Regas. Damian. Katz. Every major threat had clustered around his side of the draw like metal shavings to a magnet. Every single match would be a war.\n\n\"This is too mentally exhausting.\" His voice came out flat.\n\n*It's impossible. I can't shake it off.*\n\nHis hands trembled. The bad luck wasn't going anywhere.\n\n\"Well,\" he muttered. \"Good for building experience.\"\n\n***\n\n*This is an opportunity.*\n\nHao, China's Miracle, studied Grid from across the venue. Only Kraugel was stronger. Everyone else was beneath him. *I'll break him.* Grid would be the proof. Kraugel would see the display of power and finally acknowledge Hao's strength.\n\n*Kraugel, I'll make you look at me.*\n\nHe'd been chasing Kraugel's shadow since the beginning. Recognition was everything. Grid made the perfect stepping stone.\n\n*I'll completely smash him.*\n\nFrom the stands, Lauel watched Hao's focused expression. His smile was dark.\n\n***\n\n\"Grid won't make the finals.\"\n\n\"Being matched with Hao in the first round...\"\n\n\"Drawing number 32 and fighting four consecutive winning candidates. It's ridiculous.\"\n\n\"One mistake and he's eliminated.\"\n\n\"What is this bracket?\"\n\nKorean fans stared at screens with hollow expressions. The dream of South Korea reaching number one was crumbling before it had even started.\n\n\"Isn't this rigged?\"\n\n\"It's 100% manipulated. Why else would Grid's path be this brutal?\"\n\n\"Look at Kraugel's side. His luck is absurd. The only threat there is Skull.\"\n\n\"Russia must've paid the organizers.\"\n\nThey couldn't imagine the truth. This wasn't manipulation. This was just Grid's life.\n\n***\n\n*This worked out well.*\n\nTarma had assassinated the 2nd ranked user before. People ignored him after his loss to Grid, but that suited him fine. Better, even. It meant his real target, Kraugel, wouldn't be watching.\n\n*A 10 billion won bounty.*\n\nHe checked the tournament bracket. First match of the round of 64. Kraugel versus Tarma.\n\n\"Kuk...! Kukukuk! Good. This is very good!\"\n\nBlood Carnival's top five assassin would show the world what he could do. Killing intent rolled off him in waves as he climbed onto the stage.\n\nKraugel was already waiting in the center, black hair shifting in the wind. His eyes looked different. Deeper. Duller. Something in his atmosphere had changed.\n\nTarma didn't care. Atmosphere meant nothing.\n\n\"The sky above the sky! The sky above the sky! The sky above the sky!\"\n\nThe crowd's chant was deafening. The world believed in Kraugel's victory without question. But Tarma stood unmoved. The crowd noise didn't even register inside Satisfy's combat system, and he was used to hatred anyway.\n\n*Kraugel, I'll knock you down.*\n\nThen he'd reach the finals. Then he'd get revenge on Grid.\n\n\"Kilkil.\"\n\nHe laughed and pulled on his mask. Not just any mask. An <span class=\"rarity-epic\">Epic</span> rated item that enhanced his Stealth beyond its normal limits. The host's voice boomed across the arena.\n\n> [The 2nd National Competition's closing ceremony! The PvP event! This is the first match! Start!!]\n\nThe stage was flat and wide. Perfect conditions. Skill cooldowns would reset between matches. Item durability would be restored. Players could go all out without consequences.\n\nTarma didn't hesitate.\n\n*Pahat!*\n\nShadows spread in every direction. He vanished into them, his form dissolving completely. The crowd tensed.\n\n\"Tarma's shadow technique is active!\"\n\n\"Shadow Hiding is superior to Stealth. The emergence point can't be predicted.\"\n\n\"Everyone watching, focus. Tarma will probably emerge near Kraugel any second—\"\n\n*Puok!*\n\nKraugel pressed his palm to the ground. \"Heaven and Earth Rupture.\"\n\n**KRAKRAKRAKRAKRAKRAKRAKRA—**\n\nThe stage exploded. The destruction made earthquakes look gentle. Ground and air shattered with equal violence, force rippling outward in concentric waves.\n\n\"Kuaaaack!\"\n\nTarma burst from the shadows behind Kraugel, screaming. Blood ran from his ears. But his positioning was perfect, directly at Kraugel's back. Through the pain, he drove his dagger forward. PvP damage boost. Poison coating. Everything stacked.\n\nThe blade never connected.\n\nKraugel had already moved. Natural instinct and razor-sharp senses predicted the attack angle before Tarma had finished emerging. White Fang flashed in a clean counter.\n\n\"Cough...!\"\n\nThe sword pierced straight through Tarma's heart. As his health plummeted, Tarma stared into Kraugel's hollow eyes.\n\n*This man is a monster.*\n\nThe only one worthy of first rank. The sky above the sky. A different dimension entirely from Zibal.\n\n\"The sky... above the sky...!\"\n\nDozens of shadows erupted around Tarma's failing body, surrounding Kraugel in a lethal net. Shadow clones materialized from every angle. Who could have predicted shadows being used as a direct attack? Tarma's vision was fading, but he could see Kraugel's momentary surprise at the sheer number of targets.\n\n*He won't be able to cope.*\n\nBut Kraugel's intuition screamed danger. Allowing even one hit could be fatal.\n\nHe activated Super Sensitivity.\n\nHis senses transcended the human realm. Every shadow attack became visible as a slow, predictable arc. He moved through them like water, each dodge perfect, each counter strike finding flesh.\n\n> [Tarma! Logout!]\n\nThe match ended in seconds. Flashy techniques meant nothing against overwhelming superiority.\n\n\"A scam.\"\n\n\"He's almost invincible.\"\n\nThe audience sat stunned. Super Sensitivity gave Kraugel 100% evasion and accuracy for its duration. No matter how many times they watched, they couldn't grasp how he moved. Even the other PvP participants looked unsettled.\n\nApart from the handful called winning candidates, everyone was now terrified of Super Sensitivity.\n\nGrid yawned.\n\n\"Hrmm.\"\n\nHe'd been bored from the start. The match held no interest for him.\n\nThere was no trace of the player who'd struggled against Tarma just weeks ago."
