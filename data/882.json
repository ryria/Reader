  "content": "The black round table gleamed under Reinhardt's afternoon light, ten chairs arranged in perfect symmetry around its circumference. Coke's hands trembled as he took it all in—this couldn't be real.\n\nHe'd barely stepped through the gates of the capital before Lauel's summons arrived. Now here he stood, facing legends.\n\nDemon Brain Lauel. Red Phoenix Godly Archer Jishuka. Lightning Flash Peak Sword. Cold-Blooded Prince Pon. Iron Fist of Justice Regas. Even Bald Vantner sat among them—the meritorious retainers of the Overgeared Kingdom, the architects of its very existence. Without any one of them, Grid would never have claimed his throne.\n\nAfter Grid himself, these were the people Coke admired most in all of Satisfy.\n\nFour seats remained empty. Faker? The shadow would likely refuse such recognition. Perhaps Huroi, Katz, Chris, or Euphemina filled those ranks instead.\n\n*Gulp.*\n\nLantern-bright eyes swept the room. A dream come true—standing before the greatest rankers in each field, the people closest to Grid himself. Naturally, his nerves were shot.\n\n*Clang!*\n\n\"Ah! I-I'm sorry!\"\n\nThe glass slipped from his shaking fingers, water and shards exploding across the floor. Heat crawled up Coke's neck as he scrambled for the pieces.\n\nRegas leaned back with an easy smile. \"Relax. Sit down.\"\n\nVantner's tongue clicked against his teeth. \"This brat protected Queen Irene and Prince Lord? Sure the reports weren't mixed up?\"\n\nPon's silence spoke volumes.\n\n\"A fellow Korean!\" Peak Sword's face lit up like he'd discovered a long-lost brother. \"Coke! I've been following your progress! The DNA of Koreans—forged through blood, sweat, and tears—is second to none! Come, join the Korean Patriotic Association! Only 800,000 won per year! An opportunity to show your patriotism for a mere 800,000 won!\"\n\nThe man's grin said *sucker* more than *brother*.\n\nCoke's disappointment must have shown on his face.\n\n\"Everyone.\"\n\nThe single word cut through the noise like a blade through silk. Jishuka's voice carried that quality—beauty that bypassed the ears and struck directly at the soul. One of South America's most stunning women, and when she spoke, the world listened.\n\n*Ba-dump. Ba-dump.*\n\nWhat wisdom would she share? What insight—\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThe words landed like ice water. \n\n\"Are you all going to shut up, or do I need to make you?\"\n\nVantner and Peak Sword's mouths snapped closed. Two men who'd carved their names into Satisfy's history—the kingdom's shield and the man who'd bested Hero Kraugel himself—reduced to silence before her.\n\n*She truly is the Red Phoenix Godly Archer.* Coke caught himself gaping at her beauty before sanity reasserted itself. This woman had annihilated thousands with a single bow during the Eternal War. The strongest member of a guild overflowing with monsters. Her beauty was merely one facet of something far more dangerous.\n\nHis spine straightened involuntarily.\n\nIn the restored calm, Jishuka turned to Lauel. \"Now. Explain.\"\n\nLauel—the demonic tactician who'd orchestrated Grid's rise to kingship through cunning and schemes, now managing the kingdom's entire government. Coke swallowed hard.\n\nOne hand rose to cover half of Lauel's face in that dramatic gesture he favored. Classic chunni behavior, but it didn't make the man any less intimidating.\n\nTime crawled. Seconds stretched into hours as those blue eyes dissected him, peeling away layers until Coke felt naked under their scrutiny. Everything inside him—every thought, every weakness—laid bare.\n\nHis throat clicked as he swallowed again, tension coiling tighter. *Just tell me why I'm here.*\n\n\"You...\" \n\n\"Yes...!\" The word cracked. His parched throat betrayed him.\n\nLauel sat with crossed legs, chin tilted in studied arrogance. Through the gap in his collar, a smile played across his lips. Meaningful. Knowing.\n\nThe initial excitement of meeting these legends had evaporated, replaced by something approaching awe. These weren't just strong players—they were forces of nature.\n\n\"You are Coke?\"\n\n\"Yes! That's right!\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" The question made no sense.\n\nLauel's eyes widened, gleaming as his gaze lifted. \"The ten meritorious retainers! Isn't it magnificent?\"\n\n\"Meritorious... retainers?\"\n\n\"Kukuku...! Exactly.\" Lauel's laughter rolled through the room. \"In ancient times, there were seven malignant saints who served the gods. Now there will be ten meritorious retainers who serve the Overgeared King.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid had shared the Vatican's secrets, including those enigmatic seven malignant saints. The name had captured Lauel's imagination completely—elegant, powerful, historic. So he'd forged his own answer: ten meritorious retainers, the founders of a new kingdom alongside their king.\n\n\"Magnificent, yes? The world will sing our praises. Our reputation will eclipse legends. And through us, the Overgeared King's authority will pierce the heavens themselves! Huhuhut!\"\n\n\"Ah, yes... Ten... meridorious... retainers...\"\n\n*What is he even talking about?* Stunned, Coke could only nod.\n\nPeak Sword leaned in conspiratorially. \"Pronunciation. Merit, not merid.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nMaybe these legendary retainers were less intimidating than advertised. Especially Peak Sword. Coke's pitying look earned him nothing.\n\nFinally, Lauel arrived at the point.\n\n\"Sir Coke, I heard your saga. You claim to be talented enough to defeat the Red Knights singlehandedly?\"\n\n\"What? N-No, that was King Grid—\"\n\n\"We held a meeting. The decision was unanimous—you will be trained.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Starting today, you study under the ten meritorious retainers. Strategy from me. Archery from Jishuka. Swordsmanship from Peak Sword. Spear and magic from Pon. Martial arts from Regas. Shield techniques from Vantner.\"\n\nThe knight class was supposedly universal—Sword Mastery, Bow Mastery, Spear Mastery all available. In theory, jack of all trades. In practice, a nightmare.\n\nMastery skills only improved through weapon use. Raise Sword Mastery? Use a sword. Spear Mastery? Use a spear. Compared to classes with singular focus, knights crawled toward competency.\n\nMost knight players chose one weapon and stuck with it. Sword, spear, blunt weapon—pick one, grind it, ignore the rest. Focus or fail. That was the knight's reality. NPCs might develop naturally over decades, but players lived on borrowed time.\n\n\"I appreciate the consideration, but I refuse.\"\n\nThe tremor vanished from Coke's voice. For the first time since entering this room, his eyes held steady, meeting Lauel and the retainers without flinching.\n\n\"Wonderful teachers mean nothing against system limitations. If I split my focus, my mastery skills will crawl at a snail's pace. I'll become worthless—a jack of all trades, master of none. Better to focus on swordsmanship like I've been doing. Although...\"\n\n\"Although?\"\n\n\"I'd like to study strategy from Lauel. Knights can learn tactical skills. That knowledge would prove useful...\"\n\n\"Huhut! Bold.\"\n\nRejecting an offer from the kingdom's founding retainers, then negotiating for scraps? In any other nation, such audacity would court disaster. \n\nBut the Overgeared Kingdom's retainers weren't like others. Their expressions warmed.\n\n\"Our personalities are similar.\"\n\n\"Grid's evaluation was accurate.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nHe'd braced for anger. Instead, approval? The whiplash left Coke reeling.\n\nLauel's explanation arrived smoothly. \"Items come in countless varieties. Some make the wearer stronger. Others make them grow faster.\"\n\nField boss loot, typically. Items that accelerated skill progression—uncommon, but obtainable.\n\n\"We've prepared growth items for your training.\"\n\n\"Spent so much time grinding those tedious field bosses,\" Jishuka added.\n\n\"The effects aren't spectacular individually,\" Regas said, \"but we'll support you through it.\"\n\nVantner stood. \"Time's wasting. Let's move to the hunting grounds.\"\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nThey'd known. Prepared. Planned. Of course they had—senior rankers and kingdom founders didn't miss details. His heart hammered as realization struck. They were investing in him.\n\nBut doubt lingered.\n\n\"Why?\" The question escaped before wisdom could stop it. \"Why invest this much in me?\"\n\nThese were busy people. Government affairs, maintaining rankings, endless responsibilities—yet they'd carve time from impossible schedules for him. Why?\n\nLauel answered for them all. \"We must make Grid's declaration reality. Would you be satisfied seeing His Majesty misunderstood as a useless braggart?\"\n\nSimple. Direct. Honest.\n\n\"I'll give everything I have! Thank you, ten meritorious retainers!\"\n\n\"...Let's workshop that name,\" Peak Sword muttered.\n\nLauel's laughter drowned out the request.\n\nThe secret weapon development project of the ten meritorious retainers began that day.\n\n***\n\n*Tang! Tang!*\n\n[You have reached 60% understanding of the First Holy Sword that is Becoming Petrified.]\n\nThree days of work. Over one hundred cycles of disassembly and reassembly.\n\n[The sin of the holy sword's maker is stimulating the Stone of Original Sin!]\n\n\"Sin? The maker's sin?\"\n\nThe holy sword's creator was Hexetia—the blacksmithing god himself.\n\n*A god sinned?*\n\nThe revelation struck like lightning. Before Grid's eyes, the reassembled holy sword began transforming. Petrification spread in real-time, racing across the blade—faster and wider than anything he'd witnessed before. The Stone of Original Sin devoured metal at an accelerating pace.\n\n\"What?!\"\n\nHis hammer flew. Impact after impact, attempting to shock the petrified sections and slow their advance. The method had worked for three days straight.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nThe petrification ignored external stimuli entirely. No matter how hard he struck, the curse spread unabated.\n\n\"Damn it...!\"\n\nThree days of effort, wasted? Cold dread crawled up his spine. One option remained—the desperate play.\n\nGrid hurled the holy sword into the furnace. He'd melt it down, remove the petrified stone during disassembly, reassemble from scratch. \n\nThe blast furnace's heat consumed the blade.\n\nThen came the explosion.\n\nThe furnace detonated, shrapnel and flame erupting outward. The shockwave sent Grid stumbling backward, ears ringing.\n\n\"Impossible...\"\n\nThe half-petrified holy sword floated in empty air, defying gravity and reason.\n\n*—The sins of the gods are covered up?*\n\nAn unknown voice reverberated through his mind.\n\nThe quest had reached its climax. Grid felt it in his bones.\n\n*—You who have succeeded the power of the 4th evil, look upon the sins of the gods!*\n\nAnger saturated every syllable.\n\nWhite light consumed Grid's vision. His consciousness tore free from the Vatican, hurtling through impossible distance to somewhere entirely new.\n\nAsgard. The world of the gods.\n\n***\n\nAt S.A. Group headquarters, Chairman Lim Cheolho stared at his monitors.\n\n\"The second time...\"\n\nGrid had reached another moral crossroads. Good or evil? Light or darkness?\n\nTension lined every crease in Lim Cheolho's face as he waited for Grid's choice."
