The Red Lightning Summoning Bead had fused seamlessly with the Enlightenment Blade, granting an eight percent boost to base damage alongside a devastating new lightning attribute. Best of all? No health penalty.\n\nWhat truly set the red lightning apart from ordinary electrical attacks was its delivery method—it struck from above, a bolt from heaven itself. The damage scaled with his total attack power, carried a high chance of inflicting electric shock, and unless the enemy had eyes on the crown of their skull, they'd never see it coming.\n\nBut the real revelation came moments later, mid-combat.\n\n---\n\n[The option effect of the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has dealt 30% additional fire damage to the target!]\n\n[The target has neutralized the flames.]\n\n[The option effect of the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has added 5,000 fire damage!]\n\n[The target has neutralized the flames.]\n\n[The option effect of the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has dealt 30% additional dark damage to the target!]\n\n[The target has maximized the darkness. The target's dark attribute damage will increase by 10%.]\n\n[Darkness is the power of the undead.]\n\n[The target has recovered 83,200 health.]\n\n[The option effect of the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has dealt 15% additional lightning damage to the target!]\n\n[You have dealt 41,900 damage to the target!]\n\n[The option effect of the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has summoned a red lightning bolt!]\n\n---\n\n**Kwajik!**\n\nThe sky tore open. Unlike the blade's ground-level strikes, the red lightning descended from storm clouds overhead—a crimson spear of judgment piercing the grey heavens.\n\n**Kwarururung!**\n\nThunder rolled across the desolate 63rd island.\n\n**Kuwaaaang!**\n\nThe bolt hammered into Death Knight Kruger, arcing through bone and cursed steel. Light flared in the undead warrior's empty eye sockets as fractures spider-webbed through his ribcage.\n\n---\n\n[You have dealt 195,600 damage to the target!]\n\n[The target is caught in an electric shock for 1.2 seconds!]\n\n---\n\n*Perfect.*\n\nThe lightning's targeting was surgical—single-target, concentrated devastation. Yes, the proc rate was listed as \"low,\" but Grid didn't care. This was a passive skill on a **myth-rated weapon**, consuming no mana, no stamina, and delivering roughly forty percent of the black flames' destructive power.\n\n**Pajijik!**\n\n**Clack! Clack clack!**\n\nKruger seized up, sparks crawling over his skeletal frame like electric serpents. The shock effect locked his movements for one critical second.\n\nOne second was all Grid needed.\n\n\"Now! God Hands—*tear him apart!*\"\n\n---\n\n**Peok!**\n\n**Peok peok peok!**\n\n---\n\n[God Hand (1) has dealt 3,110 damage to the target.]\n\n[The Ultimate Enhanced Mjolnir has caused the target to stiffen for 0.3 seconds.]\n\n[God Hand (2) has dealt 2,030 damage to the target.]\n\n[The +7 Mjolnir (2) has caused the target to stiffen for 0.1 seconds.]\n\n[The God Hand (4)...]\n\n[The +7 Mjolnir (4)...]\n\n...\n\n...\n\n---\n\nThe snowball effect triggered. That single second of electric shock cascaded into an unbreakable rhythm—the God Hands hammered Kruger's skull in perfect rotation, each strike refreshing the stiffness debuff before it could expire. The legendary death knight, who'd spent eighteen minutes crafting some unknown counter-weapon, couldn't so much as raise his arms.\n\n\"God Hands! It's been too long since we've pulled this off!\"\n\nGrid felt the familiar thrill of a perfect combo execution. The God Hands' core programming prioritized protecting their master above all else, which normally made sustained offense impossible—they'd switch to defense the instant Grid took damage. This dual nature was both strength and weakness, and micromanaging four constructs while fighting a boss-tier enemy was a nightmare.\n\nBut the Red Lightning Summoning Bead changed everything. With regular lightning procs buying him control windows, Grid could finally unleash the God Hands' true potential.\n\n**Puk!**\n\n**Puk puk!**\n\nWearing Alex's Quick Gloves, Grid attacked over twice per second. His blade bit into Kruger's frozen form in a relentless cadence, each strike perfectly timed between Mjolnir impacts. Basic attacks blurred together—no breaks, no recovery frames, just continuous pressure.\n\nThen he shifted gears.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship!\"\n\n**Kuoooooh!**\n\nGrid wove a combo chain, canceling basic attack recovery animations directly into skill activations. It was a technique most high-level players mastered early—animation canceling to compress damage windows. Grid had always struggled with it. Pagma's Swordsmanship skills had such long startup motions that weaving in basic attacks was nearly impossible.\n\nUntil now.\n\n**Cheook!**\n\nOne step forward.\n\n**Puok!**\n\nA machine-gun burst of basic attacks.\n\n**Cheook!**\n\nAnother step.\n\n**Puok!**\n\nAnother burst. The Quick Gloves compressed his attack frames so dramatically that Grid could slip basic attacks into the gaps *between* Pagma's Swordsmanship movements. Each step of the sword dance became a platform for additional damage.\n\nBut the real genius came in the next moment.\n\n---\n\n[Alex's Quick Gloves have been released.]\n\n[You have equipped the +8 Holy Light Gloves.]\n\n---\n\nDuring the stiffness windows, Grid had time to swap equipment. He'd use Quick Gloves to execute the skill at maximum speed, then immediately switch to Holy Light Gloves before the damage registered—ensuring he gained the gloves' holy damage bonuses and additional effect proc chances.\n\n\"Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle.\"\n\n**Kuooooooh!**\n\nThese were the skills that had overwhelmed Yatan's Servant Malacus back when Grid was still finding his footing as Pagma's Descendant. Even Death Knight Kruger, a legend reduced to undeath, recognized the existential threat.\n\n**Clack!**\n\n**Clack clack!**\n\nKruger thrashed desperately, skeletal limbs straining against invisible chains. But escape was impossible. The God Hands' Mjolnir barrage maintained perfect infinite stiffness—a technique so powerful it resembled a game-breaking exploit when executed flawlessly.\n\n**Pit!**\n\n**Pipipipipit!**\n\nEnergy blades erupted in a storm.\n\n**Peng!**\n\n**Pepepepeng!**\n\nFire and black flames detonated in overlapping shockwaves.\n\nThen—\n\n**Kurururung!**\n\nRed lightning lanced down from the heavens, detonating against Kruger's skull.\n\n**Kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa kwa!**\n\n---\n\n[You have dealt 132,790 damage to the target!]\n\n[You have dealt 145,840 damage to the target!]\n\n[You have dealt 170,900 damage to the target!]\n\n[You have dealt 188,050 damage to the target!]\n\n[You have dealt...]\n\n...\n\n...\n\n[The option effect 'Black Flames' has activated from the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires!]\n\n[Critical!]\n\n[The effect of the title 'Death in One Shot!' has been activated, adding 30% critical damage!]\n\n[You have dealt 926,430 damage to the target!]\n\n[The option effect 'Black Flames' has activated from the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires!]\n\n...\n\n...\n\n[The option effect of the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has summoned a red lightning bolt!]\n\n[Critical!]\n\n[The effect of the title 'Death in One Shot!' has been...]\n\n[The +8 Holy Light Gloves's option effect is activated, causing the skill '5 Joint Attacks' to be....]\n\n...\n\n...\n\n[You have dealt 3,235,900 damage to the target.]\n\n[The option effect 'Black Flames' has activated from the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires!]\n\n[You have dealt...]\n\n...\n\n...\n\n---\n\n\"**KIYAAAAAH!**\"\n\nKruger's roar shook the island—not a scream of agony (the undead felt no pain), but pure, impotent fury. He'd been rendered helpless, a legendary figure reduced to a punching bag.\n\nAnd Grid wasn't finished. The Link portion of Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle was merely the appetizer.\n\n**Puk.**\n\n**Puk puk! Puuoook!**\n\nThe energy blades shifted trajectory mid-flight, abandoning their chaotic orbits to strike in a unified straight line. They punched through Kruger's torso, the purple glow in his bones flickering as the impact overloaded his cursed existence.\n\n---\n\n[You have dealt 310,100 damage to the target!]\n\n[You have dealt 343,000 damage to the target!]\n\n[You have dealt 379,300 damage to the target...]\n\n...\n\n...\n\n[Critical!]\n\n[The effect of the title 'Death in One Shot!' has been...]\n\n[You have dealt 1,102,500 damage to the target.]\n\n[The option effect 'Black Flames' has activated from the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires!]\n\n[The option effect of the Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has summoned a red lightning bolt!]\n\n---\n\n**Kwarung!**\n\n**Kwarururung!**\n\nNatural disasters paled in comparison. The vortex of destruction—blades, flames, and lightning—consumed Kruger in an unrelenting maelstrom. Grid felt an unexpected pang of sympathy. This had once been a man, a legend who fought to save the world.\n\n\"Ah... Ahhh...\"\n\n---\n\nOn the 62nd island, Sticks watched through his crystal ball, face drained of color. His hands trembled. His heart—weak even by elf standards—hammered against his ribs as Grid's offensive capabilities shattered every reasonable expectation. This wasn't player damage. This was apocalyptic.\n\n---\n\n**Duguen! Duguen!**\n\nThe assault crescendoed. Wave after Wave after Kill after Pinnacle—the storm of death shredded Kruger into fragments. Then the finisher descended.\n\n**Jjejejeok!**\n\nKruger's skull cracked like pottery under Pinnacle's devastating blow. The instant Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle completed, Grid swapped back to Alex's Quick Gloves and resumed his basic attack pressure.\n\n*Still has thirty percent health. Tough bastard.*\n\nObjectively, Grid knew he should be astonished—he'd just deleted seventy percent of a named boss's health pool with a single skill rotation. His damage output had transcended player standards entirely, entering the realm of environmental hazards.\n\nBut Grid was already thinking three moves ahead.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship!\"\n\nHe initiated the finishing sequence. Basic attack, swap to Holy Light Gloves mid-animation, then—\n\n\"Linked Kill!\"\n\n**Puk.**\n\n**Puk puk puk!**\n\nGrid hammered into Kruger five more times. The fifth strike wasn't a critical, leaving him mildly disappointed, but he resisted the urge to transform a God Hand into Lifael's Spear. The math was simple: losing even one Mjolnir risked breaking the infinite stiffness chain. If Kruger got a single action frame, the death knight might turn the tables.\n\n*No need to rush. The prey's already caught.*\n\nPatience. Control. These were the hallmarks of a true combatant. Grid maintained the rhythm—Linked Kill flowed into Transcended Link, then Pinnacle Kill, then Link again. God's Command triggered on the second rotation, allowing him to execute Pinnacle Kill twice.\n\nTen minutes of methodical, surgical violence.\n\n---\n\n**Kurururu!**\n\nDeath Knight Kruger, guardian of the 63rd island and legendary tailor who'd fought alongside Sword Saint Muller, crumbled into grey light. The mysterious item he'd spent eighteen minutes crafting during the battle—likely his trump card—remained unused in his inventory. His weakness to status effects had made him the perfect victim for the God Hands and Mjolnir combination.\n\n---\n\n[You have defeated Death Knight Kruger, guardian of the 63rd island!]\n\n[The 63rd island has been cleansed!]\n\n[As a reward for cleansing the island, you have gained one level!]\n\n[You have acquired Kruger's tailoring tools!]\n\n[You have acquired Kruger's Mysterious Cloth!]\n\n---\n\nGrid exhaled slowly, shoulders finally relaxing. The Lightning Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires hummed in his grip, residual electricity crackling along the blade.\n\n\"Worth every resource,\" he murmured.\n\nBehind him, the four God Hands hovered in formation, golden hammers still gripped tight—silent, loyal, and utterly terrifying."
