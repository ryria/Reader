If Madra had successfully executed the 300,000 Army Massacre Sword, Grid would have fallen. But the death knight's deteriorated body couldn't sustain the technique. And then—by fortune or fate—Grid's God's Command passive activated, resetting his cooldowns at the critical moment.\n\nA knife's edge. A single misstep from disaster.\n\n\"Grid...!\" Sticks exhaled, his voice trembling with relief and pride. \"I knew you would prevail.\"\n\nHeroes didn't climb from the earth. They descended from the heavens—chosen, guided, inevitable. Sticks understood this truth through centuries of astronomical study. The constellations didn't lie: Grid moved beneath Rebecca's favor, the Goddess of Light herself watching over him.\n\nBut was it merely divine providence? \n\nNo. Grid had forged this path with his own hands.\n\nHe'd purged the corruption from the Rebecca Church, toppling an evil pope. He'd earned the adoration of Rebecca's Daughters and installed a righteous pontiff. Through these deeds, he'd captured the goddess's heart. The heavens didn't simply choose him—he'd *made* himself worthy.\n\n\"Truly extraordinary...\"\n\nHigh Elf Sticks rarely praised humans. The words felt foreign on his tongue, yet entirely deserved. He rose on unsteady legs, his body still trembling from the intensity of what he'd witnessed. After more than a century, the Behen Archipelago stood cleansed. Purified. *Free.*\n\nEvery fiber of his being urged him to rush to the 66th island, to embrace Grid and share in this triumph.\n\nYet he held himself back.\n\nThrough the crystal ball, he watched Grid standing motionless—head bowed before Madra's fading light, then turning to study the stone monuments of fallen legends. When Grid's own statue materialized beside them, the young man simply stared, overwhelmed.\n\nThis moment belonged to Grid alone. Sticks would not intrude.\n\nHe waited.\n\nThen Fog Island materialized, and the golden carriage emerged in its characteristic flash of light.\n\n*Now.*\n\nSticks channeled his magic and transported himself to the Hall of Fame just as Grid approached the mysterious vehicle. Surely the young hero would welcome his arrival, still riding the high of victory—\n\n\"*Fuck!*\"\n\nSticks materialized to the sound of Grid's voice echoing through the sacred chamber.\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThe Hall of Fame—that most hallowed space where legends were born—rang with profanity.\n\n*What in the—*\n\nThe atmosphere had completely soured in mere minutes. Grid whirled toward him, eyes bloodshot with fury.\n\n\"Sticks! Don't tell me you're working with this *goddamn carriage!*\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nAh. Poor timing.\n\nSticks suppressed a weary sigh. He'd momentarily forgotten Grid's... mercurial nature.\n\n***\n\n\"Fog Island and the golden carriage were established to aid those who challenged the Behen Archipelago,\" Sticks explained patiently. \"Now that the archipelago has been cleansed, there's no further need to cultivate challengers. The elixirs, the skill books—they've served their purpose. Naturally, they've been removed.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Grid's jaw tightened. \"So why are the *only* things left these damn continental movement scrolls?\"\n\n\"...Most people would celebrate such a reward.\"\n\nGrid glared at him, but Sticks held firm. The portal scrolls that enabled travel to the East Continent had become exceedingly rare. Grid had just secured the opportunity to purchase them in bulk—a strategic advantage any kingdom would covet.\n\nBut Grid wasn't thinking like a king. He was thinking like someone who already had Sticks.\n\n\"I can produce those scrolls myself,\" Grid muttered. \"Why would I waste points on them?\"\n\n\"Because it takes me considerable time to craft each one,\" Sticks countered. \"You should be grateful for the efficiency.\"\n\n\"I suppose...\" Grid's attention kept drifting back to one particular item in the carriage's inventory. \"But the diary...\"\n\nInitially, he'd been outraged. A *diary?* What kind of legendary reward was a diary? But doubt crept in. This was Madra's personal gift—the Undefeated King wouldn't mock him from beyond death. And the price: one million points. That wasn't arbitrary.\n\nSticks smiled, reading the conflict on Grid's face.\n\n\"Then trust your instincts. Purchase the diary.\"\n\n*You have the love of a goddess,* he thought, but kept the words locked away. Pride and complacency would destroy Grid faster than any death knight.\n\n\"Based on everything I know about Madra...\" Grid spoke slowly, working through the logic. \"He wouldn't set a trap.\"\n\nThe war between practicality and intuition played across Grid's features. A mountain of East Continent movement scrolls would revolutionize the Overgeared Kingdom's logistics, enabling rapid deployment and trade routes that other nations could only dream of.\n\n*But the Undefeated King's legacy...*\n\nThat scale tipped.\n\n\"I'll take Madra's diary!\"\n\n[One million challenger points have been consumed to purchase Death Knight Madra's Diary.]\n\nThe item materialized in Grid's inventory. His hand twitched toward his interface, desperate to read it immediately—\n\nSticks bowed, deep and formal.\n\n\"Grid. I am profoundly grateful. You have cleansed the Behen Archipelago and restored the Hall of Fame—the sacred bridge between legends past and legends yet to come.\"\n\n[Sage Sticks thanks you for fulfilling his desire for the purification of the Behen Archipelago!]\n\n[Sage Sticks has granted you a new title!]\n\n\"You are the hero of heroes, the one who laid the suffering legends to rest.\" Sticks raised his head, his ancient eyes gleaming. \"Henceforth, I shall call you the Hero King.\"\n\n[The title 'Hero King' has been obtained.]\n\n**[Hero King]**\n*A hero of heroes. You are a living myth.*\n\n* The Hero King shines among heroes. Deal 10% additional damage to all unique-or-higher rated classes.\n* The Hero King stands as arbiter of the world's peace. Deal 15% additional damage to great demons, archangels, dragons, and demigods. Reduce damage taken from them by 15%.\n* The Hero King's pride is absolute. Conscious of his supremacy, he is always full of fighting energy.\n\n**[Fighting Energy]**\n*A special resource exclusive to the Hero King.*\nMaintained at 10 normally; rises to 100 during combat.\nHigher fighting energy increases all stats proportionally.\nWarning: Penalties apply if fighting energy drops below 10.\n\n*Chwaruururuk!*\n\nThe fighting energy gauge materialized in Grid's status window—a third bar joining health and mana. A translucent purple aura began to rise from his body like heat shimmer, the visual manifestation of his new power.\n\n\"Magnificent!\"\n\nSticks radiated genuine admiration. The energy surrounding Grid carried both ferocity and solemnity—the bearing of true royalty.\n\nGrid, meanwhile, looked like he'd bitten into a lemon.\n\nHis mind had immediately jumped to Iyarugt's \"Coolness\" stat—that worthless, infuriating option that served no practical purpose. Just another reminder of the gold-sink alchemy facility gathering dust in his kingdom. Resources poured into a facility that produced nothing but frustration.\n\nThen his expression twitched.\n\nThe corners of his mouth curved upward despite his best efforts. His body wanted to dance, dignity be damned. He was the *only one* among two billion players wreathed in purple energy. Unique. Special. *Visible.*\n\n*I'll stand out in any crowd. Even among two billion players, I'll be unmistakable.*\n\nThe realization hit like lightning. He was genuinely, undeniably special.\n\nAnd then, just as quickly, his face fell.\n\n*Who cares if they're looking at an ugly face?*\n\nGrid's perpetual insecurity about his appearance crushed his moment of joy. He cycled rapidly between elation and dejection, his expressions shifting so fast that Sticks grew concerned.\n\n*Did the former legends curse him? Has he lost his mind?*\n\nBefore Sticks could intervene, another world message blazed across the sky.\n\n[Overgeared King Grid, who gave rest to the heroes of past generations, has been recognized as the hero of heroes. Behold the birth of Hero King Grid, who will transcend history and ascend to myth.]\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, in Grid's subconscious:\n\n—*That abominable elf...*\n\nBraham's hostility toward Sticks burned hotter than ever. The animosity between demonkin and elves ran deep, but this transcended ancient prejudice. The title \"Hero King\" carried specific weight.\n\nIt had belonged to Sword Saint Muller.\n\n—*Making Grid shoulder Muller's burden... I'll tear down this legacy even if I must claw my way back from hell itself.*\n\n***\n\nAt the entrance to the Behen Archipelago, reporters clustered like carrion birds around a carcass.\n\n\"Another world message? And it's Grid *again?*\"\n\n\"This is massive!\"\n\n*Hero of heroes? Myth?*\n\nThe words electrified the press corps. Fingers flew over keyboards and interface windows as journalists scrambled to be first.\n\n\"Logging out!\"\n\n\"Me too!\"\n\nThe crowd dissolved as reporters raced to file their stories. Within minutes, articles flooded every news outlet and forum:\n\n**[Hero of Heroes! Hero King Grid is Born! Does This Confirm a Myth-Class?]**\n\n**[Kraugel No Longer Stands Alone]**\n\n**[(Column) Hero of Heroes: A New Sky Above the Sky]**\n\nThe Grid phenomenon swept online and offline media worldwide. Broadcasting networks launched emergency debates and analysis segments, all centered on one question: What did Hero King Grid mean for the future of Satisfy?\n\n***\n\n\"Keke... Kekeke. I can't deny it anymore.\"\n\nAgnus stared at the world message, his laughter hollow and bitter. The protagonist wasn't Kraugel this time—it was *Grid.* The shock lasted only moments before acceptance settled in. The Grid he'd faced possessed genuine strength. Denying reality served no purpose.\n\n\"But...\"\n\nWhat about Kraugel?\n\n\"He... He's not falling, is he?\"\n\nEven as the thought formed, Agnus dismissed it. Impossible. Absurd.\n\nThe sky would never fall.\n\n***\n\nIn South Korea, in a small vegetable field on the outskirts of town:\n\n\"Oh my! Your son's a Hero King now?\"\n\n\"First a king, then the Overgeared King, and now *Hero* King? He's incredible!\"\n\n\"You're all saying it wrong—his name is Youngwoo, so it's *King Youngwoo!*\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nShin Youngwoo's parents still operated their modest vegetable stand. They'd risen before dawn to tend the fields, as they did every day. But now, neighbors and distant relatives alike descended upon them with congratulations and barely-disguised requests.\n\n—Uncle! Tell Youngwoo I'll drop out of school to join the Overgeared Guild! I'll grind day and night! Please, just put in a word!\n\n—Oh, cousin! Remember how I always said your boy would succeed? Well, my daughter just became a flight attendant—gorgeous girl, stunning. Have Youngwoo bring her into Overgeared! What do you mean, what does Inyoung have to do with anything? She's *pretty!* Connect her with someone important!\n\n\"...\"\n\nSuccess changed everything. The same people who'd pitied or mocked their son now clamored for his favor. \n\nBut if the relatives felt proud, imagine how Youngwoo's parents felt.\n\n\"Honey!\" His mother's eyes shone. \"We should do more volunteer work on behalf of our son. He's too busy to do it himself!\"\n\n\"The cabbages this season are exceptional,\" his father agreed, already planning. \"Let's donate them.\"\n\n\"In Youngwoo's name, of course. Always in Youngwoo's name.\"\n\nThanks to their son, Shin Youngwoo's parents walked with light steps and lighter hearts. They were grateful—so deeply grateful—that despite their inability to provide much, their boy had given his absolute best.\n\nThey wished every parent in the world could have a child like Youngwoo."
