His first in nearly a year of grinding through Satisfy's endless cycle of mediocrity.\n\n*The skill called Unbreakable Justice... I've never heard of it. But Courage? I've heard rumors. Every ten points permanently boosts attack and defense.*\n\nHis breathing quickened.\n\n*If I succeed... if I get the Apostle of Justice title... I can finally climb the rankings.*\n\nLevel 127. Respectable by most standards. High enough that NPCs treated him with deference, that other players nodded when he passed. But not high enough. Not for someone who'd been here since day one, grinding eighteen hours daily for twelve brutal months.\n\nThe orator class was his prison. Combat classes hunted. Production classes crafted. Both paths led to steady, reliable experience. But an orator? Words were his only weapon, and words didn't kill monsters. Words didn't forge swords.\n\nHe'd survived by talking his way into quests, sweet-talking NPCs into handing over objectives that would've required bloodshed for anyone else. But that well had run dry. Higher levels meant harder quests. Less experience. Diminishing returns. While other players carved through dungeons or sold their wares, he shuttled back and forth on errands that barely moved his experience bar.\n\n*I need to hunt. But how?*\n\nThe weapons available to orators could be counted on one hand. His health pool was laughable, the lowest of any class. His combat stats were garbage. His skills? Designed for negotiation, not confrontation. He couldn't even kill a monster fifteen levels below him without nearly dying in the process.\n\nSpiteful Tongue was powerful, yes. The stat debuff could cripple enemies. But it required time, focus, precision. In a real fight, when claws were ripping into him and fangs sought his throat, there was no time for eloquent speeches.\n\n*The courage stat could change everything. Cover my weakness. Make me viable.*\n\nHe quickened his pace toward the western gate, resolve hardening with each step.\n\nThe gate loomed ahead, quieter than the others. The lord's iron grip on Winston meant residents rarely left. Only travelers moved freely, a trickle rather than a flood.\n\n\"Thank you for your hard work.\" Huroi approached the gate guards, offering a respectful nod as he produced his identification.\n\nThe soldiers moved to block his path.\n\nHis stomach dropped.\n\n*No. The Mero Company. They know.*\n\nPanic clawed up his throat. One year. One year of waiting for an opportunity like this, and it would die here if he couldn't slip past two guards.\n\n\"What reason do you have for stopping me?\" Huroi kept his voice level, professional. \"Surely there's been some mistake?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nThe guards stared past him, through him, as though he didn't exist. Their expressions were carved from stone.\n\n*They're not even acknowledging me.*\n\nHuroi pivoted, already mapping alternative routes in his mind.\n\n\"No matter what you say, they won't respond.\"\n\nThe voice froze him mid-step. His heart hammered against his ribs.\n\nRabbit. The Mero Company's administrator, the man who'd hired him, stood five paces away wearing a smile that didn't reach his eyes.\n\n\"I instructed them not to react to anything you say,\" Rabbit continued, \"until they receive a signal from me.\"\n\nHuroi forced his face into neutral pleasantness, burying the terror. \"Mr. Rabbit. Shouldn't you be busy with business in your office?\"\n\n\"I had a headache. Fresh air helps.\"\n\n\"Of course. Relaxation is vital for productivity.\" Huroi gestured at the guards. \"But why this... unusual instruction? Surely you don't mean to rob me of the joy of conversation? I'm wounded, truly.\"\n\nRabbit's grin widened, predatory. \"Mr. Huroi, you have an obligation. Our contract was clear. You instigate the residents, then report to me. Instead, you're fleeing Winston without a word. How should I interpret that?\"\n\nHuroi spread his hands, the picture of innocence. \"In order for words to serve as weapons, there must be cracks in the mind of the opponent. Leverage points. I'm waiting for the right moment to act. These things can't be rushed. The scenery near Winston is famous. I thought I'd enjoy it while I waited. Leaving Winston permanently? A misunderstanding.\"\n\nRabbit's eyebrows rose. \"Is that so? I've misunderstood your intentions?\"\n\n*Got him.* Huroi's Persuasion skill was high. His persuasive power stat, higher still. He'd talked his way past nobles, convinced merchants to give him discounts, sweet-talked quest objectives from skeptical NPCs. One administrator shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\"Yes, a complete misunderstanding. So if you could direct the soldiers to let me pass?\"\n\nVictory was so close he could taste it.\n\n\"I see.\" Rabbit's expression shifted to something resembling regret. \"I thought your eloquence was exceptional, Mr. Huroi. I believed you could easily sway the residents. But now you seem... incompetent. I admit I overestimated your abilities.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\n\"This morning, the Mero Company distributed flyers across the village as scheduled. The residents who read them will be confused. Wavering. Their minds are cracked wide open.\" Rabbit's eyes gleamed. \"Now is the perfect time for you to enter and dazzle them with your words, tilt their hearts toward the Mero Company. Yet here you are, fleeing. Either you lack the ability to read the situation... or you've betrayed me.\"\n\nHuroi's throat went dry.\n\nRabbit's gaze was a hawk's, sharp and unforgiving. It pinned Huroi in place, stripping away pretense.\n\n*He knew.* The realization hit like a punch. \"You predicted this from the start. You expected me to try manipulating the guards, so you ordered them not to speak to me.\"\n\nRabbit shook his head slowly. \"I've met and managed many people, Mr. Huroi. I've learned never to trust anyone. I didn't predict your betrayal. I simply assumed the possibility and prepared for the worst.\" He gestured casually. \"Now, come along. You'll be locked up for a while. Since you've joined the residents instead of persuading them, I certainly can't allow you to reach Earl Steim.\"\n\nThe soldiers closed in.\n\n*This is it. I can't fight my way out. I'll be trapped. The quest will fail. No. I can't give up!*\n\nA hidden quest. His first. Possibly his last. He couldn't let it slip away.\n\n*Forget acting rashly. Log out. Escape the immediate crisis. I can think clearly outside the game and find a solution.*\n\n\"Logout!\"\n\n> [You can't shut down the game here.]\n\nThe words on the notification window might as well have been a death sentence.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Stop your futile resistance!\" A soldier grabbed his arm, wrenching it behind his back.\n\n\"Ugh!\" Huroi struggled as they bound his wrists, rope biting into skin.\n\nRabbit's voice dripped with mockery. \"Logout. That mysterious spell that carries your immortal bodies to an unknown place. Did you think we lacked the power to neutralize it?\"\n\n*He knows about users. He knows we're different. And he's planned for it.*\n\n\"Lock him in the castle's dungeon,\" Rabbit instructed the soldiers. \"Inform the lord he requires close supervision.\"\n\n\"No... this can't...\"\n\nOne year. One year of waiting, and the first quest he'd received was ending in failure before it even began.\n\nDespair crushed down on him like a physical weight.\n\nThen a new window flashed into existence.\n\n> [The quest 'For the Residents of Winston (A)' has changed to 'Wait (S)'.]\n\n> **[Wait]**\n> **Difficulty: S**\n> \n> Having fallen into Rabbit's trap, you have failed to report the Winston lord and Mero Company's crimes to Earl Steim. Fortunately, hope remains.\n> \n> Winston Castle's dungeon is known to be impossible to escape from. In the dark, cold, and unsanitary cell, you must somehow survive until the end. If you can endure the cold and hunger, the Apostle of Justice will surely come and rescue you.\n> \n> **Quest Clear Conditions:** Don't log out for 50 hours in real time.\n> \n> *This is an extremely dangerous quest. For the elderly and those with weak health, please give up on this quest.*\n> \n> [Would you like to accept the quest?]\n\nHuroi's mind reeled.\n\n*What kind of quest is this? Fifty hours in real time? Not Satisfy time?*\n\nHis physical condition in reality was good. Excellent, even. He regularly pulled twenty-hour sessions in the capsule without issue. But twenty hours was the limit. The capsule's safety system forcibly ejected users after twenty hours, then locked them out for six.\n\nThe S.A Group, the developers themselves, had implemented that restriction. They'd warned that exceeding twenty hours was dangerous. And now there was a quest demanding fifty?\n\n*Fifty hours in reality... that's eight days and eight hours in Satisfy. Can my mind endure sitting in a prison cell doing nothing for that long?*\n\nThis was dangerous. Truly dangerous. Not dangerous in the game sense of losing experience or items, but dangerous to his actual psyche. The quest could break him mentally.\n\nBut it was also an opportunity.\n\n*This was A-grade. Now it's S-grade. I can't... I can't miss this.*\n\nHuroi took a steadying breath and thought through the logistics. Did he have unavoidable obligations in reality? No. His calendar was clear. Family who might forcibly shut down his capsule? He lived alone. Was his apartment secure? He'd been home for four days straight. The door was locked. When had he last eaten or used the bathroom? Three hours ago. The capsule's sleep mode could sustain his body for three days without food or water if necessary.\n\nDid he have health issues that might complicate extended connection? No. He was in peak condition.\n\n*Alright. My body can handle this. The S.A Group created this quest. They wouldn't design something that could kill the user.*\n\n\"I won't give up the quest.\"\n\n> [This is the last warning. Are you really sure you want to proceed with the quest?]\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n> [The quest has been accepted.]\n\nThe window expanded, text scrolling past his vision.\n\n> **[Wait]**\n> **Difficulty: S**\n> \n> Having fallen into Rabbit's trap, you have failed to report the Winston lord and Mero Company's crimes to Earl Steim. Fortunately, hope remains.\n> \n> Winston Castle's dungeon is known to be impossible to escape from. In the dark, cold, and unsanitary cell, you must somehow survive until the end. If you can endure the cold and hunger, the Apostle of Justice will surely come and rescue you.\n> \n> **Quest Clear Conditions:** Don't log out for 50 hours in real time.\n> \n> *This is an extremely dangerous quest. For the elderly and those with weak health, please give up on this quest.*\n> \n> *From the moment you accept the quest, the system will thoroughly manage and supervise your brain waves and health status in real time. If critical anomalies are detected, the system will force you to log out.*\n> \n> *If you are forcibly logged out, S.A. Group will send executives and medical staff to your home to prepare for the worst.*\n> \n> *Even if you complete the quest and log out successfully, S.A. Group will send executives and medical staff to visit you and check your status.*\n> \n> *You need to endure 200 hours of Satisfy time to complete the quest. Because you are connected to virtual reality for an extended period, you may confuse reality with virtual reality in the worst case. Please maintain your awareness until the last moment and show a strong mentality.*\n> \n> **Quest Clear Reward:** Second class 'Apostle of Justice's Partner.' Title 'One who Overcomes Hardships.'\n> \n> **Apostle of Justice's Partner:** The 'Courage' stat will be opened. If you are with the Apostle of Justice, all stats will increase by 20%. The skill 'Unbreakable Justice' will be generated. The skill 'Sacrifice for Justice' will be generated.\n> \n> **One who Overcomes Hardships:** The 'Indomitable' stat will be opened. The skill 'Strong Will' will be generated.\n> \n> **Quest Failure:** No penalty.\n\n> [From now on, the capsule will switch to sleep mode.]\n\n> [It is impossible to shut off the power of the capsule from the outside.]\n\n> [If there are external shocks or attempts to shut off the capsule, an employee of S.A. will be sent to your residence to protect the capsule.]\n\n> [We applaud your challenge. Good luck.]\n\nHuroi exhaled slowly as the soldiers dragged him toward the castle. A strange calm settled over him.\n\n*I feel like a VIP customer.*\n\nThe S.A Group's thoroughness was almost comforting. Real-time monitoring. Medical staff on standby. Forced logout protocols if his health crashed. They'd thought of everything.\n\n*Don't worry anymore. My spirit can endure 200 hours.*\n\nHis remaining doubts evaporated, replaced by steely determination.\n\nThe dungeon entrance yawned before him, a black mouth swallowing light.\n\n*I'll wait. Apostle of Justice, whoever you are. If you save me... if you help me clear this quest... I'll serve you loyally, even if you're just an NPC.*\n\nThe iron door clanged shut behind him. Darkness consumed everything.\n\nHuroi settled onto the cold stone floor, closed his eyes, and began to wait.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**  \n**OG:** Glossary Link.  \n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.  \n\n*Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and achieve the goals for extra chapters.
