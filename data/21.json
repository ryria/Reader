They usually left at 5 a.m., making today a rare exception.\n\n*They stayed for me.*\n\nMy throat tightened. I couldn't remember the last time my stomach had felt this full.\n\nI collapsed onto the couch, drifting in and out of consciousness until footsteps woke me. Sehee had changed into her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt made her look like she'd stepped out of a catalog. She was my sister, but even I had to admit she was beautiful.\n\n\"What?\" She crossed her arms. \"Why are you staring?\"\n\n\"I'm glad to see you.\" The words came out softer than I intended. \"You grew up well.\"\n\n\"W-What are you saying all of a sudden?!\" Red bloomed across her cheeks. Her fist connected with my forearm.\n\n*What? Did I say something wrong?*\n\nThe impact sent a strange, cool sensation through my muscle. Like a massage.\n\n\"Ahh, that's good. Hit me again. More. Keep going.\"\n\n\"Kyaaak! Pervert!\"\n\nHer palm cracked against my cheek.\n\nI clutched my stinging face. \"Why did you—\"\n\n\"I filled the tub with hot water.\" Sehee's voice was sharp, but her eyes wouldn't meet mine. \"So your body will feel better. You perverted... you.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes...\"\n\n*But why am I a pervert?*\n\nShe grabbed her bag and stormed out. The door slammed. I sat there, confused but grateful. She always took care of me, even when she was angry.\n\nThe hot water worked wonders on my aching muscles. After drying off, I opened my banking app and transferred the loan interest payment. Watching the money disappear made my stomach turn.\n\n\"Ugh... This world is hell...\"\n\nI needed stability. I needed Satisfy.\n\n*How much did the arrows sell for?*\n\nI climbed into the capsule.\n\n\"Login.\"\n\nThe door sealed shut with a soft hiss. Darkness swallowed my vision. The familiar music swelled, then light burst through.\n\nCool air filled my lungs. The medieval village materialized around me, cobblestones beneath my feet, timber buildings rising on either side.\n\n\"Status window.\"\n\n---\n\n**[Name: Grid]**  \n**Level: 3** (75/500)  \n**Class: Pagma's Descendant**\n\n* Probability of adding additional options when making items increases\n* Probability of item enhancement increases  \n* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally (Penalties apply based on item rating)\n\n**Title: One who Became a Legend**\n\n* Abnormal conditions reduced\n* Will not die when health reaches minimum\n* Easily acknowledged\n\n**Health:** 336/336 | **Mana:** 87/87  \n**Strength:** 24 (+5) | **Stamina:** 22 | **Agility:** 16 | **Intelligence:** 29  \n**Dexterity:** 55 | **Persistence:** 21  \n**Composure:** 14 | **Indomitable:** 16 | **Dignity:** 14 | **Insight:** 14\n\n**Stat Points:** 60\n\n**Weight:** 3,095/1,000\n\n> *Weight limit exceeded by 200%. Movement speed reduced by 100%. Body is heavy and cannot exert power properly. High probability of 'Weakened' state.*\n\n---\n\n\"Level 3...\" I grinned. \"Is that really the case?\"\n\nThe epic-rated item had boosted my stats significantly. With 60 unspent points, I was effectively level 26. Equip Mamon's Greatsword and Mengel's Plate Armor, and I'd match a level 50 player.\n\n*Is this what superiority feels like?*\n\nI stood in the crowded square, one hand on my hip, laughing at nothing. Women passing by whispered to each other.\n\n\"What's with that guy? Standing like that, laughing to himself.\"\n\n\"Ego trip? Main character syndrome?\"\n\n\"He's ugly. Probably doesn't have a girlfriend.\"\n\nNormally, their words would sting. Today, I was too thrilled to care. I pulled up my skill window.\n\n**[Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship Skill]** Lv 1 (3.7%)  \n**[Legendary Blacksmith's Breath]** Lv 1 (2.0%)\n\nThe progress was faster than expected.\n\n*Must be from making the epic item.*\n\nI headed toward the auction house. The building buzzed with activity, players packed shoulder to shoulder at every counter.\n\n*What's the winning bid?*\n\nRegular Jaffa Arrows sold for six silver each. Mine were epic-rated. Three to four times the price seemed reasonable. Equipment followed a pattern: rare items cost three times normal, epic seven times. But arrows were consumables. Would anyone spend that much?\n\n*Don't expect too much.*\n\nI'd be satisfied with double the price. I opened the auction window.\n\n\"K-Keok...!\"\n\nMy jaw dropped.\n\n\"Isn't that the guy from the square? The one laughing to himself? Oh my god, what's he doing now? His mouth is hanging open.\"\n\n\"Kyaaak! His saliva is dripping! Disgusting!\"\n\n\"So ugly... Definitely single.\"\n\n\"Argh... Uhhh...\"\n\nI tried to close my mouth. Failed.\n\n---\n\n**[Special Jaffa Arrow]** (99 Pieces)  \n**[Bid Price: 72 silver per piece]**\n\n---\n\nTwelve times the normal price.\n\n\"Eh... uh... aack...\"\n\nMy hands shook as I pulled out the calculator, a default item every user received. 99 × 72 = ?\n\n\"...7,128...\"\n\nOne hundred silver equaled one gold. Seven thousand, one hundred twenty-eight silver meant seventy-one gold and twenty-eight silver. One hundred gold converted to roughly 120,000 won in cash.\n\n*I made these in about a day.*\n\nGame time, not real time. Less than six real hours for approximately 84,000 won.\n\n\"Ha... hahaha...\"\n\nLaughter erupted from my chest. \"Puhahahahat!\"\n\n\"That guy's lost it!\"\n\n\"So ugly! Definitely single! Probably only has his mom's number saved under 'female contacts.'\"\n\n*Do they have to be so sharp?*\n\nNo. I refused to let them shake me.\n\n*Think what you want.*\n\nI could smile through anything right now.\n\n*I can see the path forward.*\n\nDebt?\n\n\"I'll pay it back in the game!\"\n\nLabor jobs were obsolete. Creating items was more profitable. Pagma's Descendant truly was a goose that laid golden eggs.\n\nI clenched my fist as the auctioneer slid coins across the counter. I frowned. The amount was short.\n\n\"Why only sixty gold and fifty-nine silver?\"\n\nThe manager smiled. \"Sales commission reduces your total by ten gold and sixty-nine silver. Epic-rated items carry a 15% fee. Thank you for your patronage.\"\n\nNormal items: 8% commission. Rare: 10%. Epic: 15%.\n\n*What about unique or legendary?*\n\nThe auction house suddenly reminded me of Mother's Heart is Happy. Exploitation looked the same everywhere, reality or game.\n\n\"Shit... I'll become successful enough to exploit the weak myself...\"\n\nI'd produce legendary items no one else could make. Two billion users would bow before Pagma's Descendant.\n\n\"But that's the distant future.\"\n\nTears stung my eyes thinking about the 15% commission. Yesterday, I'd missed the chance to open a stall because of work, so I'd been forced to use the auction house.\n\nMoney in hand, I considered my options.\n\n*Should I stay here or move to Winston Village?*\n\nI could make serious profit staying put, crafting Jaffa Arrows. I'd planned to move for hunting grounds, but leveling wasn't urgent when item creation paid this well.\n\n*Maybe I should just stay and craft...*\n\nOne problem. Smith was gay.\n\n*If I'm alone with him...* \n\nThe thought made my skin crawl. Hunting could wait, but I'd be more comfortable in a village suited to my level. Winston it was.\n\nI approached the carriage station and put on my saddest face.\n\n\"My ailing sister is waiting in Winston Village...\"\n\n\"Oh no! Then I'll leave an hour early. Climb in!\"\n\n\"But I only have seven gold...\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought you had a reservation. Sorry.\"\n\nFirst negotiation: failed.\n\n\"My grandmother died the day I was born. Today's the anniversary. I need to reach Winston Village, but I only have seven gold and fifty silver...\"\n\nThe driver scratched his beard. \"I appreciate your high reputation and situation, but seven-fifty is too much of a loss for a Winston trip. Sorry.\"\n\nSecond negotiation: failed. Humans always stepped on other humans.\n\n\"You should be giving me a choco pie. We're all in this together!\"\n\nI ended up on the cheapest carriage available.\n\n\"Let's head to Winston. Should be quick and safe, considering what I paid. And be friendly! Show some hospitality.\"\n\n\"...I'd be grateful if you didn't talk.\"\n\nI settled into the seat. The carriage was bumpy. The driver was rude. My mood remained excellent.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**  \n**OG: Glossary Link.**  \n**Current schedule: 16 chapters a week.**\n\n**Check out my Patreon for early access to unedited chapters.
