I just want a child like Irene.* Someone bright, kind, beautiful. Everything he wasn't.\n\n*A son might turn out like me.*\n\nThe old wives' tale claimed daughters resembled fathers and sons resembled mothers. Grid didn't believe it. He refused to believe a girl would inherit his ugliness and failure.\n\n> [Do you really want a daughter?]\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n> [Okay. The baby who will be born soon will reflect your will.]\n\n\"Got it!\"\n\nGrid bolted from the smithy. His boots pounded against the cobblestones, taking the shortest route to the castle. His lungs burned. *Just a little faster. I need to see my child's face.*\n\n***\n\nLauel leaned against the castle gates. Dark circles hung beneath his eyes like bruises.\n\n\"You aren't late.\"\n\nGrid skidded to a halt, kicking up dust.\n\n\"The midwife went in thirty minutes ago.\" Lauel pushed off from the wall. \"The child could arrive any moment. Before that... you're really naming your kid Grene? Seriously?\" He rubbed his temples. \"Please. Reconsider.\"\n\nThey climbed the stairs to the third floor. Lauel's voice carried a desperate edge. The man juggled Reidan's administration, Bairan's development, Cork Island's operations—and in reality, screened the endless flood of guild applications.\n\n*Cry! Cry!*\n\nA newborn's wail echoed from Irene's bedroom at the end of the hall.\n\nThe maid burst through the door, her face flushed with excitement.\n\n\"Congratulations!\"\n\nGrid's chest tightened. *I'm a father.* The thought should have terrified him. Instead, joy swallowed the fear whole.\n\n\"A daughter!\" Grid reached for the doorframe.\n\nThe maid beamed at him. \"Your son!\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nThe words punched through him like a blade. His vision tunneled.\n\n*Son?*\n\nBehind him, Marquis Steim and his vassals erupted into celebration.\n\n\"A precious boy! A young gentleman born into our family!\"\n\n\"Congratulations, Duke Grid! Marquis Steim!\"\n\n\"Health and prosperity!\"\n\nGrid stood frozen in the hallway.\n\n*A son.*\n\nThe system had promised his choice would influence the child's gender. What was this, then?\n\n*Ah.* Understanding settled like cold iron in his gut. *I was always unlucky.*\n\nWhen had life ever bent to his will? Before becoming Pagma's Descendant, misfortune had stalked him like a shadow. The type of bad luck that made you wonder if you'd committed genocide in a past life.\n\nThis was reality.\n\nGrid exhaled slowly and pushed open the bedroom door.\n\n***\n\nIrene lay against the pillows, her face pale but radiant.\n\n\"Dear husband...\" She gazed at the bundle in her arms. \"A boy who resembles you. I'm so happy.\"\n\nSweat still clung to her forehead. Grid had never witnessed childbirth, but he could read the exhaustion carved into her features. Yet her smile outshone everything.\n\n*Maybe Irene's wish mattered more than my bad luck.*\n\nThe tension bled from his shoulders. What did it matter? Boy or girl, this was proof of their love. Besides...\n\n*We can always have another child if I want a daughter.*\n\nIrene wanted a large family. She'd told him she would bear as many children as her body allowed. \n\nGrid stepped forward and kissed her forehead. The salt of her sweat mixed with the herbal scent of the birthing room.\n\n\"You must've suffered. Thank you.\" He cupped her face. \"Thank you for this gift. Above all, I wish for you to be healthy.\"\n\n\"Dear husband...\"\n\nIrene's eyes glistened. She lifted the child toward him.\n\n\"Please hold him.\"\n\n\"I... um.\"\n\nGrid froze. The baby had black hair. *Just like mine.* His stomach knotted.\n\n*Please let his nature be different from mine.*\n\nHe reached out. His hands trembled as Irene placed the infant in his arms.\n\nThen his breath caught.\n\n*Why is he so beautiful?*\n\nNewborns were supposed to resemble wrinkled monkeys. They couldn't open their eyes for days. But this child... his skin was porcelain-smooth, and his eyes were already open. Blue eyes, like Irene's. They gleamed like cut sapphires.\n\nGrid's mouth stretched into a grin. The child was a perfect fusion of him and Irene. Affection surged through his chest, overwhelming.\n\n\"What is our grandchild's name?\"\n\nMarquis Steim's own smile could've split his face. He looked more delighted than Grid.\n\n\"The child's name...\"\n\nEvery eye in the room fixed on Grid. Lauel's stare carried desperate intensity.\n\n*Please don't say Grene. Anything but Grene.*\n\nGrid cleared his throat.\n\n\"Lord.\"\n\n*Don't be despised like me. Be loved and respected by all. Don't envy others like I did. Have a wide heart.* He'd packed every hope into those four letters.\n\nLauel's shoulders sagged with relief. The vassals nodded approvingly. A good, strong name.\n\nThen Grid's expression brightened further. \"Maybe I should add my initial at the front. G-lord.\"\n\nLauel's face twisted. \"Glord?!\" His voice cracked. \"That copies the naming format of an orc chief!\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nA decade of naming frustration lifted from Grid's chest. Glord. He'd crafted it using all his accumulated experience with names.\n\n\"Phew. It's cool.\"\n\nLauel jabbed a finger at him. \"Just name him Lord!\"\n\n\"Isn't that too common?\"\n\n\"It's better than copying an orc chief!\"\n\nGrid paused. The man had a point. Glord was a proper noun in Satisfy. Better to avoid it.\n\n\"Okay, I understand.\" He looked down at the baby. \"This child's name is Lord.\"\n\n> [Congratulations on the fruit of your love!]\n>\n> [You are the first user to become a father!]\n>\n> [The title <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">'First Father'</span> has been obtained.]\n\n> **[First Father]**\n>\n> * When in a party with your child, all stats increase by 8%.\n>\n> * If the child's health drops below 30%, the passive skill 'Father's Instinctive Love' activates: Movement Speed +80% for 20 seconds. All skill cooldowns reset immediately.\n\n*Cooldown reset?* Grid's eyes widened. That was massive. Then doubt crept in.\n\n*Wait. Party?*\n\nWhy would he take his infant child hunting?\n\n*What kind of system is this?*\n\nA new window materialized before him.\n\n> **Name:** Lord Steim  \n> **Age:** 0 years **Gender:** Male  \n> **Occupation:** Young Nobleman\n>\n> **Title:** <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Grid's Son</span>  \n> * The son of a legendary blacksmith.

Education will determine his fate.*\n\n\"This is completely...\"\n\n*A diamond spoon in Satisfy.*\n\nGrid stared at the status window, speechless.\n\nLord Steim. The day had come when the future overlord of the world, who would carry the Overgeared name to its zenith, was born.\n\n***\n\n\"Abu. Abu.\"\n\nA week had passed since Lord's birth. The child's beauty had already begun to bloom. He'd inherited Grid's eyes and the sharp line of his nose—the good parts. From Irene came his face shape, his porcelain skin, his rosebud lips, and those sapphire pupils.\n\n\"So pretty.\"\n\nSaintess Ruby had arrived in Reidan two days ago, desperate to meet her nephew. She'd barely left Lord's side since, cooing over him with the baby toys Grid had designed.\n\nThree other women occupied the far side of the nursery. Yura, Jishuka, and Sexy Schoolgirl stood clustered together, tension crackling between them like static.\n\nJishuka folded her arms. \"I'll admit the baby is pretty. But the child I give birth to will be better.\" She tossed her hair. \"Think about it. How dignified and sexy would a child from Grid and me be?\"\n\nSexy Schoolgirl's jaw dropped. \"Oh my~ Are you planning to marry Grid? In the game like Irene?\"\n\n\"Huhut. This child talks nonsense.\" Jishuka's smile turned predatory. \"If I marry Grid, it'll be in reality. You can play concubine in the game.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid I'll be sexier than you in a year or two?\" Sexy Schoolgirl stepped closer.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be more self-conscious?\"\n\n\"I don't have the emotions of a kid.\"\n\nYura moved between them. Her expression remained serene, unlike the other two.\n\n\"Yura, aren't you worried?\" Jishuka glanced at her. \"Irene and Grid will grow closer after Lord's birth. Our positions will shrink.\"\n\nYura's tone stayed flat. \"I'm already treated like a folding screen. There's nothing to worry about.\"\n\nSilence fell. Jishuka and Sexy Schoolgirl exchanged glances. *One of the world's most beautiful women, and Grid treats her like furniture?* Neither could wrap their heads around it.\n\nSehee laughed from her spot beside Lord's cradle.\n\n*It's because Oppa is shy.*\n\nEveryone forgot it since Grid was married, but he had zero romantic experience in reality. He'd never even held hands with a woman. Someone as impossibly beautiful and talented as Yura was too high a wall for his first love. Though maybe if Yura had a chest like Jishuka's...\n\n***\n\nAt the same time, across the training grounds, Grid examined a familiar soldier.\n\n\"It's really amazing.\"\n\nRoyman had reached Level 160 under Piaro and Asmophel's brutal guidance. Grid checked his stats with the Great Lord's Sword, and satisfaction warmed his chest.\n\nBeyond Reidan's walls, a massive army of 5,000 troops marched across the vast desert toward the city.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**  \n**OG: Glossary Link.**\n\nCurrent schedule: 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
