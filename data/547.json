  "content": "# Chapter: The Price of Power\n\n\"*Weeeeeek!*\"\n\nFood and shelter—the fundamental pillars of human existence, sources of comfort and pleasure. Without them, survival became a struggle. Humanity craved bigger homes, finer clothes, richer flavors.\n\nYet Grid had willingly sacrificed these comforts. His hunger for strength eclipsed his appetite for good food. Not that the choice came easily.\n\n\"*Cough! Cough!* Damn Idan! How does someone make beef sirloin taste like *shit*?\"\n\nIn the cramped bathroom of Idan's restaurant, Grid hunched over the toilet, tears streaming down his face, nose running. The aftermath of purging Idan's culinary abomination wracked his body. What made it worse was the complete absence of stat gains despite choking down that garbage. The world's cruel obsession with probability made him want to scream.\n\n\"But I'm the one who chose this path...\" He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, grimacing. \"The results might be shit, but I don't regret the choice.\"\n\nHard to look dignified while still dry-heaving over a toilet, but Grid held onto his pride. He'd maintained his patience and perseverance through countless setbacks until achieving the results he wanted. He understood now—not everyone possessed that kind of resolve.\n\n\"Well...\" He straightened, steadying himself against the wall. \"At least my empty stomach's been dealt with.\"\n\nHis stamina gauge had restored to normal.\n\n*Ptoo. Ptoo.*\n\nGrid spat into the sink, rinsed his mouth, and made his way directly to Pangea Castle. He collapsed onto the bed in his assigned quarters and logged out without ceremony.\n\n***\n\n\"*Ugh*... I can still taste it.\"\n\nShin Youngwoo's complexion remained pale as he emerged from the capsule. The phantom flavor of Idan's cooking lingered on his tongue like a curse.\n\n\"Something sweet should fix this.\"\n\nHe only gave up good food *in Satisfy*. In reality? He craved indulgence. A sweet potato latte—warm, velvety, sweet. The perfect reward after a morning jog, the kind of simple luxury that melted away fatigue. Such a purchase would've been unthinkable during his debt-ridden days, but now? Six thousand won meant nothing to Shin Youngwoo. He donated 3,300 won to Uni X monthly without hesitation, so why balk at a 6,000 won beverage?\n\nThink about it logically. Youngwoo had always been stingy with *others*, never himself. Otherwise, he wouldn't have dropped 800 million won on a car.\n\n\"Time to eat.\"\n\nYoungwoo stretched luxuriously in the garden before entering the elevator. He descended to the famous cafe chain occupying the first floor of his building.\n\n\"Welcome!\"\n\nThe panoramic cafe spread before him—a cozy space that rivaled any establishment in the city center. Natural light flooded through floor-to-ceiling windows. A cheerful employee greeted him with a bright smile as Youngwoo ordered his sweet potato latte. He settled into a sunny window seat, his expression softening.\n\n*The guild members' buildings will be finished soon.*\n\nSix high-rise structures rose beside his own building, currently under construction. Buildings owned by Yura, Jishuka, Pon, Huroi, and Vantner. The sight filled Youngwoo with warmth. His former debt-ridden self had transformed into a landlord, and his comrades thrived. His heart swelled with contentment large enough to fill the world.\n\nThe employee approached with his drink, her smile faltering as anxiety crept into her expression. \"I've seen the news. The Overgeared Guild is facing difficulties these days. Is everything alright?\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThe Overgeared Guild was struggling?\n\n*Aren't we doing fine?*\n\nYoungwoo blinked, speechless. The employee continued her explanation.\n\n\"I heard from players who belong to the Eternal Kingdom. Apparently, Bairan and Patrian are completely isolated by enemy forces. It's heartbreaking. I'd fight for Overgeared myself if my level were higher.\"\n\n\"...The *players*?\"\n\nRealization struck Youngwoo like a hammer.\n\n*That bastard Aslan issued quests to kill Overgeared members!*\n\nLauel had assured him that Overgeared could repel any attack even without Grid's presence. \"Grow strong in the East Continent and return,\" he'd said. At the time, Grid had nodded obediently.\n\n*I didn't account for player intervention.*\n\nStill an idiot.\n\n*Thud!*\n\nHe shot from his seat, halfway to the elevator before freezing. The cafe owner had just emerged with a delicious-looking complimentary cake.\n\n\"Thank you for the meal!\"\n\nCan't resist free food! Youngwoo snatched up the cake and dove into the elevator. He jabbed the penthouse button while fumbling for his phone.\n\n\"...No. He'll just tell me not to worry.\"\n\nHis first instinct was to contact Lauel. Instead, he changed his mind, pulling a business card from his wallet and dialing the number. The call connected on the receiver's dime. Why?\n\n\"Bunny Bunny? Uh, um... What is... turn on the translator in English?\"\n\nInternational call rates!\n\n***\n\n**Bairan.**\n\nThe small city adjacent to Winston had originally fallen under Marquis Steim's jurisdiction. After Grid achieved great merit in the north, it passed to Jishuka, then to Grid himself. Yura was determined to protect it. Bairan represented Jishuka's gift to Overgeared as a founding member.\n\nYura had brought only herself to Overgeared. Beyond that, she hadn't contributed much—merely assisting in the Tiramet raid. From Overgeared's perspective, wasn't she worthless?\n\n*I need to prove my value.*\n\nThis wasn't mere vanity, some one-dimensional desire to impress Grid. Contributing to the organization she belonged to was simply natural.\n\n*Step.*\n\nYura ascended the fortress wall. She pulled out a yellow hair tie and gathered her long black hair into a ponytail. The souls of thousands of enemy players watching her scattered to the wind. Slim limbs, a perfect face—Yura's proportions seemed so unrealistic they wondered if a god had sculpted her.\n\n\"Wow... Her face looks even smaller with her hair tied up.\"\n\n\"She's more beautiful than the NPCs. That's a *real* person?\"\n\n\"So pretty...\"\n\nExclamations erupted from various races. Skin whiter than fresh snowfall. Gleaming lips and eyes that charmed anyone who beheld them. Everyone present found themselves drawn to her beauty. Pon observed the enemies' reactions and chuckled.\n\n*They've lost their minds. Though I admire her beauty every time I see her too.*\n\nPon cared only about growing stronger in-game, but in reality, he was a man who couldn't live without female companionship. For him, Yura embodied the ideal woman. Yet he'd long since abandoned any pursuit. No point becoming Grid's romantic rival.\n\n\"According to the report, there are 10,000 enemies. Half are players.\"\n\nIn one sense, players being incorporated into the army was encouraging—the kingdom's military structure made infiltration with spies easier. Not that sneaking in Overgeared members was feasible, but Pon's moderate personality had cultivated a variety of contacts.\n\n\"Interesting numbers. The kingdom soldiers average level 180, while the players are around 140.\"\n\n\"Makes sense, considering most nearby hunting grounds cater to low and mid-level players. But I didn't expect the kingdom's soldiers to be *that* high-level.\"\n\n\"Agreed. The soldiers attacking Patrian only average level 160. Why send this superior army here instead?\"\n\n\"Bairan's closer to the capital than Patrian. From the kingdom's perspective, establishing a base here is more strategic.\"\n\n\"I see. *Tsk.* They wouldn't dare attack Bairan if Marquis Steim had sided with us. Doesn't he realize he became a marquis thanks to Grid?\"\n\n\"You must understand Marquis Steim's position. At his core, he's a loyal subject of Eternal. Even though the king killed his brother, betrayal doesn't come easily. Above all, war is terrifying. He fears his precious people will be swept away by it. I respect his heart.\"\n\nAs a former member of the Yatan Church, Yura was intimately familiar with slaughter. She'd earned the nickname Blood Witch by being perpetually soaked in enemy blood. But those days represented mere role-playing. Unlike Lauel, she didn't view people as disposable tools—she appreciated Marquis Steim's compassion. A man who cherished his people possessed genuine value.\n\n*A talented individual essential for Youngwoo's future kingdom.*\n\nThey would win this war without pressuring Marquis Steim. Yura pledged this to herself as she drew a sword. Yes, a *sword*—not a gun. Not a bayonet with an attached blade, but a pure sword measuring one meter in length. Pon tilted his head.\n\n\"A sword? Isn't a Demon Slayer's primary weapon a magic engineering gun?\"\n\n\"Swords can also serve as primary weapons. Demon Slayers possess equal levels of **Gun Mastery** and **Sword Mastery**.\"\n\nShe'd chosen guns initially because her predecessor had favored them. She'd believed guns superior to swords for Demon Slayers. The National Competition changed her thinking. She'd struggled in close combat since her black magician days. No more fear of approaching enemies.\n\nAdditionally, a crucial factor influenced her weapon choice: Grid. Grid couldn't craft guns alone—he required magical and alchemical assistance. Swords, however? Grid could forge those independently. Using a sword meant easier access to Grid-made weapons.\n\nThus, Yura chose the blade. An excellent decision.\n\nBlack magician turned warrior. She formulated and arranged magic with inhuman reaction speed, displaying devastating combat capabilities. Her real-time calculation ability combined with swordsmanship made her as deadly as rose thorns.\n\n\"Whenever my basic skill cooldowns reset, I'll open the gate and sortie.\"\n\n\"...*Huh?*\"\n\n\"The enemies barely exceed level 200. If I go out and kill 100 people per sortie, repeating this will secure victory.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nHer brain resembled Lauel's, while her personality mirrored Grid's. Pon felt confused by this insane tactic and attempted to dissuade her.\n\n\"No, this won't work no matter how strong you are. Your stamina's an issue, and the fortress—\"\n\nToo late. Yura had already vaulted over the wall, ordering the soldiers to open the gates.\n\n*Kiiiiiiik!*\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"They're opening the gates themselves?\"\n\n\"Are they *insane*?\"\n\nThe kingdom's soldiers and players laughed as Bairan's gate swung open. They fielded 10,000 troops against Bairan's 2,000. Bairan should be turtling up defensively, not throwing open their doors.\n\n\"Hahaha! Bairan? Can't fight so you're surrendering? *Keeok!*\"\n\nThey anticipated bloodless entry. Then the bodies of excited players began dissolving into grey light one by one.\n\n*Peeng!*\n\n*Peng! Pepepeng!*\n\nA grey festival erupted—pillars of grey light shooting skyward. Yura stood at the epicenter. Her expression remained unchanged as her demon-slaying sword claimed human lives. A grim reaper beautiful as a goddess.\n\n\"The female version of Kraugel?\"\n\nYura activated **Image Sublimation** amidst the bombardment of arrows and magic. Pon couldn't suppress this thought as he watched Yura weave through enemies like lightning given form. The former 5th-ranked user. A genius who'd achieved a legendary class.\n\n***\n\n\"Crazy... What *are* these people?\"\n\n**Patrian**, the fortified city.\n\nThe Eternal Kingdom's players blanched. Each time Jishuka loosed an arrow, dozens of allies perished. Hundreds of soldiers crashed against the shields of Vantner and Toban like waves against rocks. Whenever the Overgeared members entered the battlefield with Regas at the vanguard, the army suffered devastation. For ordinary, low-level users who struggled against even one or two soldiers, the Overgeared members were transcendent beings.\n\nThe war's second day. The high rankers who'd been quietly observing the Eternal soldiers and ordinary players falter now faced a crossroads. Should they lend their strength to the Eternal Kingdom and strike Overgeared as planned, or withdraw?\n\n*I'd have joined if the Eternal Kingdom showed more promise.*\n\n*The troop numbers are too low. I'm reluctant to commit.*\n\nAt Satisfy's launch, most players had chosen the Saharan Empire as their starting location. The empire's extensive infrastructure made enjoying the game easier. The Eternal Kingdom compared to the empire? A village tucked away in the continent's north.\n\nThird-rate awareness. In truth, the Eternal Kingdom's player population was small and its quality poor. The high rankers decided to abandon the battlefield.\n\n\"Reinforcements have arrived!\"\n\nA voice roared across the battlefield. Every head turned instinctively. The Eternal Kingdom's players regained their color.\n\nJeff, Ralph, and Bubat—masters of the former Seven Guilds—led their forces into the war. Bubat, renowned for devastating crowd control abilities and battlefield dominance, smiled with satisfaction.\n\n\"Can't miss an opportunity to mess with Grid.\"\n\nBubat wasn't an Eternal member and hadn't received any anti-Overgeared quests. But that didn't matter. Grid had humiliated him repeatedly at the National Competition and during the Reidan invasion. He dreamed only of revenge.\n\n\"Let's go! Wipe out Overgeared!\"\n\n\"*Waaahhhhhhhh!*\"\n\nThe powerful army's appearance bolstered morale exponentially. The high rankers noticed this shift and joined the offensive. Jishuka's beautiful face twisted into a scowl.\n\n\"The puppies became dogs.\"\n\nThis was dangerous."
