  "content": "\"...Fifty-eight gold. Each.\"\n\nThe training scarecrows available in the Facilities menu weren't cheap—military-grade equipment built to last indefinitely came with a price tag to match. Which made the report in Lauel's hands all the more baffling. Two hundred and nineteen scarecrows had vanished without a trace.\n\nNo. Not vanished. *Destroyed*. By Grid.\n\nLauel's hands began to tremble as realization struck him.\n\n'Why would he obliterate perfectly good equipment? Unless...' His eyes widened. 'He was supposed to forge a sword from Belial's Horn today.'\n\nThe pieces fell into place with sickening clarity.\n\n'It failed. The crafting attempt must have failed.'\n\nHow much stress would drive Grid to demolish national property? The weapon forged from a great demon's horn should have been extraordinary. If the result had been disappointing—or worse, if the materials had been destroyed entirely—\n\n'Right after facing Agnus, too.' Lauel's grip tightened on the papers. 'He'd already be on edge. And now this?'\n\nHe had to check on his friend.\n\nLauel pushed away from his desk, ignoring the mountain of paperwork that still demanded attention, and reached for his whisper function—\n\nThe door swung open without ceremony.\n\nPope Damian strode in wearing the insufferably bright expression he always had when thinking about Isabel.\n\nLauel suppressed a sigh. \"Your Holiness. Shouldn't you be preparing for the Vatican's festival?\"\n\n\"I wanted to confirm the Rebecca temples are operating properly.\" Damian's usual enthusiasm dimmed slightly. \"During the battle with Immortal, I noticed Grid lacked priestly support. Did the Saharan Empire poach our clergy?\"\n\n\"No.\" Lauel managed a reassuring smile despite his concern. \"Grid simply didn't anticipate Agnus' interference. He thought he had sufficient margin for error.\"\n\n\"Ah, good. There were rumors the Empire was attempting to recruit our priests. I'm relieved they were unfounded.\"\n\n*Not entirely*, Lauel thought grimly. The Empire's agents had been making approaches—which was why Faker had barely slept in weeks. The assassin spent his nights hunting spies before they could make contact with the priests. Though Faker had mentioned his level was rising faster than traditional monster hunting, and the King of Shadows himself, Kasim, had taken notice of his work.\n\nPerhaps something good would come of it after all.\n\n\"Sir? Lauel?\"\n\n\"Sorry.\" Lauel shook himself. \"I was considering something else.\"\n\n\"Your workload is still crushing, isn't it? At this rate, you'll go bald from stress.\" Damian's concern was genuine. \"You need more administrative support.\"\n\n\"We've been recruiting aggressively. The students trained by Sage Sticks are developing remarkably fast.\" Lauel waved off the concern. \"Actually, I was about to find Grid. I believe he's... struggling after a failed crafting attempt.\"\n\nDamian's face went pale. \"Grid *failed*? At blacksmithing?\"\n\n\"Unbelievable!\" The Pope's voice rose to near-hysteria. \"The legendary blacksmith—failed?!\"\n\n\"Keep your voice—\"\n\nToo late.\n\n\"WHAT?!\" Vantner's bellow echoed from the hallway before the man himself burst through the doorway. \"Grid failed to make an item?!\"\n\nThe tanker's voice carried like a battle horn, impossible to ignore. Within moments, curious faces crowded the corridor.\n\n\"God Grid made a *normal* weapon?\"\n\n\"No—he actually failed! The materials were destroyed!\"\n\n\"Has his blacksmithing skill degraded?\"\n\n\"Will he lose his legendary class?!\"\n\nThe rumors mutated with each retelling, spreading through Reinhardt like wildfire.\n\n\"It must be a penalty from the forced assimilation against Agnus!\"\n\n\"Maybe he's a legendary *magician* now instead of a blacksmith?\"\n\n\"Then he's not the Overgeared King anymore—he's the *Magic* King?\"\n\n\"How devastated must he be?!\"\n\nWithin minutes, half the guild was scouring Reinhardt, searching for their grief-stricken leader. Damian joined the hunt without hesitation.\n\n\"Found him!\" someone shouted from the training grounds.\n\nGrid stood amid a field of shattered scarecrow parts, looking vaguely guilty—probably worried about Lauel's inevitable lecture.\n\n\"Look at that expression!\"\n\n\"The rumors were true...\"\n\n\"Grid, are you alright?\"\n\nGrid blinked at the crowd of concerned faces. \"What's all this about?\"\n\nDamian rushed forward, clasping Grid's shoulders. \"Don't let a single failure define you! Even masters stumble occasionally! You'll succeed next time, I'm certain of it!\"\n\n\"...What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"You don't need to hide your pain.\" Damian struck his own chest dramatically. \"Hit me! I'm reinforced with defensive buffs—several times more durable than during the National Competition! Release your frustration!\"\n\nToban and Vantner stepped forward, chests puffed out.\n\n\"Hit us instead! Don't hold back!\"\n\n\"You must be stressed from the Agnus battle! Let it out!\"\n\nGrid paused, considering. He *had* wanted to test the sword's damage output. The weapon had cut through scarecrows like paper—he was curious about its performance against actual opponents.\n\nAnd now volunteers had presented themselves.\n\n\"Alright.\" Grid's expression brightened. \"Apply for a duel request. That way you won't lose experience.\"\n\n\"What's death to a tanker?\" Vantner grinned confidently.\n\n\"I can withstand anything you dish out.\" Damian nodded firmly. \"Don't worry about me—I'm *much* stronger than I was before.\"\n\n\"You won't regret this?\"\n\nGrid drew the Enlightenment Sword, still attached to Sword Ghost's handle. He selected Damian as his target.\n\nThe blade descended.\n\n*WHOOOOOM!*\n\nBlack flames erupted from the point of impact—\n\n\"TIME OUT!\" Damian's eyes bulged as he checked his HP. \"WAIT—let me apply for the duel first—!\"\n\n\"What if I refuse?\"\n\nGrid's grin widened as the weapon's hidden property registered: *Additional 50% damage to sacred beings*. The power exceeded even his expectations.\n\n\"STOP! PLEASE!\" Damian bolted, Grid pursuing with gleaming eyes. Even with all his buffs active, the Pope had zero confidence in surviving another blow.\n\n\"...\"\n\nVantner and Toban had already retreated several steps.\n\n\"...Did he just *make* that sword?\"\n\nThat day, as praise for Grid's newest creation spread across Satisfy's forums and communities, the Overgeared members gained a newfound appreciation for their king's craftsmanship.\n\nThe legend of Overgeared was evolving once more."
