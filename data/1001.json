Blunt. Devastating.\n\nEach line hammered home the nightmare unfolding in the north. Nearly a thousand Overgeared members saw the alert and immediately mobilized, rushing toward Bairan from every corner of the kingdom.\n\nIt made no difference.\n\nBairan—captured in half a day.\n\nThe city had once been part of Winston, but investments and steady development had transformed it into something greater than its parent territory. Geographic advantages, personal significance to Grid and the guild's founding members, abundant resources—all of these had made Bairan a priority. Piaro himself had spent months there establishing agricultural infrastructure, turning it into the kingdom's second most critical supply hub after Reidan.\n\nLauel had stationed eight thousand troops there precisely because he understood its importance. Twenty-five mid-to-high level Overgeared members led by Ibellin had been assigned to its defense.\n\nAll of it swept aside in *half a day*.\n\nThe empire's air force had exceeded every projection.\n\nLauel had known the air force represented one of the Saharan Empire's premier military assets. Five thousand griffons. Three hundred wyverns. The sight alone would break most armies. Systematic training and discipline transformed those terrifying creatures into something far worse—a cohesive war machine. Lauel had identified them as a primary threat years ago and studied Rigal's career trajectory obsessively.\n\nThe conclusion: only elite members could engage the air force effectively. So he'd poured enormous capital into anti-air infrastructure across the entire kingdom. Watchtowers, anti-air cannons, magic watchtowers, magic turrets—every facility upgraded to the maximum level 10 allowed by the administration system.\n\nWasted. All of it.\n\n*Dammit.*\n\nUnless the Overgeared Kingdom achieved empire status, no facility could exceed level 10. The kingdom possessed the best possible anti-air defenses available, and the imperial air force had rendered them completely irrelevant.\n\n*So I've just been feeding the company money this whole time?*\n\nSetting the continent's strongest air force—the *strongest*—against players felt like a scam. Grid cursed the S.A. Group, then immediately turned that anger inward.\n\n*No. This is on me.*\n\nLauel had warned him repeatedly about the air force's threat level. This wouldn't have happened if Grid had simply made his own cannons. He couldn't produce magic turrets, but anti-air cannons? Those were well within his capabilities. The power output would have far exceeded standard models.\n\nBut he'd been too busy. Or convinced himself he was.\n\nHe should have realized—when something earns the title of \"strongest on the continent,\" it's because it overwhelms existing defense systems. That's what makes it *strongest*. But Grid had fallen into the trap of thinking his time was better spent enhancing guild equipment than constructing fortifications.\n\nToo narrow. His thinking had been far too narrow.\n\n\"There's an urgent matter. I have to leave.\" Grid bowed respectfully to Chreshler. \"Thank you for everything. May we meet again under better circumstances.\"\n\n*-I am already dead. Bring Marie Rose or don't come back.*\n\nGrid pulled out a return scroll and crushed it.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nMarie Rose's evil influence saturated the cave, disrupting all teleportation magic within its radius. Cursing, Grid sprinted deeper into the tunnel system until he'd put enough distance between himself and the vampire duchess. He tried again—\n\nA face flashed through his mind.\n\n*Jude!*\n\nGrid's first knight. No dramatic backstory. No legendary heritage. Born in Winston with exceptional constitution and... severely limited intelligence. That simple description summed up everything about Jude's existence. Unlike Piaro, Asmophel, or Mercedes, Grid hadn't become deeply involved in Jude's personal narrative. The man's cognitive limitations made normal conversation nearly impossible.\n\nBut they'd spent considerable time together. Shared countless memories. Few words passed between them, yet they'd developed a connection that transcended language—understanding conveyed through glances and presence alone. Jude's raw power and growth potential paled in comparison to the other knights, but Grid valued and trusted him nonetheless.\n\nThe proof? Grid had assigned Bairan's security to Jude specifically.\n\nThat faith had become poison.\n\n\"**Knights Summoning!**\"\n\nJude was in danger. Might already be dying. The thought threatened to shatter Grid's composure entirely. Memories cascaded through his mind—Jude's simple smile, his unwavering loyalty, moments shared across their time together.\n\n[Please select a knight to summon.]\n\n\"**Jude!**\" The name tore from Grid's throat, echoing through the forest.\n\nHe needed Jude to appear. *Needed* him to be safe.\n\nBut the summons went unanswered.\n\n\"Jude...?\"\n\nGrid's movements grew increasingly frantic as he ran beyond Marie Rose's sphere of influence. The moment spatial magic became available again, he activated the return scroll and materialized in Reinhardt.\n\nHe needed to find Sticks. *Now*.\n\n---\n\nKhan's statue shattered across the cobblestones in dozens of fragments. Rigal methodically crushed each piece beneath his boot—the hammer, the arms, the feet, the legs. All of it ground to powder in front of the assembled crowd.\n\n\"Don't! *No!*\" Jude thrashed against his chains, blood sheeting down his body. Each fragment Rigal destroyed tore another sound of anguish from Jude's throat, his struggles intensifying until the chains cut deeper into his flesh.\n\n\"Don't?\" Rigal's lip curled. \"This is imperial territory now. I have an *obligation* to cleanse this city before presenting it to His Majesty. And you—the defeated—have *no* right to object.\"\n\nThe imperial air force served as the empire's vanguard in every major campaign. Rigal's role followed a proven formula: crush the enemy, shatter their morale, prepare the ground for the main force. He'd refined the process to an art form over decades of warfare.\n\nStep one: destroy their symbols.\n\nRigal ground the statue's shoulder beneath his heel, gaze shifting toward the granary on the distant ridge. The life, labor, and hope of Bairan's people, all concentrated in one vulnerable location.\n\n*Shame to burn it. But necessary.*\n\nIdeally, captured enemy supplies would replenish their own stores. But his air force operated with limited carrying capacity, especially with prisoners to transport. No guarantee they could hold this position until the main imperial army arrived—not this deep in Overgeared territory.\n\nDestruction, then.\n\nThe chained knight's struggles intensified, his entire body convulsing as he tried to break free. Rigal watched dispassionately. Then he raised his boot over the final intact piece of the statue.\n\nThe head. Khan's face, frozen in bronze.\n\n\"Soon enough, your king's head will rest under my boot just like this.\" Rigal's voice carried across the square. \"Abandon your foolish hope. Surrender to the empire. Those who submit now will be granted imperial citizenship—proper treatment, protection, freedom from enslavement. Don't waste His Majesty's mercy.\"\n\nHe pressed down. Khan's face cracked.\n\n\"*No*...!\"\n\n\"**No!**\"\n\nBlood vessels burst in Jude's eyes. Since his days as a common soldier in Winston, he'd never imagined a better life than what King Grid had given him. Grid had looked past his stupidity, had *valued* him despite his limitations, had granted him purpose and dignity.\n\nGrid was his benefactor.\n\nAnd Jude had to watch as Grid's legacy was desecrated?\n\n\"**I DON'T LIKE IIIIIT!**\" The roar ripped from Jude's throat, tears of blood streaming down his face. His thoughts were simple—too simple for complexity or doubt. *Destroy the enemy. Break these chains. Destroy the enemy.*\n\nUltimate will, stripped of all nuance. Pure. Absolute.\n\nIt consumed him.\n\nJude's wrist twisted against the unyielding metal. Twisted further. Then something *broke* with a wet crack—eight carpal bones and the metacarpals pulverized under pressure. His left hand flattened grotesquely, slipping through the narrow gap in the chains.\n\n\"What are you planning to do with a hand that can't even hold a fork?\" Rigal blinked in surprise at the display of raw determination.\n\n\"*Kuoong*...\" Jude forced his mangled hand through the gap and *gripped* the chains. Teeth clenched, muscles screaming, he *tore*.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShattered bones. Severed nerves. Yet still possessing functional strength?\n\n\"*Hah*...! Kuhahahat! **Magnificent!**\" Rigal's laugh boomed across the square. His desire to possess this warrior intensified. Few people in the entire empire could match such resilience.\n\nJude rose to his feet and locked eyes with Rigal. \"The foot. Remove it.\"\n\n\"Planning to join me?\"\n\nJude shook his head. \"Don't want. You. *Bad*.\"\n\n\"Then I'm afraid we're at an impasse.\" Rigal increased the pressure. Khan's face crumbled completely.\n\nThe scream Jude released barely sounded human. Then he *charged*.\n\nBlood streaming from countless wounds, left hand dangling uselessly, matted hair wild around his face—he looked less like a man and more like some primordial force given flesh.\n\n\"*Crazy bastard!*\"\n\nRigal's soldiers scattered, their discipline cracking. Shields rose instinctively between them and the blood-soaked apparition bearing down on their commander.\n\n\"Jude! **Run away!**\" The Overgeared members shouted desperately.\n\nJude ignored them. He had one thought. One purpose. Nothing else mattered.\n\n[The king you pledged loyalty to has summoned you.]\n\n[The miracle of the pledge manifests as spatial transference.]\n\n\"**OHHHHHH!**\"\n\nHe'd experienced this before—yanked naked from his bath to answer Grid's summons. The king had told him to check his condition before responding next time. So this time, Jude didn't respond immediately. He wasn't *thinking* about anything, really.\n\nOnly destroying Rigal.\n\nJude's massive fist rocketed toward Rigal's face. Almost connected—\n\nBut Rigal caught it mid-strike. The shockwave from the collision rippled outward. Level 390 Jude stood no realistic chance against someone like Rigal, who'd already exceeded level 439 over a year ago.\n\nUnder normal circumstances.\n\n\"I suppose I'll need to keep you *properly* confined.\" Rigal's fingers tightened around Jude's fist.\n\n\"...?!\"\n\nThen Jude's other hand—the shattered, mangled *left* hand—slammed into Rigal's mouth.\n\nCompletely unexpected. Rigal had no time to react. The blow landed cleanly.\n\nThe damage was negligible. But the *audacity*—\n\n\"I see... Taming a beast requires *discipline*.\" Rigal's expression darkened for the first time. He was a duke of the Saharan Empire, a representative of the emperor himself, one of the continent's peak powers. And this *creature* had just struck him twice.\n\nHis hand moved toward his whip.\n\nJude had tasted despair a thousand times throughout his life. But he'd never felt frustrated—his thoughts were too simple for such complexity. And now he *still* wasn't frustrated, because only one thought occupied his entire being.\n\n\"...?\"\n\nHalfway across the continent, Grid froze mid-stride.\n\n[Your knight Jude's skill 'I have no Idea (SS-)' has evolved into 'Frustration Raises a Man (SS)'!]\n\n[Your knight Jude has been empowered by the effect of 'Frustration Raises a Man (SS)'!]\n\nAdditional notifications cascaded across his vision.\n\n\"W-What?\" Grid's confusion was absolute.\n\nIn Bairan's main square, Jude swung his left hand again.\n\nThe mangled ruin of flesh and bone had somehow *regenerated*—fully restored. And the power, the *speed*—\n\nRigal couldn't catch it barehanded this time. His whip snapped up desperately to intercept.\n\n*'What?!'*\n\nRigal, his soldiers, the Overgeared members, the civilians, the international broadcast crews capturing everything—all of them stood frozen in shock.\n\nOnly Jude moved, his restored fists blurring forward without a single conscious thought behind them.\n\n---\n\n**[Real-time Portal Search Rankings - Multiple Countries]**\n\n1.
