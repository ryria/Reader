  "content": "A voice too soft to be heard.\n\nA body too frail to carry muscle.\n\nGasping for breath after walking mere steps.\n\nA heart too gentle to crush even an ant.\n\nPeople despised everything about him. Ignored by some, mocked by others—he lived drowning in guilt. *I'm wrong. I shouldn't exist. I'm nothing but a burden.*\n\nThen she appeared.\n\n\"You're not wrong.\"\n\nShe told him the truth he'd never heard. You're not slow—you're *careful*. You're not weak—you're simply *different*. You can't hurt that ant because you understand compassion and respect.\n\n\"You aren't the problem. The cruelty lies in everyone else.\"\n\nShe became his lighthouse. His only home. He found safety in her arms, and she shielded him from the world. Even when those animals humiliated her, she smiled and promised she was fine. A hundred times. A thousand times.\n\nNo—she must have been a *million* times more terrified, more wounded, but she...\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nToo slow. Again. His sluggish limbs couldn't stop her body from sailing through the window. His clumsy mouth couldn't form the apology she deserved—the one who suffered for his sake. \n\nLike that memory carved into his heart, the arrow had already pierced Euphemina's chest. As she collapsed, she looked exactly like his lover falling from that window.\n\n\"Ahh...!\"\n\nHe knew. *Knew* that reality and games were different. Death here was trivial—a temporary inconvenience, nothing like true death. They were fundamentally different.\n\nSo why—\n\nWhy was he...\n\n\"KUAAAAAK!\" \n\nAgnus's scream tore through the burning forest. Watching Euphemina crumple, he saw only his former lover's final moment. His mind shattered.\n\n\"Human... I will never forgive you.\" \n\nThe voice belonged to the one who'd fired that arrow—Beniyaru, the dark elf Agnus had been hunting so desperately.\n\n\"You...! *You!*\" \n\nHatred flooded Agnus's gaze as he locked onto Beniyaru. But in this moment, the blame turned inward. *Why do I keep making the same mistake? Why did I hesitate? Even knowing no one should sacrifice themselves for trash like me—why?*\n\nHe was a plague. No one should come near him.\n\n\"DIE!\" \n\nAgnus lunged like a feral beast. But his body betrayed him—weakened from consecutive battles against Marie Rose and Zibal, he moved like a novice. Beniyaru slipped past his clumsy strike and sent an arrow through his ribs.\n\n*Crack.*\n\nAgnus staggered forward, his pathetic body folding. Beniyaru's dagger flashed toward his face.\n\n\"Agnus!!\"\n\nHe ripped the blade from his forehead and snarled at Zibal. \"Get lost!\"\n\nHe wanted solitude. Needed it. No new connections. No more people to hurt. Only one goal remained—resurrect his old lover and atone with his miserable life.\n\nAs his vision bled crimson, a skill he'd always refused surfaced in his mind.\n\n**[Assimilation]**\n\n*Part of the ego of the 1st Great Demon, Baal, will descend into your body.*\n\n*Your class will convert to 'Great Demon' and control will transfer to Baal.*\n\n*Trigger Condition: Enter a new contract.*\n\n*Duration: 2 minutes*\n\n*Cooldown: Resets after taking 3,000 human lives.*\n\nHe'd rejected it before. Who in their right mind would surrender their body to another? Only fools and madmen. \n\nBut worse than that was the *contract* required for activation:\n\n*(Slaughter 100 humans every day for the rest of your life. Violate this contract and lose one level per day.)*\n\nKilling a hundred people daily wasn't sustainable. Strong opponents were scattered and rare. The only solution? Massacre the weak. Raze villages. Bombard newbie hunting grounds with death magic. Harvest lives like wheat.\n\nBut Agnus had never enjoyed tormenting the helpless. Especially children—harming innocents revolted him at a primal level. Not because he was particularly virtuous. Simply because he was *human*.\n\nThat had been the decisive factor. The reason he'd turned away from Assimilation.\n\nNow everything had changed.\n\nHis conscience had burned away with his sanity. He'd lost everything because of weakness. Even his last shred of dignity had been trampled into the dirt. The world owed him a debt of suffering.\n\nIn the most twisted way possible, Agnus awakened.\n\n\"BAAL!\"\n\n**[Assimilation has been activated.]**\n\n**[Baal, the Absolute Ruler of Hell, laughs with delight.]**\n\n—*Eung~? Agnus, what's this? I never thought you'd make this choice.*\n\n\"Spare me the commentary!\"\n\n—*Kukukuk, I'm not mocking you. I'm impressed. Well done. You rarely make the correct decision.*\n\n**[Part of Baal's ego enters your body.]**\n\nThe sky choked with clouds—crimson as fresh blood. Every plant in the forest rotted in seconds, earth blackening beneath. The foul air didn't discriminate; it poisoned the fallen Euphemina, Zibal, and Beniyaru alike. Each breath brought blood to their lips.\n\n\"What...\"\n\nEuphemina and Zibal stared at Agnus in confusion. Demonic energy engulfed his entire frame. His eyes—whites turned jet black, golden pupils burning like cold fire.\n\n\"Kukuk, kuhahahat!\"\n\nBaal's laughter erupted from Agnus's throat. The fragment of Baal's consciousness grabbed the horn sprouting from Agnus's forehead, tearing it free to wield as a blade.\n\nIn that same instant, Beniyaru collapsed. A gaping wound opened in her chest where Baal's horn had *already* pierced through.\n\n\"*Fallen?*\" Baal's voice dripped contempt as he stalked toward the crumpled elf. \"Can you truly call yourself fallen when you hide like vermin in the forest?\"\n\nHe seized Beniyaru's hair in a vicious grip, dragging her face close. \"Remember this, elf—timid as a boy in his first battle. The only duties of the fallen are *revenge, destruction,* and *chaos.*\"\n\n*WHAM!*\n\nHis fist connected. \"Not that you'll have the chance.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nBeniyaru convulsed under the beating, blood filling her bulging eyes until even Zibal had to look away from the horror.\n\nEuphemina, stunned from the critical strike to her heart, finally found her voice. \"Agnus, calm down! I'm *fine!*\"\n\n\"Hrmm.\"\n\nBaal's gaze slid to her. *Step. Step.* His smile could have lit up a room—if not for the fingertips morphing into daggers. \"Ah, you're the one who kept showing ridiculous kindness to my toy.\"\n\n\"Agnus...?\"\n\nThe dagger slid into Euphemina's delicate throat. Blue eyes dimmed. Her small body collapsed like a broken marionette in Baal's arms.\n\n\"My head's ringing from all this shouting. Calm yourself. I'm about to make your dream come true,\" Baal muttered to the consciousness trapped inside. He discarded Euphemina's graying corpse, then drove the blood-slicked dagger into Beniyaru still slumped against the tree.\n\nA black-gold hand caught his wrist. The dagger struck it, but three more hands materialized. Each one executed flawless sword techniques—Link, Kill, Pinnacle. Swordsmanship Baal recognized intimately from his previous contractor.\n\n\"Kuhahat! This is *fun!*\"\n\nExcitement flared as Baal registered the arrival. He blocked all three God Hands with his dagger while turning his face skyward.\n\nLightning descended.\n\n\"AGNUS!!\"\n\n\"Pagma's Descendant!\"\n\nThe Enlightenment Sword crashed against Baal's dagger, shockwave rippling outward. Through the curtain of white hair, Grid's eyes blazed with fury and hatred. \"Son of a bitch! What did you...! What did you do to Euphemina?!\"\n\nGrid had flown here at the World Tree's request—*save Beniyaru*. Instead, the first thing he witnessed was Euphemina's lonely death. His companion, killed while he'd been preoccupied elsewhere.\n\n\"Damn it!\" \n\nGrid swung again. This should be simple—Agnus was relatively weak in close combat. A transcendent player like Grid could overpower him easily.\n\nYet Agnus deflected every strike with that small dagger. Black flames and red lightning exploded between them, only to be extinguished by demonic energy.\n\n*'So strong?'*\n\nTime was fair. As Grid grew, others grew alongside him. He understood that. But this gap—it didn't make sense. Agnus hadn't even summoned his death knights or lich yet.\n\n\"Blackening!\"\n\nSome special skill? Like Bentao's Mockery? Grid channeled his demonic energy. Despite the rage consuming him, his mind remained sharp. Rescue Beniyaru, end this fight—those were the priorities.\n\n\"...?\"\n\nThe demonic energy from Blackening dissipated like smoke. The skill failed to activate.\n\nBaal grinned at Grid's confusion. \"How foolish, trying to wield demonic energy in *my* presence.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Hahat! You haven't realized? Unlike Pagma, you have a remarkably stupid side.\"\n\nWhat nonsense was this? Grid frowned, trying to parse the ridiculous babble—then noticed.\n\nPale skin. Extended fangs. Eyes with blackened whites. Agnus looked... different from usual. Almost like Grid's own Blackening state...\n\n**[Fighting energy has reached maximum!]**\n\n\"...!?\"\n\nAlready full? That was the fastest it had *ever* filled.\n\n\"Who are you?!\" Goosebumps rippled across Grid's skin. Cold sweat traced down his spine.\n\nBaal answered the question trembling in Grid's voice. \"I sit upon hell's throne.\"\n\n\"Watching the pretensions of gods and humans... such fine entertainment.\"\n\n\"Ah~ I'm quite free with my time.\"\n\nThat should suffice as explanation. How would Pagma's Descendant react to learning Baal's identity?\n\n\"Kukuk...?\" \n\nBaal waited for despair to paint Grid's features. Instead, he froze. Grid's expression hadn't changed. He didn't even look particularly surprised.\n\n*'He's not afraid of me...?'*\n\nGrid pressed, impatience bleeding through. \"So who are you?\"\n\n\"...\" \n\nBaal was monumental. The archetypal final boss heroes dreamed of conquering. He'd encountered countless champions, and they all shared one trait—*wisdom*, regardless of capability. The heroes of Baal's era matched his own intellect. Ten meanings could be exchanged in a single sentence. Sometimes, they even achieved a strange rapport.\n\n*'Yet why is this one...'*\n\nBaffled by the unexpected reaction, Baal stood motionless before shouting, \"You truly are Pagma's Descendant! More intelligent and despicable than any hero I've encountered. Exactly like Pagma.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"You immediately recognized I have no time left, so you're stalling... Huhu, a bit disappointing. I'll have to postpone evaluating your skills until next time.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n*What is this person rambling about?* Grid tilted his head in genuine confusion.\n\nThen Baal moved—so fast even Grid's transcendent senses barely tracked him—and materialized beside Beniyaru.\n\n\"Good. Just enough time to finish this task.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" \n\nGrid lunged through a sword dance. The four-fusion technique manifested instantly, threatening Baal's position.\n\nToo late. Baal had already snuffed out Beniyaru's remaining breath.\n\n\"Haha, until next time, then.\"\n\nGrid's blade plunged toward Baal's torso—\n\n**[Assimilation duration has ended.]**\n\nBaal's ego retreated to hell. Agnus regained control of his body, death looming before him. He reflexively reached for Bentao's Mockery, then stopped. Instead, he gathered Beniyaru's corpse into his inventory.\n\nThen Agnus turned to ash.\n\n\"If Beniyaru had to die anyway, what was the point...? Huh?\" \n\nGrid stood alone in the corrupted forest, words dying as he belatedly noticed Zibal.\n\nZibal regarded him with something like admiration. \"You truly are incredible.\"\n\n\"What? No, wait.\" Grid blinked. \"The grandmaster? Why is *he* here?\"\n\nWas this some Sleeping Beauty situation? What was Zikfrector doing unconscious in the woods? Grid clicked his tongue and reached for the grandmaster, only for Zibal to block him.\n\n\"Waking him won't work—I've tried. Your priority should be leaving before the Neo Red Knights arrive. You can't handle them alone.\"\n\n\"Right, I'll call Piaro.\"\n\n\"That unlucky bastard... Anyway, the grandmaster will seek you out when the time is right.\"\n\n\"Hmm... Are you working with the grandmaster?\"\n\n\"That's how it turned out.\"\n\n\"Good side to be on.\" Grid flashed a grin. The Red Knights were approaching—exhausted from their battle with the Yatan Church, by the look of them. \"Since you mention it, I'll withdraw for today. I'm busy.\"\n\nGrid produced a return scroll and ripped it without hesitation. Before meeting the World Tree again, he wanted to check Euphemina's status.\n\nAs Grid vanished, Zibal shook his head. \"What a terrifying guy...\"\n\nFragment or not, Grid had faced the 1st Great Demon Baal and remained utterly composed."
