  "content": "**Chapter: Alchemy's Promise**\n\n\"Really? As expected, options are where the real value lies.\"\n\nFor the past week, Grid had devoted himself to hunting in the jungle—the first gateway into the Ruins of the War God. The followers who lurked there stood no chance against his full entourage: Noe, Randy, Tiramet, the light elemental, and the Overgeared Skeletons. Randy proved especially effective. The doppelganger of the Mysterious Forest, capable of copying both appearance and skills, had evolved alongside Grid's own mastery of Pagma's Swordsmanship.\n\n\"Let's take a break.\"\n\nWhen his stamina gauge began flashing, Grid sat down and summoned Overgeared Corn. The unicorn checked his surroundings—confirming no women were present—then entered Sage Time. He began licking Grid's cheek with the resigned air of a prisoner forced to kiss an enemy warlord's boots.\n\nNoe cackled. \"Overgeared Corn is complaining that his master doesn't have a lover. A man who walks alone without a woman is the most pathetic and unsightly creature in the world.\"\n\nOvergeared Corn seemed relieved someone could finally hear his complaints.\n\nGrid snorted. \"I'm a married man. *You're* the solo one.\"\n\nOvergeared Corn gave up. He hung his head and wept silently. Grid stroked the unicorn's mane, then pulled out his portable furnace and anvil before focusing on an incoming whisper. He was contacting Chris.\n\n*—So who's the lucky winner?*\n\n*—Vantner.*\n\nDuring Grid's absence, Chris had launched a campaign throughout the guild: *Make Things for Yourself*. The goal was to keep the alchemy facility running at maximum capacity without draining the Overgeared Kingdom's treasury. The response had been enthusiastic. Hundreds of Overgeared members traveled to Reidan daily, providing materials and utilizing the Production system.\n\nSome used the Transformation system. Others tried their luck with the Option system—though only a select few, given the forty-eight-hour cooldown. Truth be told, even without the cooldown, usage would remain limited. Each item could only accept so many options, and there was always the risk of ruining a perfectly good piece of equipment by rolling something useless. Case in point: Iyarugt's infamous \"coolness\" option.\n\nBut today, someone had beaten the odds. Vantner had landed the coveted 'Add Skill' option on his main weapon—the best possible outcome. The entire Overgeared Guild erupted in celebration.\n\nAn ultimate success in standard alchemy raised the facility's experience by a mere 0.01%. A perfect transformation result increased it by 1%. But landing the best outcome in the option addition field? That was worth 5%.\n\n*—A skill attachment... I'm jealous.*\n\n*—I thought I was going to die watching him celebrate.*\n\nVantner was the lucky bastard. And knowing his personality, he'd lord it over everyone for the next several years, making their ears bleed with constant boasting. Grid grumbled internally, then smiled.\n\n*—Well, I'm glad the facility experience jumped so dramatically.*\n\n*—Right. You guarantee 1% every ten days, Grid. If this luck holds, the facility will level up faster than projected.*\n\nThe outlook was optimistic, and the campaign had dramatically reduced their financial strain. The only concern was the inevitable string of failures. In the worst case, guild members might lose their enthusiasm for alchemy, causing experience gains to stagnate.\n\n*—It's too much strain on the members. I'll arrange for increased national investment in alchemy, so distribute alchemy products to compensate them.*\n\n*—Understood.*\n\nChris was a top ranker. Among two billion players, his power ranked at the summit, and he possessed extensive experience managing a large guild. He commanded loyal subordinates, had the resources of a tycoon, and harbored genuine ambitions of founding his own kingdom. By any measure, his pride should be formidable.\n\nYet before Grid, Chris remained humble. He followed Grid's lead without question or resentment.\n\nWas it simply because Grid's power exceeded his own? No—humans weren't pack animals who submitted purely to strength. Chris followed Grid because he trusted him absolutely. As Grid matured, Chris had come to genuinely respect his attitude—the way Grid shed his arrogance and looked after those around him. Chris wanted nothing more than to stand at the summit alongside this man.\n\n\"Alright, let's continue.\"\n\nGrid intended to be the first player to reach level 400. He dismissed Overgeared Corn and rose to his feet. A follower burst from the bushes, charging with a bull-like rush reminiscent of Bubat's technique. The distance closed in an instant. Bushes and branches trembled in the follower's wake. Before Grid could blink, the follower's blade carved a lethal arc toward his throat.\n\nGrid didn't move. He didn't need to.\n\n*Kyak kyak! Kyakyakyak!*\n\n\"...!?\"\n\nThe Overgeared Skeletons danced and cackled, drawing the follower's attention. The weapon shifted from Grid's neck toward the skeletons—and instead struck Tiramet's chest. Blood sprayed, but the vampire didn't even flinch. Instead, he sneered and locked the follower in a crushing bear hug.\n\n\"Nyahahahat!\"\n\n\"Pagma's Sword Dance—Link!\"\n\nNoe's claws and Randy's swordsmanship tore the follower to shreds. Enraged, the follower shook off Tiramet and prepared to counterattack.\n\n*Flash!*\n\nThe light elemental temporarily blinded him. Grid's basic attacks slammed into the follower's exposed back. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine strikes... Alex's Quick Gloves tripled his attack speed, working in perfect synergy with his transcendent status.\n\nPreviously, Grid had maxed out at six basic attacks per second. Now he could deliver nine. And this was without any buffs. The follower collapsed with a strangled moan. Grid didn't even spare a glance as black flames consumed the body, reducing it to ash. Instead, he smiled at his companions. \"Excellent teamwork. Well done.\"\n\n\"Heh, no big deal. These low-level trash are ordinary food for hell's best demonic beast.\"\n\n\"Grid becoming stronger means Randy is stronger. I'm happy...\"\n\n*Kyak kyak! Kya kya kyak!*\n\n*Clack! Clack clack!*\n\n*Flash flash!*\n\nNoe, Randy, the light elemental, and the Overgeared Skeletons clearly basked in Grid's praise. Only Tiramet remained unresponsive. The true blood vampire still struggled to accept his reality as a human's pet. Every true blood vampire Grid had encountered so far possessed insufferable arrogance—he figured Tiramet needed time to adjust.\n\n*It'll be different once we've spent more time together.*\n\n*Clack clack! Clack clack clack!*\n\n\"Stop dancing,\" Grid scolded the Overgeared Skeletons before pressing deeper into the forest. He planned to hunt continuously until Ultimate Transformation's cooldown expired.\n\n***\n\nThe vampire cities and Galgunos Temple served as the Overgeared Guild's exclusive hunting grounds, each offering distinct advantages. The vampire cities spawned numerous enemies, perfect for raising skill proficiency. They also offered jackpot drops—vampire items and elixirs.\n\nGalgunos Temple, by contrast, guaranteed overwhelming experience despite fewer monsters and drops. High-level Overgeared members claimed the temple while low-to-mid level members farmed the vampire cities.\n\n\"God, I'm dying. This place is brutal. And Grid's actually hunting at the Ruins of the War God?\"\n\nInside Galgunos Temple, Peak Sword sheathed the beautiful Iyarugt and collapsed. He remained stunned. Knowing that Grid could solo the nightmarish Ruins of the War God... the gap between them felt like an unbridgeable chasm.\n\nVantner grinned. \"The ruins aren't a big deal for Grid. Hell, I'm moving my hunting grounds there too.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"I'm too strong now with that new skill on my weapon. This place bores me. Huhuhut.\"\n\n\"Don't guzzle a potion while bragging. You'll choke.\"\n\n\"Hum hum.\"\n\nIt *was* brutal. Galgunos Temple spawned followers with frightening frequency. Even with Peak Sword, Vantner, Pon, Regas, Jishuka, and the rest of the 10 meritorious retainers hunting together, the Overgeared members faced constant crises. Ibellin and Zednos—the strongest members after the ten—had each died three times over the past ten days. A single lapse in concentration meant death. The meritorious retainers had begun encouraging guild members to stick to the vampire cities.\n\n\"Ugh. We're critically short on buffers and healers.\"\n\nHealers presented a particular problem. Due to Satisfy's mechanics, acquiring healers meant hiring NPC priests from the Rebecca Church. But Galgunos Temple proved too dangerous for Rebecca's priests—they outright refused to enter. The healing drought within the Overgeared Guild had reached crisis levels.\n\nUntil now.\n\n\"Please add us to the party.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nThe 10 meritorious retainers were helping guild members hunt while blocking follower patrol routes. Exhausted from continuous combat, they nevertheless looked up. Only one person held the title of Saintess. Grid's sister Ruby appeared at the temple entrance alongside her friend and escort, Sexy Schoolgirl. The moment they joined the party, Ruby's wide-area heal completely restored every Overgeared member. Surprised cheers erupted.\n\n\"What are you two doing here?\"\n\nRuby and Sexy Schoolgirl had joined the Overgeared Guild during high school and were among the guild's few light users. Between their studies, their playtime remained minimal. Their low levels typically confined them to beginner hunting grounds. Occasionally they appeared in the vampire cities, but only occasionally. Why had they come to Galgunos Temple—one of the highest difficulty zones in the game? Had they gained that many levels?\n\nSexy Schoolgirl flashed a V sign at the stunned members. \"Former university student, newly transitioned to professional gamer.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe power of the Overgeared Guild... The players they'd hoped would become their greatest assets in the coming years were finally...\n\n\"YES!\" Vantner's roar captured the joy rippling through the Overgeared members. Everyone welcomed Ruby and Sexy Schoolgirl. The party's hunting speed quadrupled overnight.\n\n***\n\n\"Look! There he is!\"\n\n\"The farmer of the Overgeared Guild!\"\n\n\"The man who made the Seven Dukes—no, the *Five* Dukes of the empire bow their heads!\"\n\n\"Piaro!\"\n\nCrowds flocked to Reinhardt's granaries. Tens of thousands of tourists visited daily for one reason: to witness the legendary farmer Piaro. No one had forgotten the supreme warrior who'd humbled the empire's proud dukes. The sight of him wielding farming tools to crush Berith...\n\n\"Wow! Look! Piaro's digging up potatoes!\"\n\n\"Ah! Ahhh! His hand plow is so elegant...\"\n\nBright-eyed tourists gazed at Piaro with a mixture of envy and reverence. Piaro had become a hero and idol to all players—not just Grid and the Overgeared members.\n\nSome argued Piaro should be Satisfy's official mascot. Several Korean markets famous for rice production even created characters in Satisfy specifically to meet him. Rumors claimed Vietnam's prime minister—representing a country famous for rice noodles—had secretly started playing through a backdoor account, though this remained unconfirmed.\n\nAs someone responsible for both the military and food supply, Piaro was one of the Overgeared Kingdom's greatest powers. New players rarely got the chance to meet him.\n\n\"Huhuhut.\" Aura Master Hurent laughed while working the fields alongside Piaro. He felt thrilled knowing so many people admired his master.\n\nAdministrator Rabbit approached the humming Hurent. \"Over here.\"\n\n\"Hm? Ah, yes. What do you need?\"\n\n\"Take these.\"\n\n\"Aren't these rainbow potatoes?\" Hurent cocked his head. He couldn't understand why the administrator was handing him a cart loaded with dozens of potato sacks.\n\nRabbit explained to the puzzled Hurent, \"Take them to the tourists and sell them. We shouldn't waste this opportunity.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Sell the potatoes.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Potatoes grown by the legendary farmer Piaro can sell for five times the normal price... No, *ten* times. What are you standing around for? Get moving.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nOn that day...\n\n**[Title: Today I visited the Overgeared Kingdom and encountered Aura Master Hurent]**\n\n*He was selling potatoes...*\n\n*ㄴ afsij**'s comment: Next you'll tell me Huroi is reading a morals textbook.*\n\nPosts about Hurent sightings flooded community forums worldwide, though few believed them.\n\n***\n\nIn Titan, capital of the Saharan Empire...\n\n\"Don't resist. Accept it. Things will be easier for you.\"\n\nEdan sat before the captured dukes and withdrew the Yatan Essence. Irresistible demonic energy surged forth, corrupting and manipulating their minds.\n\nDark clouds gathered over the empire."
