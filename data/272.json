He turned the divine weapon over in his hands, calculating.\n\n*I should get something out of this, right?*\n\nHe'd sacrificed the <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Goddess' Essence</span> to save Isabel. Surely a little compensation wasn't unreasonable.\n\n*I'll melt down Lifael's Spear.*\n\nAdamantium. A god mineral. And he could obtain it for free.\n\n*Just a small portion. She won't even notice.*\n\nHis **Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship** skill had reached Level 6, granting him (Understanding of Gods' Weapons). His mastery of appraisal was absolute. According to his analysis, the spear's proportions were excessive. The length, the thickness... it was poorly suited for a woman's frame.\n\n*If I trim it down, it'll actually be better for Isabel.*\n\nThe rationalization complete, Grid threw the spear into the furnace without hesitation. This was Grid's essence distilled to its purest form. Greed. His obsession as a blacksmith to forge something greater, something legendary, consumed all rational thought. He was an addict confronting his drug of choice, beyond reason or restraint.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nThe hammer fell with machine precision. His hands moved faster than before, smoother, each strike measured and exact. The production skills he'd accumulated showed themselves in every motion. Under his touch, <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Lifael's Spear</span> grew shorter. Thinner.\n\nAn apprentice blacksmith dropped his tongs.\n\n\"Incredible...\"\n\nThe other smiths crowded closer, watching Grid reshape a divine weapon with the casual confidence of a god. Was this what it meant to forge at the legendary level?\n\nThree hours passed in a blur of heat and hammering. Grid stepped back, lowering his tools.\n\n\"Finished.\"\n\nThen his face collapsed.\n\n> [Incomplete Lifael's Spear has been created.]\n\nThe message materialized before his eyes. Grid's stomach dropped.\n\n> **[Incomplete Lifael's Spear]**\n> \n> The harmony designed by god is broken. This is a useless stick.\n\nHe stared at the system window, then at the misshapen weapon in his hands.\n\n\"...Of course it is.\"\n\nHow many times had Satisfy taught him this lesson? The game never gave easy rewards. Never.\n\nGrid exhaled slowly, defeated.\n\n\"Damn it.\"\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nHis hammer rose and fell again, this time in frantic damage control. Three more hours. He had to restore what he'd destroyed before Goddess Rebecca decided to smite him for desecrating a divine artifact.\n\n*Ttiring~*\n\nThe cheerful notification sound was almost mocking. Then Grid saw the message and froze.\n\n> [The result was terrible, but your vision and spirit to challenge reinterpreting a god's weapon is deserving of high praise. You are qualified to become a true legend.]\n\n> [One of Pagma's Descendant's hidden pieces 'Sealed Ability' has been acquired.]\n\n> [The skill 'Legendary Blacksmith's Reconstruction' has been acquired.]\n\n> **[Legendary Blacksmith's Reconstruction Lv. 1]**\n> \n> Reinterpret items with 100% understanding into a new form.\n> \n> The performance of the modified item will depend on your interpretation, skill, and intentions.\n> \n> * An item can only be reconstructed once.\n> * When the skill level increases, the number of reconstructions will increase by one.\n\n> [You have taken one step closer to becoming a true legend by opening the hidden piece 'Sealed Ability.' Skill cooldown time will be reduced by 10%.]\n\n> [Reputation throughout the continent will rise by +2,000.]\n\n> [You currently have 30,011 reputation throughout the continent. You can now use the Reputation Store.]\n\nGrid read the notifications twice. Three times. Then he clenched his fists and burst into laughter.\n\n\"The old saying is true!\" His voice echoed through the smithy. \"Virtue is rewarded! Kuhahahaha!\"\n\nIn Grid's mind, the narrative had already rewritten itself. He was a saint. A hero who'd selflessly restored a divine weapon despite his hardship. The original malicious intent, the greed, the attempted theft... all of it dissolved like morning mist. His brain, loyal and self-serving as its master, had already erased the evidence.\n\n***\n\nOGC Station held the distinction of being the world's first gaming specialty channel.\n\nDecades before virtual reality revolutionized the industry, OGC had established the foundation of esports culture. Now, with Satisfy dominating the global market, OGC reigned as one of the premier gaming broadcasters worldwide.\n\nThe director leaned back in his chair, addressing his planning team.\n\n\"We're doing a live broadcast of the pope candidates' speeches.\"\n\nSilence. Then the protests began.\n\nOne team member grimaced. \"Who's going to care about Rebecca Church internal politics? That's niche content at best.\"\n\n\"Speeches are static,\" another added. \"We'll bleed viewers. And good luck selling ad space for that.\"\n\n\"There's a PvP tournament in the Zik Principality at the same time slot,\" a third voice chimed in. \"That's proven content. Why not cover that instead?\"\n\n\"If we have to do the speeches, record it and cut a highlight reel for the news segment. Don't waste prime time.\"\n\nThe director waited for the dissent to die down. Then he clapped his hands once, sharp and commanding.\n\n\"A user is running for pope.\"\n\nThe room went silent.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You're joking.\"\n\nThe director smiled. \"Last year, the Rebecca Church had seventy-one million members. This year, they've crossed eighty million. By year's end, they're projected to hit ninety million. That's the fastest-growing institution in Satisfy.\"\n\nHe let that sink in.\n\n\"Now imagine. The master of this religion is a player. Not an NPC. A user.\"\n\nUnderstanding dawned on the team's faces.\n\n\"This isn't just a story. This is a scoop on the level of Grid's major incidents.\"\n\nThe energy in the room shifted instantly. One producer was already pulling up spreadsheets.\n\n\"Prime time slot, confirmed. I'll start the promotional campaign immediately.\"\n\n\"I'll contact potential sponsors.\"\n\n\"Ad sales team will want in on this early.\"\n\nThe director raised his hand, cutting through the sudden enthusiasm.\n\n\"No leaks. We don't share this information until we're live. I want exclusive coverage. The moment this hits social media, every broadcaster in the world will be scrambling for a piece. We stay quiet until the cameras are rolling.\"\n\nIn the age of instant information, secrecy was the most valuable commodity.\n\n\"The broadcast starts slow. Point-one percent rating, maybe less. But by the end?\" The director's grin widened. \"Fifteen percent minimum. The ad rates we'll command will break records. Now go. Prepare.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\n\"Time to work.\"\n\nWhat the director didn't know, what he couldn't have predicted, was that this broadcast would shatter every viewership record in OGC's history.\n\n***\n\nEarl Chirita cut an ostentatious figure as he stepped onto Vatican grounds.\n\nA mere decade ago, he'd been Viscount Chirita, an unremarkable noble lost in the Empire's vast political machinery. Then his son Pascal became the leader of the Judar Church, and everything changed. Twenty million followers meant twenty million reasons for the Imperial Court to pay attention. The promotion to Earl followed naturally.\n\nAnd now...\n\n\"Ah!\" The earl spread his arms, inhaling deeply. \"Even the air in the Vatican tastes of power!\"\n\nHis clothes screamed wealth. Gold thread, rare fabrics, jewels that caught the light with every movement. Nobles from across the continent gravitated toward him like moths to flame.\n\n\"Earl Chirita.\" A foreign diplomat bowed low. \"An honor.\"\n\n\"In a month, your son becomes His Holiness,\" another noble observed. \"You must be very proud.\"\n\n\"Duke Chirita has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?\"\n\nThe earl basked in the attention, his chest swelling. All this, because he'd been blessed with an ambitious son.\n\nPascal approached through the crowd, his expression measured and formal.\n\n\"Welcome, Earl Chirita.\"\n\n\"Ah, Sir Pascal.\" The earl's tone remained carefully neutral, appropriate for a public greeting. \"It's been too long.\"\n\nProtocol demanded distance. Pascal served the Church before family. But once they'd excused themselves to a private alcove, the formality dropped.\n\n\"Did you secure the Emperor's support?\" Pascal's voice was low, urgent.\n\n\"Yes. Five Black Knights. And one Red Knight.\"\n\nPascal's face tightened.\n\n*Only one Red Knight?*\n\nThe Red Knights were called the continent's strongest force. But Grid had obliterated Kamiyan with a single strike. One knight seemed... inadequate.\n\n\"Which number?\"\n\n\"The 19th.\"\n\nPascal's eyes widened. The anxiety drained from his features.\n\n*A knight ranked in the tens!*\n\nThe numbering system was absolute. The 30th knight equaled a hundred-man army. The 20th, a thousand. And the 10th tier? They could face five of the 20th knights simultaneously. The 19th knight wasn't just stronger than Kamiyan. He was dozens of times more lethal.\n\n*The Emperor truly values me.*\n\nPascal trembled with barely suppressed excitement.\n\nEarl Chirita studied his son's face. \"Why did you request military support in the first place?\"\n\nPascal's smile was cold and dismissive.\n\n\"A fly was bothering me.\"\n\nDays ago, Grid had seemed like an existential threat. A disaster that haunted Pascal's sleep. But now, with the 19th knight in play, Grid was reduced to an insect. An annoyance to be swatted away.\n\n*My hair will grow back soon.*\n\nPascal's hairline had receded dramatically in recent days, stress eating away at his scalp. But now, touching his exposed forehead, he smiled with genuine contentment.\n\n***\n\nGrid surveyed the crowded Vatican plaza and grimaced.\n\n*This is going to be a circus.*\n\nThe crowd was massive, bodies pressed shoulder to shoulder. And worse, broadcast equipment was everywhere. OGC Station cameras on tripods, boom microphones, lighting rigs. An announcer he recognized, Choi Hyeyoung, was rehearsing her introduction by the fountain.\n\n*Annoying.*\n\nPublic interest in the papal election had clearly exceeded his expectations. If anyone recognized him here, he'd be mobbed by reporters demanding interviews. To avoid that nightmare, Grid wore the <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Slaughterer's Mask</span> and <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Slaughterer's Eye Patch</span>. His face and nameplate were hidden.\n\n*Much better.*\n\nDamian approached, Isabel and Huroi flanking him. Grid pulled <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Lifael's Spear</span> from his inventory and handed it to the girl.\n\n\"The White Transformation seal is intact. It won't drain your health anymore.\"\n\nIsabel's eyes glistened, tears threatening to spill.\n\n\"Thank you. Thank you so much.\"\n\nTo her, Grid and Damian were angels sent by Goddess Rebecca herself. Saviors who'd pulled her from hell and given her a future.\n\nMeanwhile, Huroi exhaled in relief.\n\n*Thank the gods. I was terrified My Lord would try to harvest materials from a divine artifact and get cursed for his greed.*\n\nBut no. Grid had returned the spear untouched. Huroi's respect deepened.\n\n*He resisted temptation when faced with such a treasure. My Lord has matured beyond measure. His virtue knows no bounds.*\n\nHuroi gave Grid an enthusiastic thumbs up.\n\nGrid blinked behind his mask.\n\n*What's his problem?*\n\nSomewhere in the crowd, unseen eyes watched the masked figure intently.\n\n---\n\n**Current schedule: 20 chapters a week.**"
