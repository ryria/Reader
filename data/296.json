Health, mana, stamina—everything snapped back to full capacity. The change rippled through the party like a jolt of electricity.\n\nGrid rolled his shoulders and pushed himself upright. His wounds closed, flesh knitting together as raw energy flooded his system. He looked at the vampires circling the group.\n\n\"Thanks for waiting.\"\n\nThe third stats awakening hit different. Way different. The numbers weren't just higher. They were *absurd*. Even Grid blinked at the surge of power coursing through his limbs.\n\n*This is insane.*\n\nJjejeong! Jjejejeok!\n\nHe moved. The vampires barely had time to process what they were seeing. One moment Grid was dying. The next, he was among them, blue and jade light carving through flesh.\n\n\"What is this—Kyaack!\"\n\nTwenty vampires dropped. Just like that. Blood sprayed across the stone floor. Body parts scattered. The remaining undead stumbled back, eyes wide with something vampires rarely felt.\n\nFear.\n\n\"Oh my.\"\n\nA female vampire rose from where she'd been about to feed on Vantner. Her voice dripped with contempt. \"A mere mortal can't seem to grasp who we are. How unpleasant.\"\n\nLexi straightened, magic power crackling around her pale fingers. She was a True Blood, exceptional in blood magic and arcane manipulation.\n\n\"Give me a handful of blood.\" She thrust both hands forward. \"Blood Chain.\"\n\nPuhahahak!\n\nThe blood erupting from her palms split into dozens of crimson tendrils. They snaked through the air toward Grid, a wide-area binding spell nearly impossible to dodge at close range.\n\nNearly.\n\nGrid's enhanced agility and insight let him see the gaps. He slipped past the first two streams like smoke, then activated Revolve. His greatsword traced a half-moon arc, and the blood magic reversed direction mid-flight.\n\n\"Kyaaak!\"\n\nThe chains wrapped around Lexi instead, constricting with the force she'd intended for Grid. She screamed, caught in her own spell. Grid closed the distance before she could recover and drove Failure toward her chest.\n\nNo hesitation. No mercy.\n\nSeokeok!\n\nLexi's eyes went wide. Her mouth opened in shock rather than pain. \"You... you damaged me?\"\n\nShe stared down at the massive wound splitting her sternum. True Blood vampires had bodies harder than steel. This shouldn't be possible.\n\n\"Blood Shield!\"\n\nThe blood pouring from her chest crystallized into multiple floating barriers. She tried to create distance, shields forming a wall between them.\n\nUseless.\n\nJjeejeeeong!\n\nThe jade greatsword shattered each shield like glass. Grid flowed through the debris, activating Kill. The technique of Pagma's Swordsmanship locked onto Lexi's face with surgical precision.\n\n\"What is—\"\n\nLexi transformed into smoke, the desperate defense of a True Blood avoiding fatal damage.\n\nPuok!\n\nLifael's Spear shot past Grid's shoulder and punched through the smoke cloud. White light flared. Lexi's physical form snapped back into existence, her escape cancelled.\n\n\"Eek!\" She threw her arms up to protect her face.\n\nHer arms could tank steel weapons without a scratch. But Kill didn't care about normal durability calculations. The Doppelganger's Greatsword came down with the weight of legend behind it.\n\nPeeok!\n\nThe sound reminded Grid of a watermelon splitting.\n\nCrash!\n\nLexi's body crumpled. Even True Blood vampires with eternal life had one weakness. Remove the head, and nothing else mattered. She collapsed like a puppet with cut strings, dissolving into grey light.\n\n> [The True Blood vampire, Lexi has been destroyed.]\n> [56,901,500 experience has been acquired.]\n> [The Sixth Piece of ??? has been acquired.]\n> [An <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Intermediate Vampire's Ring</span> has been acquired.]\n\nGrid glanced at the mysterious fragment. *Same material as Iyarugt, probably. Still don't know what it does.*\n\nHe checked the ring instead.\n\n> [**<span class=\"rarity-unique\">Intermediate Vampire's Ring</span>**]\n> Rating: Unique\n> * During normal attacks, 10% of the damage done to the target will be restored to you as health.\n> * This effect is only invoked once every 12 seconds.\n> \n> A unique magic power dwells in the vampire's ring.\n> It greatly elevates the wearer's survival skills.\n> \n> User Restriction: Level 320 or higher.\n> Weight: 1\n\nBetter lifesteal than the Junior version. Shorter cooldown too. Grid slipped it on immediately. The effect didn't stack with his other vampire ring, but he hadn't expected it to.\n\n*Still worth hundreds of gold. Vampire items are rare as hell.*\n\nStep. Step.\n\nHe moved through the remaining vampires like he was taking a stroll, positioning himself between them and his party. Blood dripped from Failure's edge.\n\n\"Everyone take a break. You've earned it.\"\n\nThe Overgeared members stared at him in silence. Their expressions ranged from shock to disbelief. Grid had always been strong, but this was something else entirely.\n\n*Just from hitting level 300? How high are his stats now?*\n\nThe question hung unspoken in the air.\n\n\"This guyyy!\"\n\nEvery vampire's attention snapped to Grid. The aggro shift was instant and total. Two more True Bloods were mixed in with the common undead. The party tensed, but Grid felt nothing but satisfaction.\n\nThe prey was coming to him. How convenient. He'd reached the same point as Elfin Stone, hunting the hunters for entertainment.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship, Wave.\"\n\nKurururung!\n\nEnergy rippled outward in a devastating arc. The vampires shrieked as the technique tore through them. In that moment of agony, understanding dawned.\n\nHumans weren't a lesser species. Their potential exceeded even immortal undead. They weren't cattle to be farmed and ignored.\n\n***\n\nBlack magicians had it rough in solo play. Their specialization in debuff magic made them terrible at hunting alone. Most focused on party content, where their crowd control and damage amplification shined.\n\nBut parties preferred buffers over debuffers. Finding groups as a black magician was like pulling teeth. The class barely existed in the rankings.\n\nYura was the exception that proved the rule. Fifth on the unified rankings despite her class. A mythical figure. Genius among geniuses. Users across the world admired her, aspired to be her.\n\nAnd now she stood in Reidan's throne room.\n\nLauel studied the unexpected visitor. \"What brings someone like you to our city?\"\n\nHe couldn't quite keep the admiration out of his voice. What guy wouldn't have a crush on a world-class beauty who dominated the rankings? Yura smiled at him and the gathered Overgeared members, all of whom were staring like she'd descended from heaven.\n\n*So beautiful.* The thought crossed multiple minds simultaneously. *She probably contributes to world peace just by existing.*\n\n\"I want to join Overgeared.\" Yura's smile brightened. \"Grid already agreed, so please check with him.\"\n\nSilence. Then chaos.\n\n\"What?!\"\n\nOne of the top solo rankers, on par with Kraugel and Agnus, wanted to join their guild? The shock rippled through the room like a physical force, followed immediately by euphoria.\n\nLauel grinned. \"Welcome!\"\n\nYura thought his mannerisms reminded her of Grid. *They're becoming similar.*\n\nIf Lauel knew what she was thinking, he'd probably have an aneurysm. He liked Grid, genuinely respected him, but being *similar* to Grid was a terrifying prospect. Yet it was happening anyway. Proximity changed people.\n\n***\n\nThe battle ended. Bodies dissolved into grey light.\n\n\"Brilliant work,\" someone said.\n\n\"You were incredible, Grid.\"\n\n\"Kyah! Truly God Grid! Do you know God Grid?\"\n\n\"Are those the only English words you know?\"\n\nThe Overgeared members praised Grid, but the celebration was short-lived. Reality set in fast. Grid was stronger than expected, sure, but could he actually take down Elfin Stone?\n\nGrid cut through their worry. \"Don't waste energy on what-ifs. We have one hour until Elfin Stone spawns. We need to recover as much stamina as possible.\"\n\nHis condition was terrible. The party had supported him throughout the fight, but he'd still soloed nearly a hundred vampires. His body was covered in wounds. His equipment's durability sat in the red.\n\n*Can I fully recover before the boss arrives?*\n\nProbably not. But Grid had an ace up his sleeve.\n\n> [**Item Combination**]\n> Two items with a 100% understanding can be combined to enhance the performance.\n> The performance of the combined items will depend on the compatibility between the items.\n> \n> * The combination retention time is limited to two minutes. Once this time limit is over, the items will return to their original appearance. At this time, the durability of the items will decrease by 50. This is consumed on a fixed basis.\n> * The time it takes for the combination to occur will depend on the structure of the item.\n> \n> Skill Mana Cost: 1,000\n> Skill Cooldown Time: 6 hours.\n\nFailure plus Lifael's Spear. If he combined them and maximized their synergy...\n\n*It'll be a weapon strong enough to kill Elfin Stone.*\n\nProbably. The two-minute duration was tight. And the vague \"time it takes for combination\" clause worried him. How long would the fusion take? Seconds? Minutes?\n\n*I wish I could test it first.*\n\nNew skills always made him itch to experiment. But the cooldown was six hours. He needed it for the boss fight. Testing it now would be stupid.\n\n*It'll be fine. I've got good instincts.*\n\nGrid settled back and pulled out his repair tools. Less than an hour remained before Elfin Stone emerged from his coffin.\n\nTime to get ready."
