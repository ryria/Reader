Indoor and outdoor pools. Training rooms, exhibition halls, gymnasiums, and facilities most universities couldn't afford.\n\nThe founder, Kim Jeongsook, had built the school on a single philosophy: *An affluent environment is required to cultivate a great lady.*\n\nFifty years later, her vision had manifested. Girls across the nation competed for admission, drawn by the prestige, the facilities, and the manicured landscape. The Young Ladies High School's vast grounds had become its greatest asset.\n\n***\n\nFestival crowds choked the walkways.\n\nTwo men wove through the mass of bodies, their faces hidden beneath oversized sunglasses and surgical masks. Youngwoo scanned the grounds, Peak Sword at his side.\n\n\"I heard the rumors, but damn.\" Peak Sword craned his neck. \"Why is this place bigger than most colleges?\"\n\nYoungwoo had attended a local university. Small. Affordable. This high school dwarfed it by a factor of three.\n\nPeak Sword glanced at him. \"Your sister goes here. You've never seen the campus?\"\n\n\"I always waited at the front gate.\" Youngwoo's jaw tightened. \"First time inside.\"\n\n\"Makes sense. Wait, what the hell?\"\n\nPeak Sword stopped mid-stride. His body went rigid.\n\n\"Takoyaki? Okonomiyaki? Yakisoba?\" He pointed at the vendor stalls lining the path, each one displaying Japanese signboards. \"This isn't Japan! Why are Korean students selling Japanese food at a Korean festival?\"\n\nHis voice rose with each word. The crowd around them shifted, creating small pockets of space.\n\n\"Our ancestors suffered under Japanese occupation!\" Peak Sword clutched his chest. \"And their descendants have forgiven everything, accepted their culture so completely we can't tell the difference! Our tolerance is too great! We're too generous!\"\n\nYoungwoo clicked his tongue.\n\nPeak Sword, president of the Korean Patriotic Association, loved his country with a fervor that bordered on delusion. He saw kindness where most saw cultural erosion.\n\nYoungwoo didn't care whether the stalls sold Korean, Japanese, or Chinese food. His concern was singular.\n\n*Sehee.*\n\n*That bastard Kim Doohyun.*\n\nThe world star would use his fame, his charisma, to get close to his sister. Youngwoo had come to prevent it. But the crowd was the first obstacle. Bodies pressed together, creating a suffocating wall of flesh and noise. He'd need ten minutes to cover a hundred meters at this rate.\n\n*Did the fans show up because they heard Doohyun was coming?*\n\n\"Excuse me.\"\n\nA small voice cut through his thoughts.\n\nA student approached, her expression shy beneath a cooking hat. An apron covered her uniform. She was cute in the way most high school girls were cute, which meant Youngwoo's guard went up immediately.\n\n\"Yes?\" He softened his tone without meaning to, the sight of the schoolgirl triggering thoughts of Sehee.\n\nPeak Sword's skin crawled at the sudden change in his companion's demeanor.\n\nThe girl's smile widened. \"Our dessert club made a special treat for the festival. Would you like to try it? Only 3,000 won.\"\n\nShe waved her apron in what she probably thought was an enticing manner. Street vendor tactics. Club fundraising.\n\nYoungwoo hated spending money. But this girl might know Sehee. Might be her friend.\n\nHe nodded. \"Fine. One.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" The girl grabbed his sleeve, pulling him and Peak Sword toward her stall.\n\nThe menu board made Youngwoo's stomach turn.\n\n*Kimchi ice cream. Kimchi cake.*\n\nHis face drained of color. Peak Sword's eyes lit up like spotlights.\n\n\"Brilliant!\" Peak Sword clapped his hands. \"Making kimchi into dessert so foreigners can experience our culture! These kids understand global marketing!\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Youngwoo's voice was flat. \"Amazing.\"\n\n*Why force kimchi on foreigners? And why is kimchi the only thing we can think to represent Korea?*\n\nThe questions died in his throat as the schoolgirl's voice drifted over.\n\n\"See? I smiled and they followed.\" She spoke to another girl behind the counter, her tone smug. \"Easy targets. Schoolgirl simps.\"\n\nThe second girl giggled. \"Total suckers.\"\n\nYoungwoo's jaw clenched. He thought of Sehee. Swallowed his anger. Reached for the cups.\n\n\"8,000 won!\"\n\n\"You said 3,000.\"\n\n\"That's for one! Two costs 8,000!\"\n\nThe girl's smile remained plastered across her face.\n\n*Kids these days are terrifying.*\n\nYoungwoo sighed. His hand flicked out, his fingers tapping her forehead with more force than he'd intended.\n\n\"Act moderately, you brat.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nTears welled in the girl's eyes instantly.\n\n*Shit.*\n\nYoungwoo had a solid frame. Months of exercise had built real strength into his muscles. Controlling that strength was another matter entirely.\n\nThe girl's tears spilled over. Youngwoo's hand moved before his brain caught up, his fingers stroking her forehead to soothe the pain.\n\n\"Don't cry. Look, the price...\"\n\n\"Mmnh.\"\n\nThe sound that left the girl's throat was not the sound of pain relief.\n\nHer neck flushed red. Her ears. Her cheeks. Her legs trembled, and her eyes glazed over with something that made Youngwoo's blood run cold.\n\n*My dexterity stat.*\n\nThe months of crafting in Satisfy. The nights spent learning how to please Irene. His real-world body had absorbed those skills, translating thousands of hours of precise finger work into muscle memory that apparently worked on pressure points he hadn't meant to activate.\n\n*There's a time and place, and this isn't it!*\n\nHe yanked his hand back as if burned.\n\n\"Pay!\" Youngwoo barked at Peak Sword. \"Now!\"\n\n\"Huh? Oh, yes!\"\n\nPeak Sword fumbled with his wallet, confusion etched across his features. Youngwoo had wanted to buy the ice cream in the first place. What was the panic?\n\nHe handed over 8,000 won and jogged after Youngwoo, who was already pushing through the crowd.\n\nMinutes later.\n\n\"This is incredible!\" Peak Sword's eyes sparkled as he savored his ice cream. \"The sweet kimchi melts on the tongue! Foreigners will absolutely love this!\"\n\nYoungwoo thrust his untouched cup at him. \"Eat both.\"\n\nHe pulled out his phone instead. The text from Yerim, sent an hour ago, glowed on the screen.\n\n[At the festival, Sehee and I are working at a haunted house *^0^* I'm a sexy ♥ ghost]\n\nA photo was attached.\n\nYoungwoo's throat constricted.\n\nYerim wore a costume that revealed far too much. White thighs. A low neckline. The kind of outfit designed to appeal to teenage fantasies.\n\n*Virgin ghost. No male ghosts in sight.*\n\nIt was fine to look at. Objectively. But Sehee was dressed the same way, and that thought made his skin crawl. Kim Doohyun would see her. Would approach her.\n\nYoungwoo's hands clenched around his phone.\n\n*My dexterity.*\n\nThe realization struck him like lightning.\n\nHe'd crafted thousands of items in Satisfy. Trained his hands to execute precise movements, to find weak points, to apply pressure with surgical accuracy. He'd transferred those skills to real life, practicing on garlic cloves every night until his fingers could peel them in seconds.\n\n*It'll work. I've got the technique down.*\n\nUsing it on high school girls hadn't been part of the plan. But desperate times.\n\nYoungwoo cracked his knuckles. The sound was sharp in the festival noise.\n\nHe turned to Peak Sword. \"Follow me. Stay close.\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" Peak Sword looked up from his ice cream. \"How are you going to get through this mob?\"\n\nThe answer revealed itself immediately.\n\n\"Nnh!\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Kyaa!\"\n\nEvery time Youngwoo's hand brushed against a woman blocking their path, lightly touching her waist or the small of her back, the woman made a sound between a gasp and a moan before sinking to the ground.\n\nThe crowd parted.\n\nIt was biblical. Moses splitting the Red Sea. Women collapsed in his wake, creating a clear corridor through the festival grounds.\n\nPeak Sword's mouth hung open.\n\n*What is this sorcery?*\n\nThe principle eluded him, but the results were undeniable. God Grid was truly magnificent. Peak Sword jogged behind him, head held high with borrowed pride.\n\n***\n\nThe Young Ladies High School festival ran for three days. Ten thousand visitors per day on average. The event transcended the typical school festival, serving as an economic engine for the surrounding district. Media coverage was guaranteed. The school had mastered the art of intentional marketing.\n\nPrincipal Lee Cheongsun greeted Kim Doohyun with enthusiasm bordering on worship.\n\n\"I'm so pleased you agreed to attend our festival.\" Her smile was wide enough to show her molars. \"A world star of your caliber, and you're waiving your appearance fee? It's incredibly generous.\"\n\nEvery year, Lee Cheongsun spent a fortune bringing idols to the festival. Kim Doohyun's free appearance would earn her accolades from the board of directors. Her position would be secure for another term.\n\n\"It's nothing.\" Doohyun's attention was already elsewhere.\n\nHe scanned the festival schedule, his eyes skipping over everything except the Satisfy-related events.\n\nSatisfy Pet Contest.\n\nSatisfy Swimming Competition.\n\nSatisfy Fighting Competition.\n\nThe meeting concluded. Doohyun leaned forward.\n\n\"Did Grid agree to participate in any events?\"\n\nPrincipal Lee's expression soured. \"He declined. I sent him a personal request to attend, but he refused.\"\n\nDoohyun blinked.\n\n*Surprising.*\n\nIf he were Grid, he'd want to raise his sister's profile by attending events at her school. The rejection didn't fit the expected pattern.\n\n*Priorities must be separated. Grid's nature is perfectly suited to being Noe's master. I should learn from his discipline.*\n\nThe misunderstanding settled comfortably in Doohyun's mind.\n\n\"What about Ruby?\" He paused, correcting himself. \"I mean, Miss Sehee. Is she participating in anything?\"\n\n\"Here.\" Lee Cheongsun pointed at the schedule. \"The fighting competition.\"\n\nDoohyun's eyebrows rose.\n\n*Fighting competition?*\n\nHe'd expected the pet contest or the swimming competition. Combat was an unexpected choice. But it aligned with what he knew of Satisfy. Ruby was a Saintess class. Support role. Likely experimenting with different playstyles.\n\nThe path forward clarified. He'd approach Sehee naturally at the fighting competition. Build rapport. Eventually meet Grid through her.\n\nDoohyun nodded to himself. \"I'd like to participate in the fighting competition as well. And the pet contest.\"\n\nHe'd mentioned his love of Satisfy in several interviews. Playing with his dog. Gaming on his days off. Most people assumed it was just a hobby, a relatable quirk to humanize the world star image.\n\n*How cute will the pets in the contest be?*\n\nHis heart rate increased. Anticipation made his features sharper, more attractive.\n\nPrincipal Lee Cheongsun, sixty years old and a professional educator, felt her face warm."
