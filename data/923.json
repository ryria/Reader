  "content": "**\"The Operator is moving.\"**\n\nWithin S.A. Group headquarters, NPCs bore coded designations—a practical system. The alphanumeric sequences revealed function and purpose at a glance. Only a select few earned actual names instead of strings of letters and numbers. Those memorable enough, distinctive enough in personality to warrant the distinction. \n\nBut among even these exceptions, one stood apart.\n\n**S-001.** \n\nHanul.\n\nLike the Great Demon Baal and the Archangel Raphael, his domain was quest generation—but where Baal's episodes remained constrained by his contractor Agnus, Hanul operated without such limitations. He could weave narratives across countless players simultaneously, assigning roles and situations to an unlimited pool of participants.\n\nFive years since Satisfy's launch, the S.A. Group watched with eager anticipation as Hanul finally stirred into action. The analysts predicted his intervention would either breathe new life into storylines stagnating under the weight of players like Grid and Kraugel, or spawn entirely fresh narratives to invigorate the game world.\n\n***\n\n**[Call of the Heavens]**\n\n**[★Hidden Quest★**\n\n**Transcendent beings require your aid.**\n\n**Travel to Pangea, the starting city of the East Continent. Seek out the troubled inhabitants and hear their stories.**\n\n**Quest Clear Conditions: Arrive in Pangea within 3 days.**\n\n**Quest Clear Rewards:**\n\n**1. Unlock a linked hidden quest chain**\n\n**2. Unique-rated weapon production method (one-time consumable)**\n\n**Quest Failure Condition: None.]**\n\n\"What the—?\"\n\nAcross the continent, every blacksmith—regardless of level, skill proficiency, or stat distribution—received the identical quest window. No warning. No prerequisites. The phenomenon struck like lightning, and smithies everywhere erupted in celebration.\n\n\"These rewards are insane! I don't know what's happening, but this is a jackpot!\" \n\n\"My first hidden quest... How is this even possible?\"\n\n\"Every blacksmith got this? Wait—if we're getting class-specific quests, will other classes see these too?\"\n\n\"Doubt it. This has to be Grid's doing.\"\n\n\"Why bring up Grid?\"\n\n\"Are you dense? Remember when Grid received the Blacksmith God's blessing and every smith on the continent got buffed? This is probably an extension of that.\"\n\n\"Ah, right!\"\n\nGrid. Grid. Grid. The name spilled from lips without thought. Players who shared nothing but a class now shared in another man's good fortune. Free benefits. Unearned rewards.\n\n\"Having Grid as a fellow blacksmith is incredible... Absolutely incredible.\"\n\nProduction methods categorized by *rating* rather than specific item names were exceptionally rare. Such methods guaranteed results—create something, and it would match the designated tier without fail. This particular quest promised a unique-rated weapon, no strings attached. The kind of guaranteed outcome that made mouths water.\n\nUnique-rated equipment sold for tens to hundreds of millions of won depending on options, and the value held consistent whether the item required level 100, 200, or 300. In a game with two billion players, demand at every tier far exceeded supply.\n\n*I have to clear this quest!* \n\nThe goal unified smiths across the spectrum—from newcomers still grinding toward level 100 to established craftsmen on the rankings. \n\nBut one problem loomed: **How do you reach the East Continent?**\n\nThough traffic between continents had increased in recent years, fewer than ten thousand players had made the journey. Against a player base of two billion, that number was microscopic. For ordinary blacksmiths, crossing to the East Continent was effectively impossible, and as realization set in, curses echoed through cities and villages.\n\n\"Damn it! Why give us a quest we can't even complete?\"\n\n\"I got excited for nothing... Is someone mocking us?\"\n\nCommunity boards flooded with posts titled *\"Buying East Continent Travel Method\"* and *\"Will Pay Anything for Continental Portal.\"* None found sellers. Nobody was foolish enough to trade away access to an unconquered frontier.\n\n***\n\n*A hidden quest that isn't actually hidden...*\n\nPanmir, ranked first among blacksmiths, couldn't suppress his skepticism. When every smith received the same \"hidden\" quest simultaneously, it ceased being hidden. It felt like bait concealing a hook.\n\n*Can't be cleared anyway. No point dwelling on it.*\n\nHe closed the notification window and returned to work while chaos reigned around him.\n\n**Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!**\n\nHammer strikes rang across Reinhardt's smithy district, the pride of the Overgeared Kingdom. Thanks to the concentration of skilled blacksmiths, the kingdom's battle gear production now surpassed the continent's best, with mass-produced Grid Sets flowing to military units. The smithies formed the kingdom's beating heart, and the heat never died.\n\n\"Looking productive.\"\n\nGrid materialized among the forges.\n\n\"OHHH!\" \n\nCheers erupted. The legendary blacksmith acknowledged by divinity himself—their hero who'd elevated their entire class.\n\n\"Grid! Can you demonstrate your technique?\"\n\n\"I've been dying to meet you!\"\n\n\"You're even more handsome in person!\"\n\nGrid approached the clamoring smiths. \"Did you receive the hidden quest?\"\n\nPanmir stepped forward as their representative. \"Of course.\"\n\n\"Then why are you still here? Aren't you going to clear it?\"\n\nThe smiths stirred uneasily.\n\n\"We gave up. There's no way to get there.\"\n\n\"Grid, do you know how to reach the East Continent?\"\n\nThe questions piled up. Grid's expression darkened. \"This feels ominous.\"\n\nPanmir leaned close, voice dropping. \"I've lived long enough to know—nothing good comes without conditions. This quest has no entry requirements yet dangles incredible rewards. It smells like a trap.\"\n\nYears of experience speaking through an old man's caution. Grid nodded slowly. \"I understand your concern. You're right to be wary of sudden windfalls.\"\n\n\"Good that you—\"\n\n\"But are there truly no conditions? This quest *does* have a requirement: the blacksmith class.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"I've been to Pangea.\" Grid's tone shifted, conviction replacing doubt. \"Most residents followed me back and now live as Overgeared citizens. But not everyone came. Some stayed behind to protect that lonely city.\" He met Panmir's eyes. \"This quest is divine revelation to help them. The transcendent being mentioned—that's God Hexetia, who favors me. He's giving blacksmiths who serve him an opportunity: aid Pangea's suffering people and receive generous rewards. It's a form of divine patronage.\"\n\n\"That's... plausible.\" Panmir stroked his chin. \"Rebecca Church members who serve the Goddess often receive similar quests. But why Pangea specifically? What connects that city to Hexetia?\"\n\n\"Uh... honestly?\" Grid scratched his head. \"I'm not sure. Is there someone in Pangea who worships Hexetia?\" He paused. \"No, probably not. If there were, Hexetia wouldn't have been so... neglected.\"\n\n\"...Right.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll figure it out when we arrive.\" Grid couldn't shake his certainty that Hexetia lay behind this, so he chose optimism. Panmir's unease persisted, but Grid's reasoning held enough logic to be persuasive.\n\n\"Anyway,\" Panmir said, \"aren't unique-rated production methods useless to you? You don't need this.\"\n\n\"True.\" Grid surveyed the smiths gathered in the district—different countries, different genders, united by faith in him and their new home. He wanted to help them. Beyond altruism, if they produced more unique-rated items circulating through the Overgeared Kingdom, the nation's power would grow exponentially.\n\n\"Plus there's the linked quest...\"\n\n\"Right. More quests mean better rewards.\"\n\n\"Panmir, will you come?\"\n\n\"No. I'm staying.\"\n\n\"Why? Don't you want the rewards?\"\n\n\"Someone needs to lead them.\" Panmir gestured toward the smiths filling every forge, hammer strikes never ceasing. \"See those working themselves to exhaustion? They dream of becoming the third or fourth legend after Khan. That one, Latz—he only logs out twice daily and spends every other moment at his anvil.\"\n\n\"Talents who'll carry the Overgeared Kingdom's future.\"\n\n\"Yes. Also competitors threatening my ranking.\" Panmir smiled wryly. \"I'll stay and work beside them. Besides, jobs are piling up. Lauel will tear into us if too many people abandon their posts.\"\n\n\"I know. That's why I'm not taking everyone at once. We'll split into teams and rotate through. Work won't suffer.\" Grid fixed Panmir with a measured look. \"This quest only requires *arriving* in Pangea. With Sticks' help, we can be there in moments. Can't spare even that much time?\"\n\n\"The problem is the linked quest. If it triggers the instant we arrive, we might get stuck there. That would be regrettable.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. I'll prove with the first team that it's quick and safe.\" Grid turned toward the assembled crowd, thousands of expectant faces. \"The one hundred highest-level blacksmiths—you're coming with me to Pangea. Now.\"\n\nNo delays. Grid read from a pre-prepared list provided by his soldiers, then accepted an East Continent Movement Scroll from Sticks and raised it high.\n\n**Paaaat!**\n\nLight flared. Grid and one hundred blacksmiths vanished.\n\n***\n\n**[You have successfully traveled to the East Continent.]**\n\n**[You have arrived in Pangea.]**\n\n\"This is...\"\n\nThe blacksmiths barely processed the scroll's effect before reality shifted. When awareness returned, the landscape had transformed entirely. Curious eyes swept across their new surroundings.\n\nSilence gripped the city. Patterned tiles and grand symbols hinted at former prosperity, but human touch had abandoned these streets long ago. Weeds thrust through tile gaps in dense clusters. Rooftops sagged, damaged and neglected. \n\nOnce, this place thrived. Children played in alleys. Merchants shouted with vibrant voices. Carriages hauled goods while warriors hurried past.\n\nNow, only memory remained. The yangban threat drove people away. Unbearable external pressure transformed the city into a ghost town.\n\n**[★Hidden Quest★ 'Call of the Heavens' has been cleared.]**\n\nNotification windows populated their vision.\n\n**[Unique-rated weapon production method acquired as quest reward.]**\n\n**[Linked quest will trigger as quest reward.]**\n\n\"Yes!\" The blacksmiths celebrated. Briefly.\n\n**[East Continent Experience (1)]**\n\n**[★Hidden Quest★**\n\n**Creatures called 'Steel Jiangshi' roam this city. Prove you can survive these undead and adapt to the East Continent's harsh environment.**\n\n**Quest Clear Conditions: Survive for 1 hour.**\n\n**Quest Clear Rewards:**\n\n**1. Unlock a linked hidden quest**\n\n**2. Two unique-rated armor production methods (one-time consumables)**\n\n**Quest Failure: Level -1. Your highest stat permanently decreases by 10 points.]**\n\n\"Use the scroll! NOW!\"\n\nSomething was horribly wrong. Panmir's warning echoed in Grid's mind as he drew his sword. The confused blacksmiths knew nothing about jiangshi, but they obeyed instantly—fumbling for the West Continent Movement Scrolls Grid had distributed earlier.\n\nBut when they activated them...\n\n**[Cannot use this item during an active quest.]**\n\nThe scrolls refused to function. In that moment, shadows leaped between rooftops with the impossible spring of giant fleas.\n\n\"W-What is that...?\"\n\n\"No—AAAAGH!\"\n\nScreams erupted as the shadows closed distance. Pale skin stretched over blue-veined flesh. Bloodshot eyes bulged. Tongues lolled. **Jiangshi**—moving corpses sharing only conceptual similarity with zombies. These were faster, stronger, deadlier. They descended upon the blacksmiths like striking hawks.\n\n**\"Wave.\"**\n\nEnhanced Pagma's Swordsmanship unleashed devastating power. The technique obliterated jiangshi, reducing them to ash before they could land. The weakest undead couldn't withstand even a single strike from Grid's blade.\n\nAnd he was only beginning. Randy materialized alongside Noe and the Light Elemental. The Blade Aiming at the Gods floated into combat formation while Overgeared Skeletons clattered forward to form a defensive perimeter. Together, they shielded one hundred blacksmiths for a full hour without a single casualty.\n\n\"...\" \n\nThe blacksmiths stood speechless. They'd already revered Grid as the legendary smith blessed by divinity—the reason they'd immigrated to the Overgeared Kingdom. Now they witnessed his prowess as a *warrior*, and awe struck them anew.\n\n**[★Hidden Quest★ 'East Continent Experience (1)' has been cleared.]**\n\n**[Two unique-rated armor production methods acquired as quest reward.]**\n\nRelief washed through the group. Meanwhile, Grid's thoughts raced. *Isn't this too generous?*\n\nThe forced quest carried harsh penalties and genuine danger, yet the rewards were staggering. Three unique-rated production methods in one hour. While these mattered less to Grid personally, anticipation built for whatever the quest chain held further down the line.\n\nThe blacksmiths trembled. \"S-Scroll...\"\n\nThey wondered if they could escape before the next quest triggered. Too late.\n\n**[East Continent Experience (2)]**\n\n**[★Hidden Quest★**\n\n**Pangea's few remaining inhabitants are surrounded by 'Poison Jiangshi.' Find and rescue them. Beware of Steel Jiangshi attacks.**\n\n**Quest Clear Conditions: Rescue 30 people within 1 hour.**\n\n**Quest Clear Rewards:**\n\n**1. Unlock a linked hidden quest**\n\n**2. 10 Blessed Weapon Enhancement Stones**\n\n**Quest Failure: Level -1. Your highest stat permanently decreases by 15 points.]**\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nBlessed enhancement stones still commanded astronomical prices. Boss raids dropped only tiny quantities, making them desperately scarce. Yet the Overgeared Kingdom now had a path to one thousand blessed weapon enhancement stones.\n\nSimultaneously, at S.A. Group headquarters...\n\n\"Hanul's trials multiply difficulty while offering proportionally greater rewards...\"\n\nReasonable compensation for the world of Satisfy. Lim Cheolho's pulse quickened as he studied the monitor. \"This might birth the strongest demon king in National Competition history...\"\n\nThe Demon King Subjugation event was designed to guarantee the demon king's defeat. Even if only one participant breached the Four Heavenly Kings' gates and entered the demon king's castle, all fallen participants would resurrect. The demon king faced approximately four hundred National Competition participants in the finale. Meant to electrify audiences, victory was deemed physically impossible for the demon king.\n\nS.A. Group analysts predicted Grid would claim three, perhaps four medals this National Competition. \n\nBut now...\n\n\"Seven.\" Lim Cheolho's assessment shifted entirely."
