  "content": "# Chapter 337\n\nHurent had been playing Satisfy since the closed beta. Years of adventures had taught him one thing: the world was vast beyond measure. A farmer stronger than him? He could accept that.\n\nA legendary farmer wielding meteor-class magic? Entirely plausible.\n\n*The legendary fisherman is probably drinking tea with the dragon king by now.*\n\nHermits dotted the continent like scattered seeds. But one fact gnawed at Hurent's mind, refusing to settle. A legendary farmer existed. Fine. Then why did he serve Grid?\n\n*Grid, where does your strength end?*\n\nFirst legendary class. First to secure a legendary NPC. Hurent hated him. But hatred didn't erase the gulf between their accomplishments.\n\nPiaro extended a hand toward the broken warrior.\n\n\"Come with me.\"\n\nHurent stared at the farmer's face. No remorse flickered in those eyes. Thousands dead, and the man hadn't blinked once. The urge to resist rose in Hurent's chest, but his body refused to cooperate. His health bar mocked him from the corner of his vision.\n\nHe exhaled slowly. \"Yes, I'll follow. Drag me to Grid. Boil me, bake me, whatever brings you joy.\"\n\n\"No.\" Piaro's tone flattened. \"You will farm with me.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThe word hung in the air between them.\n\n*Is he actually insane?*\n\nHurent bit back a bitter laugh. He'd led an army against Reidan. From their perspective, he was a treasure trove of intelligence, a high-value prisoner worth interrogating carefully.\n\nAnd this lunatic wanted him to *farm*?\n\nThe absurdity stung worse than any wound. Piaro read the confusion on his face and made a dismissive sound in his throat.\n\n\"The leader of an army who died before reaching Reidan has no value.\" The farmer's gaze was flat, clinical. \"You just have to think about farming.\"\n\n\"Eek!\" The words escaped Hurent before he could stop them.\n\nPanic flooded his thoughts. His mouth moved faster than his judgment.\n\n\"I have confidential information! Critical intelligence! If you don't extract it from me, Reidan will burn!\" His voice pitched higher. \"So treat me as a high-priority prisoner!\"\n\n\"Oh, really?\"\n\nThe shift in Piaro's expression was immediate. The farmer's mask cracked. In its place stood the Commander of Reidan, cold and calculating.\n\nHurent's stomach dropped.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\n***\n\n\"Kuheok! Cough! Cough!\"\n\nThe wheat field detonated.\n\nMore than half of the 2,000 soldiers died instantly. The survivors crawled through the ash and blood, bodies shredded by wooden shrapnel. Bunny Bunny sprawled among them, his health bar screaming red at 15%. Unknown terror gripped his chest like a vice.\n\n*That's not a man. That's a walking disaster.*\n\nReidan's mad farmer. The rumors had undersold it. Overwhelmed Zibal. Turned Chris into a laborer. Held off seven guilds alone.\n\n*Every word was true.*\n\nBunny Bunny's camera feed was still recording. Gold. Pure gold. But gold meant nothing if he died here.\n\n*How did Zibal survive fighting that thing?*\n\nThe world was vast. Full of monsters. He wanted to capture them all, monetize every jaw-dropping moment, build an empire of viewers.\n\nBut first, he needed to not die.\n\nHe'd invested every stat point into Agility for situations exactly like this. Speed was survival. Speed was content.\n\n*First priority: escape.*\n\nHe had the footage. Farmer manifests wheat field from nothing. Farmer uses wheat field as area-of-effect explosive. Farmer obliterates an army.\n\nNo reason to stay. His original plan? Follow Hurent's revenge quest against Grid.\n\nPuk!\n\n\"Heok!\"\n\nBunny Bunny watched the hand plow strike Hurent's forehead.\n\nPuk!\n\n\"Kuack!\"\n\nA second strike. Blood trickled down Hurent's face.\n\nPuk!\n\n\"Kuheeok!\"\n\nThird strike. Hurent sagged like a puppet with cut strings.\n\n\"...\"\n\nBunny Bunny stared.\n\n*Hurent's revenge is fucking dead.*\n\nNew plan. Bunny Bunny equipped his Fast Boots, feeling the Agility buff surge through his legs. He turned and ran.\n\nPrince Ren had talent. Multiple talents. Better than Hurent. If he could film their clash with Overgeared...\n\n*I'll be drowning in money! Today's footage is worth 100 billion won, easy!*\n\nHis aspirations burned bright as he vanished into the desert.\n\n***\n\nGrid looked up from Lord's toys. \"Where did everyone go? The guild hall feels empty.\"\n\nHe'd stopped by Lauel's office before heading to the smithy. As always, paperwork consumed the desk like a growing tumor.\n\nLauel didn't glance up from his documents. \"Everybody's busy. Missions or hunting. They're not sitting idle.\"\n\n\"Still grinding the vampire cities?\"\n\n\"Most efficient method.\" Lauel shuffled papers. \"Experience, item drops, elixirs. The desert ecosystem is stable enough to support it.\"\n\n\"Anyone find an elixir yet?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Grid's shoulders slumped.\n\nThe drop rate was criminal. He'd been eyeing the Agility elixir for weeks.\n\nLauel set down his pen. \"Do you remember the vampire expedition? Ten years ago, the former lord sent an army to clear the cities.\"\n\n\"I remember.\" Grid frowned. \"Why bring it up now?\"\n\n\"Because it's bothering me.\" Lauel tapped the desk. \"The Overgeared members have explored seven cities. No traces of the expedition. Nothing.\"\n\nGrid shrugged. \"It was ten years ago. Time erases evidence.\"\n\n\"Normally, yes.\" Lauel's eyes narrowed. \"But the records state 18,000 people went on that expedition. That many bodies don't just vanish.\"\n\n\"We haven't checked all the cities yet. Maybe the evidence is in one of those.\"\n\nGrid paused. \"Is this actually important?\"\n\n\"At the present time, no.\"\n\n\"At the present time?\" Grid leaned forward. \"So it could become important later?\"\n\nBefore Lauel could answer, the office door slammed open.\n\n\"Earl Lauel!\"\n\nA young knight burst in without knocking. Blood soaked his armor. Wounds covered every visible inch of skin.\n\nLauel's expression hardened. The knight was gasping, dying on his feet, and etiquette suddenly seemed irrelevant.\n\n\"Aren't you one of Marquis Steim's knights?\" Lauel stood. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"Well... Heok!\" The knight's eyes landed on Grid.\n\nHis face went white. \"I-I greet Duke Grid!\"\n\nGrid waved a hand. \"Skip the formalities. Report.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" The knight straightened despite his wounds. \"5,000 enemy troops advancing on Reidan!\"\n\n\"5,000?\" Grid's voice went flat.\n\nDespair twisted the knight's face. \"Royal troops!\"\n\n\"Royal troops?\" Grid stood slowly. \"From Eternal?\"\n\n\"Yes! Sir Laden leads 1,000 northern soldiers to delay them, but...\" The knight's voice cracked. \"It's a terrible situation!\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\nGrid couldn't process it. \"Why would the Eternal Kingdom's royal army invade Reidan? We're allies.\"\n\nLauel smiled, but no warmth reached his eyes. \"The rice we planted has been harvested.\"\n\n\"Planted rice...?\"\n\nGrid's mind raced. Nine months in reality. Twenty-seven months in Satisfy. He'd learned. He'd grown.\n\nThe pieces clicked together.\n\n\"Did King Wiesbaden die?\"\n\n\"...!\"\n\nLauel's eyes widened. For a long moment, he stood frozen.\n\n*He figured it out himself. Grid actually reasoned through it.*\n\nLauel felt a swell of pride. \"This situation is interesting.\"\n\nGrid rose from the couch. A dark smile crossed his face.\n\n\"Lauel, have Asmophel muster the soldiers.\" His eyes gleamed. \"It's time for the storm.\"\n\nGrid turned toward his private warehouse. Row after row of Mass Production Grid Sets waited in the darkness.\n\n***\n\n\"Kuaack!\"\n\n\"M-Marquis Steim... I couldn't... hold them... I'm sorry...\" Blood bubbled from the soldier's lips. \"Cough! Cough!\"\n\nLaden's force of 1,000 troops and 10 knights had shattered the Iron Wind cavalry. Victory had lasted mere minutes before the second wave hit. Great Swordsman Chucksley's unit had caught them in the open desert.\n\n\"You're exceptional.\"\n\nChucksley lowered his blade. Great Swordsman. A title that placed him equal to the empire's former Piaro.\n\nHe studied Laden with something approaching respect. \"Twenty years. No... you might have reached my level in ten. I've never seen talent like yours.\"\n\n\"Pant... Pant...\"\n\nLaden had fought Beida and multiple elite opponents alone. Exhaustion weighed on him like iron chains. Facing Chucksley in this state was suicide.\n\nHe should have collapsed by now. But Laden kept his feet. The moment he fell, the 1,000 soldiers he treasured would be slaughtered.\n\n*I have to give everything for My Lord.*\n\nDisappointment and despair coiled in his chest. He'd failed.\n\nLaden tightened his grip on his sword. Blood filled his mouth. He smiled through it.\n\n\"Are you sure? I don't need ten years.\" His voice was ragged. \"Five years. No... I'll surpass you in three.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nChucksley's face twisted. He wanted to deny it. The words wouldn't come.\n\n\"Only if you survive.\"\n\n\"...That's right.\"\n\n\"Then try to survive.\"\n\nChucksley's family had served the royal family for generations. To him, Marquis Steim was a threat. A rival power that could challenge the throne. Worse now that Duke Grid had married into the family.\n\nBut today was opportunity. Catch both Marquis Steim and Duke Grid in one stroke. Meeting the northern troops by chance in the desert? Fortune smiled on loyalty.\n\nEvidence that Marquis Steim was in Reidan.\n\nChaaeng!\n\n\"Ugh!\"\n\nChucksley's swordsmanship was textbook perfect. Every movement efficient, precise, flawless. No wasted energy. No openings. A wall of technique that Laden's raw talent couldn't overcome.\n\nChaaeng! Chaeng!\n\nPuok!\n\n\"Kuaaaak!\"\n\nEach exchange left Laden bloodier. Each exchange sharpened Chucksley's edge. The northern army and the Black unit stood separated, watching their champions duel.\n\n*We won.*\n\n*It's over.*\n\nThe Black unit allowed themselves to relax. The northern troops felt their hope drain.\n\nMovement on the horizon.\n\n5,000 soldiers appeared like a mirage, ranks spreading across the desert. For one heartbeat, Laden's chest surged with hope.\n\nReinforcements?\n\nNo.\n\nThe banners identified them immediately. Prince Ren's main force.\n\nThe enemy.\n\nTears cut lines through the blood and dirt on Laden's face.\n\n*My Lord...*\n\nGuilt crushed him. He wasn't strong enough.\n\n---\n\n**[Glossary of Common Korean Terms](link)**  \n**[OG: Glossary Link](link)**  \n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.  \nCheck out my Patreon for early access to unedited chapters and to help achieve goals for extra chapters.
