  "content": "# **The Swamp Encounter**\n\nHaalrune Swamp sprawled across the lowlands near Reinhardt—a popular hunting ground teeming with monsters ranging from level 130 to 150. What made the swamp particularly attractive were the three field bosses that spawned there: the level 135 Swamp Lion, the level 145 Mud Lamia, and the level 160 Gigant Minion. Each boss dropped valuable loot, and the swamp drew steady traffic from ambitious hunting parties.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be nice to run into a boss?\" someone had mused earlier.\n\nNow, at the swamp's heart, a twenty-one-person party—all hovering around level 140—stood frozen in horror. A Swamp Lion prowled before them. A Mud Lamia coiled nearby. And looming behind both, a Gigant Minion blocked their retreat.\n\n\"How the hell did all three spawn at once?\" the party leader, Hee Dongi, breathed.\n\nField bosses in Haalrune respawned thirty-six to eighty hours after defeat, at random locations throughout the swamp. The odds of all three appearing simultaneously in the same area were astronomically low. His party had come here for routine hunting, not a triple-boss raid.\n\n\"We can't take them! Scatter! Fall back!\" Hee Dongi raised his Mass Production Grid Shield just in time to deflect the Swamp Lion's claws. But the swamp itself became their enemy—thick mud dragged at their legs, turning retreat into a death sentence. The Swamp Lion and Mud Lamia glided through the marsh with predatory ease, closing the distance in seconds.\n\nScreams erupted across the battlefield.\n\n\"No—!\"\n\nHee Dongi's face drained of color as he watched his companions fall one by one.\n\n*We're finished.*\n\nWhat rotten luck. Three field bosses, same place, same time. Who would believe it? \n\n*I even donated to the Church last week!*\n\nGuilt clawed at him as another party member went down. Then—new footsteps. Fast ones, cutting through the swamp where everyone else floundered.\n\n*Who would be stupid enough to run toward this?*\n\nHee Dongi whipped around, ready to curse whoever was making a suicidal charge—and froze.\n\nOvergeared King Grid waded through the mud, his legendary armor and cloak streaked with muck, his crown sitting askew on his head. \n\n\"Stay back!\" someone screamed.\n\nGrid didn't hesitate. His blade flashed, catching the Swamp Lion with a basic strike. Then he advanced a single step, sword rising high.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship.\"\n\nThe air itself seemed to tremble.\n\n\"**Drop.**\"\n\nAn immense, intangible sword materialized above the battlefield—a giant blade of pure energy that descended like divine judgment. It crashed down on all three bosses simultaneously, the shockwave rippling through the swamp.\n\nThe Swamp Lion, already wounded from Grid's opening strike, dissolved into grey ash. The Mud Lamia and Gigant Minion staggered, health bars plummeting.\n\n\"Watch out!\" Hee Dongi shouted.\n\nSurely the survivors would retaliate. But the remaining bosses simply stood there, motionless. Their eyes had glazed over—stunned, or perhaps paralyzed.\n\n*A field boss... afflicted by crowd control?*\n\nBosses were supposed to have high abnormal status resistance. The Gigant Minion was allegedly *immune*. Yet it stood helpless before Grid's technique.\n\nTwo more strikes finished the job. Items and enhancement scrolls scattered across the mud.\n\n\"Thank you!\" Hee Dongi and his surviving party members shouted, half in shock, half in awe. They never imagined they'd meet their king at a mid-level hunting ground—clearly Grid was patrolling beginner areas, looking after his citizens.\n\n\"Keep at it.\" Grid flashed them a smile, collected the boss drops, and vanished into the swamp as quickly as he'd appeared.\n\nBy evening, Satisfy's community forums exploded with posts. **\"The Overgeared King is Built Different\"** trended across multiple boards. Grid's legend grew once more.\n\n---\n\n# **A Temple for the Forgotten God**\n\n\"I'm building a temple,\" Grid announced upon returning from the Vatican. \"Find me the best painters, sculptors, and architects in the kingdom.\"\n\nLauel blinked. \"Another temple?\"\n\nReinhardt already housed three churches dedicated to Goddess Rebecca, complete with priests and paladins. Building another seemed excessive—not to mention expensive.\n\n\"Not for Rebecca,\" Grid clarified. \"For God Hexetia.\"\n\n\"Hexetia? The blacksmith god?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nLauel's skepticism melted into calculation. *A temple for Hexetia—the god nobody worships...*\n\nThen it clicked. \n\n*The Overgeared Kingdom was founded by a blacksmith. Grid's trained an army of craftsmen. If we don't honor the god of smithing, who will? And if our blacksmiths receive divine blessings...*\n\nThe economic implications alone were staggering. Access to divine favor for an entire industry. Potential breakthroughs in crafting quality. International prestige.\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" Lauel's eyes gleamed. \"When did you become so strategic? This is brilliant! A miracle—a waterfall flowing upward—\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n*Strategic?* Grid had no idea what Lauel was raving about. The truth was far simpler: he liked Hexetia and wanted to help him. The possibility of divine blacksmithing buffs hadn't even crossed his mind.\n\n---\n\n# **Portrait of a God**\n\n\"Mid-fifties in appearance. Build and features suggest... Mediterranean descent, perhaps. Bright red hair like flame. Deep-set eye sockets, but the eyes themselves are small and dark—almost black. Sharp features. Hooked nose. Long mustache and beard, both red.\"\n\nPicasso—Satisfy's highest-ranked painter—worked intently at her canvas, brush moving in practiced strokes. When the Overgeared Kingdom posted a commission to *paint a god*, she'd traveled immediately to Reinhardt. Now she sat across from Grid, bringing Hexetia's image to life.\n\n\"Thinner in the face,\" Grid instructed, leaning forward to study her work. \"His skin is tight over the bone. Cheekbones slightly prominent—raise them a fraction.\"\n\n\"Like this?\"\n\n\"Perfect. You're exceptionally skilled.\"\n\n\"System corrections help,\" Picasso demurred.\n\n\"You're too modest.\"\n\nShe said nothing, but privately wondered: *How does he know such detail?* Grid's description was so precise, so vivid—as though he'd stood face-to-face with the deity himself.\n\n*Can players even meet gods? Are gods real in this world?*\n\nHigh-rankers truly lived in a different reality.\n\n\"Bare-chested,\" Grid continued. \"Gray cloth wrapped around his waist like a skirt. His muscles are cracked and weathered—almost bark-like in texture—but harder than steel. Oh, and his nipples are on fire.\"\n\n\"The muscles would be... yes. Nipples on fire. Uh-huh...\" Picasso's brush paused mid-stroke. Her face flushed crimson. \"...What?\"\n\n*Burning nipples? Is this some kind of joke? Sexual harassment!*\n\n\"Picasso? Hey, are you listening?\"\n\n\"Y-Yes! Sorry!\"\n\n*A famous person turned out to be a pervert!* Disappointment and embarrassment warred in her chest. Her face burned hot enough to rival Hexetia's alleged nipples.\n\nGrid frowned. \"Why did you stop? Tired? We can take a break.\"\n\n\"N-No, I just... It's hard to understand what you mean by 'nipples on fire...'\"\n\n\"There are small flames on both nipples—swollen and red from the heat. Blue fire on the left, red fire on the right. Both transparent.\"\n\n\"S-Swollen red nipples...\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Nothing! I'll focus!\" \n\n*Don't give him the satisfaction of a reaction!*\n\nPicasso gritted her teeth and returned to work, determined not to show weakness. The portrait taking shape before her looked increasingly absurd—a half-naked deity with flaming nipples hardly seemed divine. Yet the moment she added the final touches:\n\n> **[You have completed a new work!]**\n>\n> **[The birth of a masterpiece—a perfect depiction of Hexetia, God of the Forge.]**\n>\n> **[Your reputation as the first human to recreate Hexetia's image will spread across the continent!]**\n>\n> **[Royal families and noble houses seek your services! Work as a court painter to earn exceptional rewards!]**\n>\n> **[All stats increased by 20 due to completing a masterpiece.]**\n>\n> **[The voice of Hexetia reaches your ears.]**\n>\n> **—*To capture my beauty so well... Not bad for a human.***\n>\n> **[Affinity with Hexetia increased by 35.]**\n>\n> **[Title Acquired: One Who Has Drawn a God]**\n\nPicasso stood frozen, rewards flooding her notification log. Shock replaced embarrassment. She stared at Grid with newfound respect—and gratitude.\n\n\"Excellent work.\" Grid nodded approval at the canvas. \"Perfect likeness. Thank you.\"\n\n\"It was only possible because of your detailed information.\"\n\n\"Always humble. Lauel—have the sculptor reproduce this portrait as a statue.\"\n\n\"Huroi's flying him in now,\" Lauel confirmed. \"I'll brief him the moment he arrives.\"\n\n\"Huroi's involved?\"\n\n\"The sculptor makes even Huroi look tame... He's demanding an outrageous salary. Leave it to me.\"\n\n\"Appreciated.\"\n\nWith talented people at his disposal, the temple construction would proceed smoothly. Grid smiled with satisfaction.\n\n\"Um...\" Picasso hesitated.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"C-Could I... possibly join the Overgeared Guild?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. We'd be honored to have you.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much!\"\n\n\"The honor's ours.\"\n\nThey exchanged smiles. Through the open windows, the sound of hammers and saws drifted in—construction on Hexetia's temple had already begun.\n\n---\n\n# **A New Path**\n\nGrid and the Seven Malignant Saints.\n\nTruth and lies. Good and evil.\n\nGrid ignored the conceptual boundaries imposed by Satisfy's lore and carved his own path forward—one even the S.A. Group hadn't anticipated.\n\nIn his private office, Chairman Lim Cheolho watched Grid's activities on his monitor, a warm smile touching his lips.\n\n\"Predictable things bore me,\" he murmured."
