Even Braham, whose default mode oscillated between arrogance and disdain for the world's mediocrity, had acknowledged their potential. The vampire had advised Grid to nurture them, to give them opportunities to learn and evolve.\n\nYet Grid hadn't expected much. The Overgeared Skeletons started at level one, their base statistics laughable, their growth rate glacial.\n\n*I thought they'd be useless for months.*\n\nA miscalculation. The skeletons could materialize anywhere within a meter of Grid at will, transforming them into perfect mobile shields even at level one. Now their unique learning capability was bearing fruit. After nine deaths to silver thread attacks, they'd adapted.\n\n*Wait... accustomed to it? Does that mean they've analyzed the silver thread's properties?*\n\nThrough repeated destruction, the skeletons had dissected the thread's characteristics—its attack patterns, its elemental composition, its weaknesses. Then they'd restructured their skeletal frames to resist it more effectively.\n\n*They're not one-time shields anymore. They're... learning.*\n\nStill, reality tempered his enthusiasm. Level one meant three strength, three stamina, three agility, one intelligence. A pitiful forty-five health points total. Analysis and adaptation wouldn't prevent death—merely delay it.\n\n*When I get back to the village, I'll need to power-level them on chickens or something.*\n\nThe thought brought a smile. Watching them grow felt... satisfying.\n\n**CRASH!**\n\nGrid pressed his assault on the armored needles before him.\n\n**SHRRRRRRK!**\n\nSilver thread erupted from behind, whipping toward his back. Grid's lips curved into a smirk. He downed a mana potion and summoned his skeletal guardians again.\n\n\"Come out!\"\n\n***Clack! Clack!***\n\nBone scraped against bone as the skeletons emerged from shadow and earth. Grid had once found that distinctive rattle irritating. Now it sounded like music.\n\n*My beautiful boys. Now block with those reinforced frames and—*\n\nHis thought died mid-sentence.\n\n*...What?*\n\nThe Overgeared Skeletons materialized directly in the silver thread's path as expected. But instead of intercepting the attack, they—\n\nThey *dodged*.\n\n\"What the—?!\"\n\nThe skeletal shields twisted aside with unexpected grace, abandoning their defensive position entirely.\n\nWhich meant Grid, standing directly behind them, took the full brunt of the assault.\n\n**SHHHT!**\n\n> [You have been attacked!]\n> [The Protection Talisman has been activated!]\n> [A shield to block the damage has been created!]\n> [Your defense will increase by 20% for 2 minutes.]\n\n\"...\"\n\nA boss-worthy consumable. Wasted. Because his own summons had betrayed him.\n\nGrid's eye twitched. His jaw clenched. Then he exploded.\n\n\"YOU USELESS BAGS OF BONES!\"\n\nSummoned to act as shields—*specifically* to take damage—and they had the audacity to dodge?!\n\nThe Overgeared Skeletons stared back at him with hollow eye sockets. Not a flicker of guilt. Not even the skeleton equivalent of an apologetic shrug.\n\nAnd Grid realized: of course they weren't sorry. A pet's fundamental obligation was to assist its master when summoned. But these skeletons had died nine consecutive times to silver thread attacks. They'd learned their role, yes—but they'd also learned to *survive* it.\n\nSelf-preservation had become instinct. Why die pointlessly when they could evade?\n\n> [Overgeared Skeleton One and Overgeared Skeleton Two have acquired the skill 'Avoid the Silver Thread.']\n>\n> **[Avoid the Silver Thread]**\n> Category: Passive\n> There is a low chance of avoiding the silver thread wielded by armored needles.\n\n*Not increased durability. Evasion.*\n\nGrid's anger cooled as understanding dawned. For a summon to independently develop the appropriate counter-skill based purely on experience and judgment... that was extraordinary potential.\n\n*Can skeleton warriors actually evolve into death knights?*\n\n***Clack! Clack-clack!***\n\nTheir ribcages expanded and contracted as if speaking, hollow gazes fixed on Grid. Waiting. Expectant.\n\nGrid sighed, tension bleeding from his shoulders.\n\n\"...Fine. Well done. Good work.\"\n\nHe'd lost a valuable item, but witnessing the skeletons' growth potential soothed the sting. Grid actually chuckled as he issued his next command.\n\n\"Stand still and observe how I fight. Study it.\"\n\n**CRACK!**\n\nTranscend's duration expired. Grid accelerated his swings with **+9 <span class=\"color-blue-orichalcum\">Failure</span>**, abandoning stamina conservation for raw offense. His advantage was slipping. The armored needles had adapted to his ranged assault patterns.\n\n**SHRRRRRRK!**\n\nThe creatures crossed their silver threads in mid-air, weaving them together into an intricate lattice barrier—a makeshift spiderweb shield.\n\n**CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!**\n\nTranscend's sword waves crashed against the layered threads and shattered harmlessly.\n\n*Impressive.*\n\nRather than panic, Grid felt genuine admiration. He'd known from the start that a single strand of silver thread possessed greater tensile strength than steel cable. Dozens woven together could theoretically halt any physical force.\n\nTheoretically.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship.\"\n\n**THUNK!**\n\nThe instant Transcend's effect faded, Grid abandoned his defensive position. He charged straight into melee range.\n\n\"What?!\"\n\nHan Sua gasped. The Red Phoenix Group members froze in shock as Grid plunged toward the armored needles.\n\n\"He's entering the silver thread's optimal range!\" one member shouted, voice cracking with urgency. \"That's suicide!\"\n\nArmored needles excelled at close-quarters combat. Facing six simultaneously, alone, was tactical insanity.\n\n\"We need to support him,\" Sua decided, already moving forward with her team.\n\nThen—\n\n\"...Huh?\"\n\n\"No way...\"\n\nThey stopped dead.\n\n\"Pinnacle Kill.\"\n\nWhite light flared as Grid reached the silver thread barrier. \n\n**SHHHHHING!**\n\n\"...!\"\n\nThe spiderweb shield *split*—left and right, threads severing like cut rope. The armored needle behind the barrier cleaved vertically in half, its body separating into perfect mirror halves.\n\nFailure's **Bisect** effect combined with Pinnacle Kill's defense-ignoring property. Unstoppable.\n\n> [Critical Hit!]\n> [You have defeated an armored needle.]\n> [123,509,000 experience has been acquired.]\n\n*Beautiful!*\n\nThe experience reward matched the creature's difficulty perfectly. Grid's heart soared as he surged through the opening, activating Linked Kill.\n\n**THUD!**\n\nOne strike.\n\n**THUD! THUD!**\n\nTwo. Three.\n\n**THUD-THUD-THUD!**\n\nFour! Five! *Six!*\n\nThe bombardment of Linked Kill Wave followed by Linked Kill proper overwhelmed the remaining armored needles. Their health bars evaporated. They collapsed into grey light, one after another.\n\nBut Grid couldn't relax yet. The largest threat remained—the fused armored needle.\n\n\"*Meow!* It hurts!\"\n\nNoe's anguished cry pierced the battlefield din. Grid's head snapped toward the sound. His demonic cat was still engaged solo with the fused armored needle, and losing badly. Noe's plump body was riddled with puncture wounds. His normally pristine black fur was matted with dirt and blood. His tail hung limp. His eyes glistened with moisture.\n\nGrid activated Restraint without hesitation, targeting the fused armored needle to rescue Noe from the silver thread cocoon binding him. The creature recoiled, and the threads loosened their stranglehold.\n\n\"*Mew...*\"\n\nNoe flapped his wings frantically, launching himself toward Grid, who caught him and scratched behind his ears.\n\n\"You did well. Rest now.\"\n\n\"*Meow*... I'll be expecting a gourmet meal.\"\n\nNoe vanished into the pet inventory. The fused armored needle's attention locked fully onto Grid.\n\n\"**KYAAAAOOOH!**\"\n\n**TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!**\n\nDozens of silver threads launched simultaneously, streaking through the air like bullets.\n\n*Gulp.*\n\nGrid swallowed hard. The gatekeeper Ung had strength comparable to a single armored needle. One punch from him had dealt 2,303 damage. This fused variant was exponentially more dangerous. A direct hit could cost him 23,000 health—at minimum. Likely much more.\n\nEven Grid's monstrous health pool felt insufficient.\n\n\"Quick Movements!\"\n\nAs the silver threads locked onto their target, Grid burned a buff to boost his agility, then deployed Randy and the God Hands as additional barriers. But they could only intercept two or three threads each. The rest Grid would have to handle personally.\n\n\"Link!\"\n\n**CLANG!**\n\n**CLAAAANG!**\n\nSeveral minutes into the engagement, Grid had memorized the silver thread attack patterns well enough to predict trajectories. But the fused armored needle controlled nearly *triple* the threads of a standard variant. Hidden attacks kept emerging from unexpected angles.\n\n**SHRRRRRRK!**\n\nAs Grid deflected one volley, the fused needle fired another salvo from blind spots.\n\n*Can't dodge this!*\n\nMultiple silver threads pierced his chest. Han Sua and the Red Phoenix Group turned pale.\n\n\"Duke of Virtue!\"\n\n\"Grid!\"\n\nHe was dead. Everyone thought so.\n\nBut—\n\n> [<span class=\"color-legendary\">Lantier's Cloak</span> has reduced the damage of all stabbing and cutting attacks by 20%.]\n> [<span class=\"color-legendary\">Triple Layers</span> has reduced physical damage by 30%.]\n> [<span class=\"color-legendary\">Triple Layers</span> has reduced the damage of stabbing attacks by 50%.]\n> [You have suffered 2,195 damage.]\n> [You have suffered 2,308 damage.]\n> [You have suffered 2,240 damage.]\n> [You have suffe—]\n> ...\n> [The enemy's weapon has been caught by the niches in <span class=\"color-legendary\">Triple Layers</span>, activating Sword Break.]\n> [The target's weapon durability has dropped.]\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Wait... that barely tickled.*\n\nGrid blinked, more surprised by his own survival than if he'd died. Behind him, Sua and the Red Phoenix Group stood frozen in disbelief.\n\n**CRACK-CRACK-CRACK!**\n\nThe silver threads—caught in Triple Layers' specialized gaps—*shattered*.\n\n\"I-Impossible...\"\n\nThe legendary silver thread that had killed hundreds of players... neutralized by armor. Not just blocked—*broken*.\n\n\"How?\" Sua's voice trembled. \"How are you this strong?\"\n\nGrid glanced over his shoulder, a cocky grin spreading across his face.\n\n\"It's called being overgeared.\"\n\n**BOOM!**\n\nHe spun back and cleaved the fused armored needle's head clean off."
