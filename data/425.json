Players defended against an endless monster horde, installing turrets and traps from supplies scattered throughout the arena. Victory belonged to whoever survived the longest. Strategic placement of defenses separated champions from corpses.\n\nPark Jonghwa represented South Korea in the event.\n\nThe stadium screens flickered as the commentators analyzed the final results.\n\n\"Lauel of the United States takes the gold medal, with Bondre of France claiming silver!\"\n\n\"Bondre maintained a strong position through the midpoint, but his concentration shattered in the second phase.\"\n\n\"The real turning point came when flying monsters appeared en masse. He simply didn't have enough anti-aircraft guns installed.\"\n\n\"Contrast that with Lauel's preparation. Flying monsters didn't spawn until the second half, yet he'd been building anti-aircraft defenses from the start. He never ignored what was on the equipment list.\"\n\n\"Bronze goes to Vantner of Canada, who demonstrated exceptional trap usage.\"\n\n\"His taunting and charging skills funneled monsters into kill zones with precision. Quite admirable.\"\n\n\"Hard to believe this is the same hot-blooded player who grabbed Chris' ankle during target processing.\"\n\n\"Well, tanks are supposed to excel at teamwork. Yet Vantner seems more specialized for solo play. He's going to be an unpredictable element in Overgeared.\"\n\nPon snorted from his seat in the Korean section. \"He's a vacuum, not a variable.\"\n\nThe sarcasm came wrapped in a smile. He and Vantner fought daily, but years of friendship ran deeper than their bickering. Pride swelled in Pon's chest at his guildmate's victory.\n\nThe second event, 'Catching Pigs', presented a different challenge. Thousands of identical pink pigs filled an arena. Participants had to identify and eliminate only those bearing black dots. The unmarked pigs possessed infinite health. Kill one by mistake, and the herd simply grew larger.\n\nVictory demanded flawless observation and unbreakable focus.\n\n\"Brazil's Jishuka claims gold!\"\n\n\"Her observational abilities are phenomenal. How does she spot those tiny dots among thousands of identical targets?\"\n\n\"Has to be Hawk Eyes. The skill lets her see clearly at thirty meters while maintaining a safe distance.\"\n\n\"Even when the crowd churned after each elimination, she never missed a shot. That concentration is world-class.\"\n\n\"Jishuka alone scored higher than places two through five combined.\"\n\n\"In one word: overwhelming.\"\n\nBrazil secured gold, Britain took silver, and the United States claimed bronze. Nations with exceptional archers dominated the leaderboard.\n\nJishuka addressed the press conference afterward. Cameras focused on one of the world's most captivating women.\n\nShe leaned toward the microphone. \"Grid, did you see? Tonight, I'm coming to your room to receive my congratulations.\"\n\nThe internet exploded.\n\n*Going to his room? What the hell?*\n\n*An adult man and woman alone in a room at night...*\n\n*Damn, I'm so jealous of Grid right now.*\n\n*He must have saved the planet in a past life.*\n\n*Lucky bastard.*\n\nGrid rubbed his ears. \"Why do they feel so hot?\"\n\nWhile he became public enemy number one among the world's male population, the competition pushed forward.\n\nThen came the afternoon's third event.\n\nHell Running. The map reproduced a section of Hell itself. First player to reach the destination while avoiding environmental hazards and demonkin attacks would claim victory. Interest among Satisfy players reached fever pitch, rivaling even team events and PvP.\n\nHell. A chance to experience the legendary realm that no player had yet reached.\n\nLauel materialized in the reserved Korean seating area. He dropped into the seat beside Grid.\n\n\"You should pay attention.\" Lauel's eyes gleamed. \"Hell is likely to be the ultimate endgame content in Satisfy.\"\n\nThe other Korean representatives edged away. They still couldn't handle his over-the-top declarations.\n\n\"Hell will be one of countless lands under your rule.\"\n\nGrid wore his interpreter device. \"Hell... It was a little strange.\"\n\nLauel stiffened. \"Have you visited Hell before?\"\n\n\"Just for a short time.\"\n\n\"Holy shit.\"\n\nVisiting Hell? It sounded like a bad joke or empty boasting. But Grid was the one saying it. Lauel had no choice but to believe.\n\n\"What was it like?\"\n\nGrid's attention shifted to the starting line. Yura stood among the competitors representing South Korea. \"Confirm it with your own eyes. Much better than hearing about my few minutes there.\"\n\n*My demonic power is at 830 now.* The number sat heavy in Grid's mind. *I could end up back there any time.*\n\n***\n\nExperiencing content before the masses provided undeniable advantages. Better information. Faster progression. A foundation for explosive growth. Hell Running represented exactly that opportunity, and the participant roster reflected its importance.\n\nZibal of the United States. Hao of China. Seuron of Argentina. Regas of Britain. The strongest representatives from each nation had entered this event with identical priorities: experience Hell firsthand. The gold medal mattered less than individual development. National honor took a backseat to personal power.\n\nThe public's criticism? They didn't care. Their ambitions reached higher.\n\nKraugel had predicted this. That's why Alexander ran instead. Kraugel judged Alexander capable of securing gold while he focused on other events. The opportunity to experience Hell was sacrificed, but his mother's treatment demanded every available resource.\n\n> [You have entered Hell.]\n\n> [You are affected by strong evil energy.]\n\n> [Your body is exhausted. Attack power, defense, and agility decreased by 30%.]\n\n> [Health will not recover naturally.]\n\n> [You have received a mental blow. Mana regeneration rate reduced by 50%.]\n\n\"That's a lot of debuffs.\"\n\n\"No natural health recovery? We're completely dependent on potions and healing skills?\"\n\n\"Look at the mana regeneration speed. We can't spam skills here.\"\n\n\"Solo play in Hell is impossible.\"\n\nThe representatives exchanged worried glances. Hell itself rejected them. But Yura's experience differed entirely.\n\n> [Hell is a Demon Slayer's true stage!]\n\n> [All stats increased by 20%.]\n\n> [Skill cooldown time reduced by 20%.]\n\n> [Power of all purification skills increased by 15%.]\n\n> [Magic bullet production rate increased to maximum.]\n\n> [Health and mana regeneration rate increased by 50%.]\n\n*My stage.*\n\nAmazement and exhilaration flooded through Yura. The Demon Slayer class finally revealed its true nature. She'd struggled with doubts before, comparing herself endlessly to Grid's overwhelming power. Of course, Grid had unlocked multiple hidden pieces while she'd found none. Even accounting for that disparity, her combat-specialized legendary class had felt weak compared to Pagma's Descendant.\n\nAnxiety had crept in. Had she chosen wrong?\n\nBut now the truth crystallized. Demon Slayer exerted its full strength in Hell. Once the developers opened Hell content to the masses, she would stand at the apex.\n\n*I can finally look forward to the future.*\n\n\"Thirty-two participants representing their nations stand at the starting line.\"\n\n\"We've assembled the greatest players on the planet.\"\n\n\"I'm particularly interested in Damian, Hao, Seuron, Zibal, Pon, and Regas.\"\n\n\"We can't predict what variables Hell will introduce, but right now? Those six are the favorites.\"\n\n\"Damian especially. A pope wielding the Goddess of Light's power should devastate demonkin.\"\n\n\"Agreed. This event suits Damian better than Kraugel.\"\n\n\"Is that why Kraugel opted out?\"\n\nNobody paid attention to Yura. Her struggle against Kraugel had lowered expectations. Her hidden class appeared mediocre, its limitations obvious.\n\nThat perception wouldn't last long.\n\nHell moon. The indicator separated those who'd experienced the Behen Archipelago from those who hadn't. Yura dispatched demonkin with clinical efficiency while avoiding environmental hazards. Other participants stumbled, still struggling to comprehend Hell's basic mechanics.\n\nAlexander ran alone, frustration building as Yura pulled ahead.\n\n*This damn girl.*\n\nBeautiful. Skilled. But still yellow-skinned. Kraugel and Grid were inevitable forces, but other Asians shouldn't surpass him. The race itself was inferior.\n\nAlexander channeled his contempt into action. Hardened aura stretched out like a spear, stabbing toward Yura's back.\n\nAlexander's level exceeded Yura's by a significant margin. Objectively speaking, he should crush her. But he'd miscalculated.\n\nThe environment changed everything. Alexander struggled under crippling debuffs while Yura thrived under massive buffs.\n\n\"Kuaaaaak!\"\n\nYura spun, transforming her weapon into a sword. Metal shrieked against hardened aura. She shifted back to gun mode and fired. Magic bullets tore into Alexander's chest.\n\nHe screamed.\n\nYura fired again. And again. Then she closed the distance, blade reforming in her hands.\n\nAfter that, the outcome was never in doubt. Yura won gold. Alexander barely escaped with his life and claimed silver.\n\nThe event concluded. Reporters swarmed. Yura found the camera lens and held its gaze.\n\n\"Grid, tonight I will come to your room for my reward.\" Her expression remained calm, but her voice trembled. \"Please let me in.\"\n\nRed flooded across her pale cheeks. Embarrassment warred with determination. She refused to lose to Jishuka.\n\nThe internet combusted.\n\n*GRID YOU BASTARD*\n\n*How does one man steal two beautiful women with no conscience?*\n\nJealousy incarnated across the globe. Grid's anti-fan cafe, quiet for weeks, roared back to life."
