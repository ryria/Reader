He only struck a few times before the man died.\n\n*How did he even reach the semi-finals?*\n\nIyarugt sat at 98.3% experience. Close. So damn close to evolving. Grid's plan had been simple: rack up as much combat data as possible before facing Kraugel. But Dean folded like wet paper after a handful of strikes. It wasn't even satisfying.\n\n*I should've held back.*\n\nHao. Chris. Damian. Pon. Grid had spent so much time fighting monsters in human skin that he'd lost his sense of scale. He'd swung at Dean with the same intensity he'd used against the others—and the poor bastard never stood a chance.\n\n\"Cough...\"\n\nGrid cleared his throat and logged out.\n\nLauel sat with the US representatives, his expression flat. Grid caught the look. Frustration. Disappointment.\n\n*Now everything depends on Kraugel.*\n\nBack to square one. No tricks. No schemes. Just Kraugel, doing what Kraugel always did—winning through sheer, overwhelming skill.\n\n*Win. You have to win.*\n\nLauel's jaw tightened. *If you want to save your mother.*\n\nThe third-place match began. Skull versus Dean. Skull dismantled him. The 8th ranker moved with the precision of someone who'd gone toe-to-toe with Kraugel and survived—barely. The crowd ate it up.\n\n\"Well fought, Skull!\"\n\n\"You're a goddamn hero!\"\n\nThe Americans roared. Skull had bled for his country, dragged them as high as he could carry them. When the cameras caught him crying—frustrated, helpless—the crowd lost it.\n\n\"Next year...\" Skull choked out. \"Next year will be different...\"\n\nLauel felt the guilt twist in his chest. He'd thrown the siege. Deliberately. To get Kraugel into Overgeared. That decision had cost America first place in the overall rankings.\n\nBut Lauel was Overgeared's Chief of Staff. Loyalty to the guild came first.\n\n\"This is the fate of those who bear a mission...\" He muttered in Korean. \"I'll pay this price in my next life...\"\n\nThe US representatives beside him shifted uncomfortably, hands curling into fists. They didn't understand the words, but they understood the tone.\n\n***\n\nThe PvP finals.\n\nAfter nearly a month of competition, the world had narrowed to this: one stage, two men, infinite stakes. Even the elderly had their TVs locked on OGC. Russia and South Korea were powder kegs.\n\nFirst place hung in the balance. Grid versus Kraugel. Winner takes all.\n\n> **\"I'm so proud of Grid. South Korea's status in Satisfy has skyrocketed because of him. Foreign players can't mock us anymore—not on the forums, not anywhere. It feels good.\"**\n\n> **\"I never thought we'd be ranked first. Grid made watching this tournament actually fun.\"**\n\n> **\"Our chicken shop's sales are up 2,000% this month! Grid saved our business. He's my family's benefactor!\"**\n\n> **\"My parents are in their seventies—never cared about Satisfy. Now they watch Grid on the news every night. We bought a capsule because of him. Comet Group, of course.\"**\n\n> **\"Satisfy membership for people over 70 is exploding. The elderly are calling it a 'second life'...\"**\n\n> **\"S.A. Group and Comet Group stock prices are soaring. Economists are calling this the 'Grid Effect'—South Korea's economic growth is directly tied to him...\"**\n\n> **\"Japanese and Chinese tourists are flooding Seoul's outskirts, visiting the construction sites where Grid and the Overgeared members are building. Economists say this could become a new commercial district.\"**\n\n> **\"The K-pop group 'We are Legendary Class' just dropped a new song ahead of the finals. It's called 'God Grid's Praise Song.' Two minutes after release, it hit #1 on every real-time music chart. Their agency, Urek Entertainment, is confident it'll make the Billboard chart.\"**\n\n> **\"Top star Song Yekyo secretly flew to Paris last night. She posted on social media supporting Grid. Netizens are speculating she's his next conquest after Yura and Jishuka.\"**\n\n> **\"The President announced at a luncheon with the ruling and opposition parties that South Korea needs a 'second and third Grid.' Both parties agreed. The 'Satisfy Rankers Training Policy' is heading to parliament soon...\"**\n\nThe ripples from Grid's success had become a tsunami. His parents and Sehee watched the news with growing unease. The attention was too much. Too intense. They worried it would crush him—or worse, corrupt him.\n\nBut Grid wasn't the same man he'd been a year ago. Reidan had tempered him. He'd learned to manage expectations, navigate fame, resist manipulation. And now? He had people. Real allies. Lauel. Jishuka. The entire Overgeared Guild actively working to protect him.\n\nHe'd be fine.\n\n***\n\n> **\"No one doubts Grid's abilities after he bulldozed his way to the finals. He's the strongest.\"**\n\n> **\"Sure—after Kraugel. The latest prediction survey shows only 5% expect Grid to win. Almost everyone is betting on Kraugel.\"**\n\n> **\"It's unavoidable. Kraugel's undefeated record speaks for itself. His abilities exceed Grid's.\"**\n\n> **\"One variable: Grid's immortal passive. That skill might be the key to this match.\"**\n\n\"...\"\n\nThirty minutes until the finals. Kraugel sat alone in the waiting room. Eyes closed. Breathing steady. Meditating.\n\n*Mother.*\n\nThe only irreplaceable thing in his world. His father died when he was young—illness. His mother had sacrificed everything to raise him alone.\n\n*I can sacrifice anything for her.*\n\n\"The effect of this new drug is certain. Clinical trials are complete. However, there are no plans for commercialization. Why? Because I know its tremendous value. This medicine will be one of Russia's most powerful bargaining tools. Haha, medicine should be used to heal people? That's right—but only people with value.\"\n\nThe Russian government's words echoed in Kraugel's mind. *If you want it, improve your status in Russia.*\n\nKraugel opened the pendant around his neck. Inside, a portrait of his mother. \n\n\"Mother...\"\n\nHe had no memories of her being healthy. Just a weak, exhausted woman working herself to the bone to raise him. Aging too fast. Always sick.\n\nThis was his chance to repay her. The only chance.\n\n\"...Definitely.\"\n\nHe would see her smile. Healthy. Alive.\n\n*Win.*\n\nFailure was not an option. Kraugel swallowed the poison in his heart and stood. Five minutes until the finals.\n\n***\n\n\"Lauel, why don't you just tell Grid the truth?\" Vantner leaned forward. \"Explain Kraugel's situation. A person's life is at stake. Grid will throw the match, Kraugel joins the guild, everyone wins.\"\n\nJishuka cut him off. \"Lauel doesn't want to put that on Grid.\"\n\nShe kept her gaze forward, watching the stage. \"He wants Kraugel for Grid's sake—for Overgeared's sake. And he knows how much Grid wants this win. If Grid knew about Kraugel's mother, it'd destroy him. The guilt. The pressure. Everything Lauel's trying to avoid.\"\n\n\"Objectively, we should pray Lauel's wish comes true.\"\n\nJishuka's voice softened.\n\n\"But Grid... win.\"\n\nShe wouldn't drag Grid down for Kraugel's problems. Grid had worked too hard. Sacrificed too much. His dream mattered, too.\n\n***\n\n> **\"There are many ways to describe this man, but one suffices: The Peak of Two Billion Users! Kraugel!!\"**\n\n\"WAAAAAHHHHH!\"\n\n\"THE SKY ABOVE THE SKY! THE SKY ABOVE THE SKY!\"\n\n\"Show us the dignity of the 1st rank!\"\n\nThe roar was deafening. Kraugel climbed onto the stage. Fans from every country screamed his name.\n\nThen Grid's turn.\n\n> **\"The fury of South Korea! The first legendary class! Grid!!\"**\n\n\"GO GRID!\"\n\n\"Show us there's no eternal king!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Duguen! Duguen! Duguen!*\n\nGrid couldn't hear the cheering. Just his heartbeat. Loud. Fast. Hammering against his ribs.\n\nHe was nervous. Terrified, even. But he kept his face blank. He refused to look weak in front of his rival.\n\n\"Kraugel.\"\n\nBefore the host could announce the start, Grid locked eyes with him. His voice came out steady. Solemn.\n\n\"I will obtain the title of the strongest.\""
