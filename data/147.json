Every legendary item he'd forged before now—the Sword of Self-transcendence, the Divine Shield, even Thorn of Deep Grievance—they were excellent, yes. But not *the best*. Dainsleif, that Unique-rated masterpiece from Albatino's era, had always loomed over them like a benchmark he couldn't quite reach.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nThe greatsword in his grip was undeniably superior. *Dainsleif? Throw it to the dogs.*\n\n\"It's different.\" The words came out as a whisper. Grid's hands trembled. \"Now I am the best.\"\n\nThe strongest armor set. The strongest weapon. \n\n*Invincible.*\n\nHis throat tightened. *Who would've imagined a talent-less gamer like me... would reach this point?* Before Pagma's Descendant, he'd ground away for a year just to hit level 80. One year. Eighty levels.\n\n\"In the end...\"\n\nGrid clenched both fists.\n\n\"I'm a winner!\"\n\nThe words exploded out of him. Top rankers? Game geniuses? They were all destined to kneel before the power of items.\n\n\"Hahahaha! Aren't I raising my level too quickly? The system isn't as good as items. Hahahaha!\"\n\nIf the rankers grinding mobs right now could hear him, they'd lose their minds.\n\n\"Blood Witch Yura? Our next encounter will be different!\" He spun in a circle, laughing at the ceiling. \"Now I'm better than her! Hahaha! Kek! Kek! Huh?\"\n\nThe laughter died in his throat.\n\nA notification window materialized before his eyes.\n\n> [You have proven your potential by making five legendary items.]\n\n*This?*\n\nHis pulse quickened. The Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship description had mentioned something special would happen at five legendary items. More windows cascaded into view.\n\n> [You have grown enough. You are no longer a nameless blacksmith.]\n\n> [All future items you make will be engraved with your initial 'G.']\n\n> [It will become known all over the world that Pagma's Descendant has been born.]\n\n> [Your potential is blooming.]\n\n> [The penalty that occurs when an item's usage conditions aren't met is reduced by 15% per rating.]\n\n> [The penalty of an item's options being reduced by 50% when an item's usage conditions aren't met will disappear.]\n\n> [The speed of item understanding will become two times faster.]\n\n\"Yes!\" Grid punched the air. The reduced penalties alone were massive. His heart hammered against his ribs. But then—\n\n> [Your growth has deteriorated due to the blossoming of your potential.]\n\n> [The amount of stats acquired when making items will drop.]\n\n> [You won't acquire any additional stats in the future when making items with a rare rating.]\n\n> [You won't acquire any additional stats in the future when making items with an epic rating.]\n\n> [When unique rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +4.]\n\n> [When legendary rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +10.]\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe air left his lungs.\n\nBefore, he'd earned +2 to all stats for Rare items. +4 for Epic. +12 for Unique. +25 for Legendary. Now? His potential *blossoming*—he mentally corrected it to *depleting*—had gutted those gains.\n\n\"Dammit...!\"\n\nLong-term, this was catastrophic. Not just damage. *Huge* damage.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh! These damn operators!\"\n\nWhy were they nerfing legendary classes so blatantly? This was a balance patch aimed directly at him. His scream echoed off the smithy walls.\n\nMeanwhile, the notifications continued.\n\n> [The class of Pagma's Descendant will be revealed to the world. Do you want to register for the rankings and announce that you are Pagma's Descendant?]\n\nOld Grid would've shouted YES. Fame. Celebrity status. Broadcasting contracts.\n\nNot anymore.\n\n\"I don't want to.\"\n\nHe'd watched Jishuka and the other famous Tzedakah members get mobbed everywhere they went. The crowds. The constant attention. \n\n*Besides, selling items is more profitable than broadcasting fees.*\n\n> [You won't be registered in the rankings.]\n\n> [The information for the Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship skill has been updated.]\n\n**[(Witness of God's Weapon) Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship Skill]**\n**Lv.3 (87.1%)**\n\nProduce equipment items that you know how to make.\n\nYou can create the production methods for a new item with the 'Legendary Blacksmith's Creation' skill.\n\nYou can produce myth rated items.\n\nThere is a high probability of producing rare to epic rated items.\n\nThere is a certain probability of creating unique rated items.\n\nThere is a rare probability of creating legendary rated items.\n\nThere is a very rare probability of making myth grade items.\n\n* All stats of a production items will increase by 17%.\n* When unique rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +4 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +150.\n* When legendary rated items are produced, all stats will permanently rise by +10 and reputation throughout the continent will rise by +500.\n* When myth rated items are produced, your reputation throughout the continent will rise by +1,000.\n* Something special will occur with every five legendary items created. (Currently 5/10)\n\n\"This is real. It really isn't a joke...\"\n\nThe skill description looked miserable compared to before. His gaze snagged on the counter. *Special events every five legendaries.*\n\n\"Legendary items? I won't make them.\"\n\nThe special events were just balance patches in disguise.\n\n*But... it's not completely terrible.* The reduced penalties were genuinely good. Maybe the next milestone would bring even better rewards. He forced himself to think positively.\n\nA final window appeared.\n\n> [You currently have 11,830 reputation throughout the continent. You can use the Reputation Store when your reputation reaches over 30,000.]\n\n> **[Reputation Store]**\n> A special store for all users. It is possible to purchase goods with reputation.\n> There are many rare items, so please be sure to use it.\n> The store's location will periodically change.\n\nThe system waited until *after* nerfing his reputation gains to tell him about the store?\n\nGrid's face flushed crimson. \"These operators—@$&*(!~$#@#[email protected]*!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nKhan stood in the corner, watching Grid cycle from ecstatic joy to volcanic rage after creating the strongest weapon in existence.\n\n*It's been a while since I've seen this...*\n\n***\n\nS.A. Group headquarters. Operations floor.\n\nYoon Nahee and her team clustered around the monitor, watching the exact moment Grid forged Failure. Admiring gasps rippled through the group.\n\n\"Wow, amazing. A legendary rated item on the first try?\"\n\n\"He usually churns out Normal and Rare items, so his luck's improving, right?\" Another team member grinned. \"Late bloomer.\"\n\nYoon Sangmin spoke up from his corner desk. \"Now that he's obtained the strongest legendary weapon, the balance will collapse rapidly.\"\n\nTeam Leader Yoon Nahee shook her head. \"Rather, the balance will be adjusted.\"\n\nThe monitor switched to Grid's POV. The cascading notification windows appeared in perfect clarity.\n\n\"He acquires less stats and reputation when making items now.\" Yoon Sangmin sneered. \"Isn't this way too delayed?\"\n\nSeveral team members exchanged confused looks.\n\n\"Don't you understand how this works?\" Nahee's tone was patient. \"Satisfy's core systems are already established. Unless we add a new episode or event-driven quest, there's no reason to patch existing mechanics.\"\n\n\"Then what is this? Was this skill change scheduled from the start?\"\n\nNahee nodded. \"Exactly. Pagma's Descendant isn't a pure combat class. Its fighting ability is lower than other legendary classes, so it can't be allowed to grow infinitely through stat bonuses.\" She paused. \"Though based on the current situation, I don't think his combat power will fall behind the other legendary classes...\"\n\nThe problem was Grid's terrible luck. According to supercomputer Morpheus' predictions, Pagma's Descendant should have made five legendary items three months ago, triggering the nerf much earlier. But Grid's misfortune had prevented him from crafting legendaries despite repeated attempts. He'd churned out low-rated items for months.\n\nAs a result, Grid enjoyed the stat-synergistic effects far longer than Morpheus predicted. Bad luck turned into good luck.\n\n\"I don't know if he's lucky or unlucky...\"\n\nAt that moment, the entire world shook.\n\nA system message appeared before every user logged into Satisfy.\n\n> [A successor to Pagma's techniques and will has emerged. He is the only legend in the world who can produce legendary items.]\n\n***\n\nBreaking news flooded every channel.\n\n**[Who is Pagma?]**\n\n**[Pagma, a legendary blacksmith and master of the sword!]**\n\n**[Is Pagma's Descendant a legendary class?]**\n\n**[It is estimated to be legendary thanks to the phrase 'legendary.']**\n\n**[The only legendary item maker!]**\n\n**[The first legendary class out of two billion users has appeared!]**\n\n**[(Column) What is the power of a legendary class?]**\n\n**[The 1st ranked blacksmith Panmir: 'I am not Pagma's Descendant.']**\n\n**[The top guilds are already in action to find Pagma's Descendant...]**\n\n**[Is Pagma's Descendant the creator of the Special Jaffa Arrow?]**\n\n**[The possessor of the third epic class, Katz: 'Pagma's Descendant? The legendary class is just a blacksmith. It's nothing in front of the Blood Warrior. I'll give him enough money to become my personal blacksmith.' Katz' arrogant remark!]**\n\nThe reaction dwarfed the announcement of the Epic classes. The media frenzy reached panic levels.\n\nThe S.A. Group judged the atmosphere was overheating and took action.\n\n\"Immediately activate the quests for the national competition in the game.\" Lim Cheolho's command was crisp. \"It will disperse people's attention.\"\n\nA new notification window materialized before every Satisfy user.\n\n> [In two months of real time, a national competition will be held in honor of each country. Participants will be recruited. Prove your abilities by completing in-game quests.]\n\nThe media's attention fractured.\n\n**[Various event quests have been created in the game. Special rewards just for participating?]**\n\n**[The S.A. Group's national competition will be hosted in South Korea!]**\n\n**[Events include boss raids, PvP, pet marathon, labyrinth breakthrough, production games, siege warfare...]**\n\n**[Chairman Lim Cheolho: 'If you are selected as a national representative, there will be tremendous rewards.']**\n\n**[(Column) The first legendary class, Pagma's Descendant. Will he also participate in the national competition?]**\n\n**[What country is Pagma's Descendant from?]**\n\n**[The country that Pagma's Descendant belongs to will be the national champion.]**\n\nIn the end, all roads led back to Pagma's Descendant.\n\n***\n\nKhan's smithy.\n\nGrid ignored the world's obsession. He had work to do.\n\nJishuka's request had been clear. \"It's highly likely there will be war with the Yatan Church. We need your skills. I hope you can produce items for all guild members within a month.\"\n\n\"One month? Hey, then I won't have time to participate in the event quests.\"\n\n\"Omo?\" Her smile was sharp. \"Do you plan to compete in the national competition? Can you cope with the storm that will happen once your identity is revealed? *Pag.ma's. De.scend.ant?*\"\n\n\"...Too annoying.\"\n\nVantner was the most desperate.\n\n\"Grid! My armor!\"\n\nGrid pulled up the production method.\n\n> **[Wave Armor]**\n> Rating: Rare ~ Legendary\n>\n> **Rare Rating Information:**\n> Durability: 420/420 Defense: 531 Movement Speed: -8%\n> * Reduces damage received by 40% if health is above 90%.\n> * Increases defense against cutting attacks by 15%.\n>\n> **Epic Rating Information:**\n> Durability: 455/455 Defense: 575 Movement Speed: -7%\n> * Reduces damage received by 45% if health is above 80%.\n> * Increases defense against cutting attacks by 20%.\n> * Small chance of invalidating cutting attacks.\n>\n> **Unique Rating Information:**\n> Durability: 493/493 Defense: 631 Movement Speed: -6%\n> * Reduces damage received by 50% if health is above 70%.\n> * Increases defense against cutting attacks by 25%.\n> * Certain chance of invalidating cutting attacks.\n>\n> **Legendary Rating Information:**\n> Durability: 574/574 Defense: 694 Movement Speed: -4%\n> * Reduces damage received by 60% if health is above 60%.\n> * Increases defense against cutting attacks by 30%.\n> * High chance of invalidating cutting attacks.\n>\n> Armor made of black iron.

He'd be stuck in the smithy, but frustration was the last thing he felt.\n\n*Anyway, I'm the best.*\n\nUnlike other rankers who had to rush around hunting, he could focus on making money and taking it easy. Grid settled into the feeling of seclusion, like a martial artist hermit in the mountains.\n\nMeanwhile, a long limousine pulled up in front of Shin Youngwoo's house.\n\nThe owner was someone Youngwoo knew all too well."
