  "content": "**[Protagonist of the Extremely Honorable Painting]**\n\n[* One-time limited skill.\n\nWhen activated, your stats and skills will revert to their state at the moment this painting was created.\n\nNote: Only stats and skills are affected. Titles, class, status, race, age, and other attributes remain unchanged.]\n\nThe new skill sat at the bottom of Grid's list, mocking him. For twenty days, it had been a splinter in his mind—a constant source of anxiety he couldn't dislodge.\n\nAt first, he'd been thrilled. Being immortalized in an extremely honorable painting was an honor in itself, and the skill it granted was essentially a save point. Like something out of a single-player RPG.\n\nThen the dread set in.\n\n\"It's like the system is warning me,\" Grid muttered, staring at the skill description. \"Something terrible is coming.\"\n\nThe logic was inescapable. Save points existed for one reason: catastrophic failure. The very existence of this skill suggested that somewhere down the line, he would face something he couldn't overcome on his own. Something that would break him completely.\n\nHis stomach churned. His eyes darkened.\n\n\"I don't know what's waiting for me...\"\n\nFear coiled in his chest. He was already tangled up in storylines involving gods and the Seven Malignant Saints—forces so far beyond him it was laughable to think he could compete.\n\n\"But then again,\" he said softly, \"nothing has ever been easy.\"\n\nThe Hexetia Temple was complete. Grid's trembling hands steadied as he placed the crown on his head before the completion ceremony. He'd walked this path before—when he was nobody hunting for Pagma's Rare Book, when he became a lord, when he fought a great demon, when he claimed his throne, when he cleansed Behen Archipelago.\n\nEvery step had been agony. Every victory had cost him.\n\nBut he'd endured. He'd survived. He'd grown stronger.\n\nA new trial might be waiting—but he was no longer the weak, desperate man who'd started this journey.\n\n*The save point is insurance,* Grid thought, straightening his shoulders. *I've fought without insurance this whole time. Now I'll be even stronger.*\n\nHe wouldn't stop. He would see how far he could go.\n\nWith that promise burning in his chest, Grid left his office and descended to the first floor. There, hanging in the castle's grand entrance hall where every visitor would see it first, was Picasso's masterpiece—the extremely honorable painting completed twenty days ago.\n\nGrid's expression twisted. Sweat beaded on his forehead.\n\n\"Why the hell did you hang it *here*?\" he demanded.\n\nLauel followed him down the stairs, utterly unbothered. \"Where else would we hang a portrait of the king? It's tradition.\"\n\n\"It's *embarrassing*.\" Grid's face flushed red. No matter how he looked at it, the painting made him far too handsome. Picasso had clearly idealized him. \"I don't want to catfish people...\"\n\n\"Catfish?\"\n\n\"You know—when someone's photos look amazing but in person they're... not. This is going to cause extreme levels of disappointment!\"\n\n\"Have you looked in a mirror lately?\" Lauel said flatly. \"There's no difference between you and the painting. Picasso just captured you at peak concentration. That's all.\"\n\n\"Stop talking.\"\n\nHow could he possibly look that good while concentrating? If that were true, would he have spent so many years single? Wouldn't women have lined up at his door?\n\nGrid shook his head and hurried forward. The temple's opening ceremony would begin soon, and he couldn't afford to be late.\n\n*I wonder how Hexetia will react...*\n\nThis was the blacksmith god's first temple. Grid hoped the deity would be pleased—that the gesture would ease his sense of alienation, restore his self-esteem, help him stop feeling so envious of the other gods.\n\n*And then,* Grid thought, *I'll be able to cleanse the First Holy Sword.*\n\nWith the goddess' blessing, he could push his blacksmithing to new heights.\n\n\"Attention!\"\n\n\"Protect King Grid—the sun of this kingdom!\"\n\nDozens of young knights snapped to attention and formed an escort around him. Only Coke was absent, waiting at the palace to help Prince Lord prepare.\n\n\"Make way for the King!\"\n\n\"The King approaches!\"\n\nSurrounded by his honor guard, Grid passed through a corridor formed by thousands of elite soldiers—all clad in mass-produced Grid sets forged by his kingdom's craftsmen. Tens of thousands of citizens lined the streets, watching the royal procession.\n\n*Thump. Thump. Thump.*\n\nGrid's heart pounded in his chest. The anxiety about future dangers faded, replaced by something stronger. Faith.\n\nHe wasn't alone anymore. He didn't have to rely solely on his own strength.\n\n*They protect me, just as I protect them.*\n\nThis wasn't a time for isolation. He was too weak to stand apart from everyone. But together—together, they were infinitely stronger.\n\n***\n\nCompared to the grand temples of Goddess Rebecca that dotted the continent, Hexetia's temple was modest. Rebecca's temples were enormous structures the size of megachurches; Hexetia's was more like a mountain shrine.\n\nBut no one could dismiss its quality.\n\nThe entire structure—exterior and interior—was crafted from the finest marble. Dozens of architects had collaborated on the design. Dozens of sculptors had worked tirelessly to recreate Hexetia's visage with reverent precision. Hammer and anvil motifs decorated every surface.\n\nThe crowning achievement stood outside: two statues placed side by side.\n\nThe five-meter-tall Hexetia was a perfect recreation of the god Grid had encountered. Beside him stood a seven-meter statue of Rebecca, her expression both dignified and compassionate. They were the finest sculptures Grid had ever seen.\n\nHe'd heard the sculptor had demanded an outrageous fee. But looking at them now... wasn't it worth it?\n\n[A temple of God Hexetia has been completed in Reinhardt, capital of the Overgeared Kingdom!]\n\n[This is the first temple ever dedicated to Hexetia!]\n\n[The artistic value of the statues—perfect recreations of God Hexetia and Goddess Rebecca—has pierced the heavens!]\n\n[These new monuments will enhance visitors' insights. All are encouraged to visit Reinhardt.]\n\nA world message?\n\n\"Wait, what?\" Grid stared at the notification, completely blindsided.\n\nMeanwhile, Lauel was practically vibrating with glee. \"Excellent! This will drive tourism through the roof! Everyone will come to see them, and they'll spend money while they're here! That vicious sculptor was worth every coin!\"\n\n\"You... you *planned* this?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Lauel said smugly. \"It's the first statue and temple of God Hexetia. Naturally it would become a tourist attraction—people will flock here just to see the blacksmith god. Didn't you expect this? You're a genius, after all.\"\n\n\"...\" Grid had expected no such thing, but he couldn't admit that now.\n\n\"WOOOOOOO!\"\n\n\"Reinhardt's culture is flourishing thanks to King Grid!\"\n\n\"King Grid! I love you!\"\n\n\"Holy shit... my Intelligence just went up by 10 from looking at the statue...\"\n\n\"My blacksmithing skill leveled up? That's incredible! Makes sense for a kingdom founded by a blacksmith, I guess.\"\n\nPlayers and NPCs alike erupted in celebration, their cheers echoing through Reinhardt's streets. Grid smiled despite himself.\n\n\"This is Reinhardt, capital of the Overgeared Kingdom! The temple and statue of God Hexetia, commissioned by Overgeared King Grid, are now open to the public...\"\n\n\"This brand-new temple will likely trigger numerous effects. Most visitors can expect Hexetia-related quests, along with various stat bonuses...\"\n\n\"Experts predict this could spawn entirely new classes—priests, paladins, or blacksmiths capable of wielding divine power.\"\n\nReporters from across the globe were already broadcasting live. They were deeply grateful to Grid—after all, he'd personally informed them of the timing, ensuring they could arrive early and capture the scoop in real time.\n\n*How did they all get here so fast?* Grid wondered. *Does every news station have a mage with Mass Teleport on payroll?*\n\nOf course, Grid didn't realize the truth: it wasn't him who'd tipped off the broadcasters.\n\nIt was Lauel.\n\n*I'll spread your legend to every corner of the world,* the aide thought gleefully.\n\n[You are the first human to construct a temple for God Hexetia!]\n\n[The gods—including Hexetia—are astonished.]\n\nHexetia had taken the bait. While the festival atmosphere swelled around him, Grid alone looked skyward as new notifications appeared.\n\n[Goddess of Light Rebecca smiles warmly upon you.]\n\n[The other gods remain silent, defended by the War God Zeratul's advocacy.]\n\n[The voice of Blacksmith God Hexetia reaches your ears.]\n\n—*Thank you.*\n\n[Affinity with God Hexetia has increased by 50!]\n\n—*But... I wonder. Can I truly trust a human who sees through my weaknesses and laughs behind my back? Will you serve me faithfully?*\n\n[God Hexetia harbors suspicions.]\n\n—*Are you honoring me out of respect? Or... do you even want me to be respected by humanity? Right now, these people seem to worship you more than they do my statue.*\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nA chill ran down Grid's spine. Something was wrong. Hexetia's tone wasn't grateful—it was paranoid. Bitter.\n\n[Affinity with God Hexetia has decreased to -10!]\n\nGrid had lost favor with a god suffering from crippling self-esteem issues—and now met the requirements to receive a divine curse.\n\n*This is insane!*\n\nEverything went dark.\n\n***\n\nIn the chairman's office at S.A. Group headquarters, Lim Cheolho smiled knowingly.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you?\" he murmured. \"The god's curse would be interesting.\"\n\n—*I challenge you to a duel!* Hexetia's voice thundered in Grid's ears.\n\n[★Hidden Quest★ 'Win a Blacksmithing Competition with a God' has begun.]"
