Grid pulled it out now, turning the small glass bottle in his hand.\n\n*Drevigo wouldn't have dropped something useless.*\n\nThis wasn't some random field boss. Drevigo had shaped Satisfy's narrative, the architect of the Rebecca Church's corruption. What were the odds that the liquid he'd dropped was ordinary water?\n\n*Zero.*\n\nThe name itself screamed significance. Grid's thoughts turned methodical. The unsealing of Lifael's Spear. Pascal's sudden appearance. The elders rallying to Pascal's banner.\n\nAll of it traced back to Drevigo.\n\n*The item he dropped has to be the solution.*\n\nThis was a game, after all. Final bosses always dropped the key to overcoming despair.\n\n\"Worth checking.\"\n\nGrid uncorked the bottle. A single drop fell onto Lifael's Spear.\n\n*Tok.*\n\nAdamantium met divine essence.\n\n*Swaaaah!*\n\nBrilliant blue light flooded the cramped room.\n\n\"Ah!\" Isabel gasped.\n\nGrid watched the radiance, then turned to her. A notification materialized before his eyes.\n\n> [The information about the Goddess' Essence has been updated.]\n\n***\n\nFive days. No word from Crow.\n\nKamiyan accepted the truth.\n\n*He's dead.*\n\nDenial had lasted through the first three days. Crow's skills were legendary. The possibility of failure seemed absurd. But by day five, reality became undeniable.\n\n*Idiot. All that confidence for nothing.*\n\nAt least the situation had clarified itself.\n\n*Grid's power matches mine. No question.*\n\nPerhaps exceeded it.\n\n*I need to be careful.*\n\nGrid hadn't announced the assassination attempt. No proclamations, no accusations. A calculated silence while he identified the culprit.\n\n*I thought he was a fool when he humiliated Pascal and the elders. Turns out he's a fox.*\n\nA dangerous combination. Individual strength paired with political cunning and the church's praise.\n\n*Pascal's bribery attempts fail daily. We can't let this drag out.*\n\nKamiyan's gaze drifted to the window. Outside, Damian and Huroi conducted their campaign. Relentless.\n\n*Especially that Huroi...*\n\nThe man's oratory was extraordinary. He'd seized the hearts of church members with disturbing speed. Even some of Pascal's purchased priests now wavered toward Damian. Huroi could call excrement medicine and they'd believe him.\n\n*I'll handle this myself.*\n\nOne week remained. The grand speech, held exactly thirty days before the papal election. All pope candidates would address the Rebecca Church's continental priesthood and assembled nobility.\n\nEarl Chirita of the Saharan Empire would attend. Pascal's father operated differently than his son. He eliminated risks preemptively.\n\n*I need his backing to strike at Grid.*\n\nKamiyan acknowledged Grid's superior individual strength. But Grid's total force was pathetic. One dying Rebecca's Daughter, Damian, and the orator Huroi. Simple enough to crush if Kamiyan allied with Earl Chirita's resources.\n\n***\n\n> **[Goddess' Essence]**\n>\n> A liquid containing Goddess Rebecca's divine power.\n>\n> To ordinary people: simple water.\n> \n> To wielders of black magic: poison.\n> \n> To goddess servants: a miracle drug.\n>\n> When mixed with minerals, it maximizes viscosity and enhances unique properties. Injects divine power.\n>\n> Weight: 0.1\n\n*Maximizes viscosity? Like clay?*\n\nThe secret of the spear's construction revealed itself.\n\n> [Your understanding of Lifael's Spear has increased by 40%.]\n>\n> [You have discovered the item's hidden secret! A great achievement!]\n>\n> [Insight has increased by 30.]\n>\n> [Intelligence has increased by 30.]\n>\n> [The Legendary Blacksmith's Appraisal skill has improved. Observing items now increases understanding faster.]\n\n\"Damn. That's good.\"\n\nGrid grinned. The Goddess' Essence's purpose, the spear's joining mechanism, and stat bonuses all at once.\n\n*Even better.*\n\nHe looked at Isabel. Color had returned to her face. The resonance between essence and spear had produced a healing effect.\n\n*Save Isabel first.*\n\nPriority one. She needed health to survive separation from Lifael's Spear.\n\n*Then I can begin disassembly and reassembly.*\n\nMission parameters established. Grid stood and offered the bottle to Isabel, whose eyes widened in wonder.\n\n\"Drink it.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Isabel said.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It's too precious.\"\n\n\"You're dying. Just drink.\"\n\n\"I won't.\"\n\n\"Why are you being difficult? One drop.\"\n\nGrid ran the math. One milliliter of essence. Twenty drops per milliliter. Isabel's condition had improved from mere resonance with a single drop. Direct consumption would heal her completely.\n\nHe was certain. But Isabel's stubbornness held firm.\n\n\"I appreciate the offer. But I can't be indebted to you anymore.\"\n\n\"It's just one drop.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nFive days of conversation in this room had taught Isabel something she couldn't ignore. Grid was married. She couldn't allow these feelings to continue. Suppressing them required distance. Refusing his kindness was the first step.\n\nGrid shrugged as she bowed her head. \"You're misunderstanding me, Isabel.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"I helped you because it benefits me. Not from unconditional kindness. So stop overthinking this and drink. I have work to do.\"\n\nThe blunt honesty left Isabel unable to refuse.\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nShe accepted the bottle with trembling hands. Raised it toward her lips. Hesitated, worried about accidentally consuming multiple drops.\n\n*She's become so timid.*\n\nIsabel had been willful once. Spirited. But Drevigo and Pascal had broken something in her. Used her as a tool, not a person. Sentenced her to death. Those words, repeated endlessly, had transformed her.\n\nPoor kid.\n\nGrid sighed and took the bottle back. He placed a single drop on his fingertip and brought it to Isabel's mouth.\n\n\"Lick.\"\n\n\"Eh...\"\n\nRed flooded her face. A man's finger. He wanted her to lick it. Her thoughts tangled into knots.\n\n\"Do I really need to feed you like a child?\"\n\nGrid pressed his finger between Isabel's lips.\n\n\"Hah...!\"\n\nCombined with title bonuses, Grid's dexterity exceeded 2,300. Isabel shuddered as his finger entered her mouth. Sensations she'd never experienced ignited through her body, making her dizzy.\n\nThe thick, firm digit touched her uvula...\n\n[Content omitted by the author.]\n\n***\n\n\"Hah... hah...\"\n\nIsabel collapsed onto the bed, drained. Warm blue light enveloped her body. The Goddess' Essence took effect immediately. Her platinum hair regained its lustrous shine. Rough skin smoothed into translucent perfection.\n\n\"Really pretty. Now you just need to regain some weight.\"\n\nIsabel's face burned redder at the compliment. She covered her face with both hands, breathing hard. Grid frowned.\n\n*Something's off about her condition.*\n\nHer health was recovering. So why did she look more exhausted?\n\n*Dok. Dok dok.*\n\nA homing pigeon rapped against the window before Grid could puzzle it out. He retrieved Irene's letter, then lifted Lifael's Spear.\n\n\"There's a smithy here. I'm going to work. You rest.\"\n\n\"Yes...\"\n\nIsabel watched him through her fingers, eyes wet and eager. The expression reminded him of Irene in their bed.\n\n*Gulp.*\n\nGrid swallowed hard, banishing the inappropriate thought.\n\n*The healing process must be... pleasant.*\n\nHe left the room quickly.\n\n\"Nyang.\"\n\nNoe sunbathed on the corridor windowsill. Grid looked at the cat rolling on his plump belly with disgust.\n\n\"Tsk tsk. I gave you a job and you're just sleeping.\"\n\nGrid remained unaware of the assassin from five days ago. Pity for Noe.\n\n> [White Transformation is activated.]\n>\n> [You have no divine power. White Transformation has failed. Side effects will occur.]\n>\n> [You have resisted.]\n\nThe notifications continued their parade.\n\nGrid stopped in the garden before heading to the smithy. He set down Lifael's Spear, settled onto a bench, and opened the letter.\n\n> *I can feel the child moving in my belly. Each day brings new wonder. I want to share this happiness with you soon, dear husband. What do you want our child to be interested in when they grow up?*\n\n> [Answer your wife's question. This will affect the child's abilities after birth.]\n>\n> * I want the child interested in martial arts.\n> * I want the child interested in magic.\n> * I want the child interested in learning.\n> * I want the child interested in theology.\n> * I want the child interested in techniques.\n> * I just want the child healthy.\n\n*Not theology.*\n\nDrevigo and Pascal had soured him on religion permanently.\n\n*Not health either. The kid might end up like Jude.*\n\nAmong the remaining options, one stood out.\n\n*Techniques.*\n\nHis child could become the estate's craftsman. Grid wrote his reply, professing his love for Irene before answering her question.\n\n*I'll visit once I finish here.*\n\nHe tied the letter to the pigeon's leg.\n\n*Kwaduduk.*\n\nThe bird took flight toward the southwest. Winston's direction. Grid watched it disappear.\n\nFootsteps approached from behind.\n\n***"
