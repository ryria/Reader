  "content": "After the Fourth National Competition, Kraugel imposed a brutal constraint upon himself: for three years, he could not stray from Kirinus' side. The restriction obliterated his freedom of movement—a penalty that would have crippled any other player.\n\nRain or shine, through blizzards and heatwaves, Kraugel remained. A ramshackle hut on an unremarkable mountain became the boundaries of his entire world. While other players roamed the continent, conquering dungeons and accumulating achievements, Kraugel's level stagnated.\n\nBut stagnation was an illusion. Every lesson with Kirinus nourished his growth in ways statistics couldn't capture. When he finally completed the quest, his Sword Saint class bloomed into something transcendent. He obtained the Heart Sword—a technique lacking the spectacular flourish of Space Sword, yet embodying the very essence of why the Sword Saint stood supreme.\n\n**[Heart Sword - First Entrance]**  \n**[Strike the target with the sword of will.**  \n**Deals damage equivalent to 10% of the target's current health and causes critical damage.**  \n***It isn't affected by the user's attack power or the target's defense.**  \n**Skill Resource Consumption: Half of maximum sword energy.**  \n**Skill Cooldown Time: 24 hours.**  \n**Skill Health Consumption: 10%]**\n\nAt first, Kraugel was devastated. The damage seemed pathetic given the exorbitant cost and crushing cooldown. What kind of ultimate skill was *this* weak? He'd genuinely suspected a bug.\n\nThen came the revelation.\n\nThrough rigorous testing, Kraugel uncovered why Muller had once faced down Great Demons alone. The Heart Sword was *guaranteed*. The instant Kraugel willed his blade to cut, the target was severed—no warning, no tell, no counterplay. Even Kirinus, a transcendent named NPC, couldn't avoid it. Which meant boss monsters were equally vulnerable. Eventually, when the skill evolved beyond its initial stage, it would claim its place among Satisfy's most devastating techniques.\n\n*Since you've shown your hand, it's only fair I show mine.*\n\nOriginally, he'd planned to unveil this power during their inevitable rematch, or when dire necessity demanded it. Instead, Kraugel revealed it now, with the entire world watching. That was his code. Grid had exposed his strength—courtesy demanded reciprocation.\n\n> **[The sword of will is aimed at the target.]**\n\n\"...?\"\n\n> **[The target has received 290,654,000 damage.]**  \n**[Percentage-based damage does not contribute to achievement calculations.]**\n\nBerith's shoulder *exploded*.\n\nThe Great Demon stood frozen, shock rendering him utterly speechless.\n\n\"...!\"  \n\"...!\"  \n\"...!\"\n\nGrid and the dukes recoiled, eyes bulging. Grid stared at Kraugel like he'd witnessed a ghost. That single strike had dealt damage comparable to what Grid had inflicted over *several minutes*. \n\nThe global audience erupted. Cutting a target with mere *words*? Dealing hundreds of millions of damage to the Great Demon who'd slaughtered tens of thousands of rankers? The feeds descended into chaos.\n\n\"I simply had a good opponent.\" Kraugel's expression remained casual, almost bored. \"It's nothing compared to the power of your sword dances.\"\n\n\"What...?\"\n\nGrid's tongue clicked. Was Kraugel *seriously* playing humble right now? The audacity almost felt like mockery. Then understanding crashed over him, and Grid found himself laughing helplessly, his hands trembling.\n\nOverwhelming joy surged through him. His rival was *healthy*. Kraugel was climbing back toward the summit where he belonged...\n\n*Yes. This is right.*\n\nGrid felt something ease in his chest—a tension he hadn't realized he'd been carrying.\n\n*Let's keep pushing forward. Together.*\n\n\"...I like that reaction.\"\n\nKraugel smiled, reading every emotion flickering through Grid's gaze. In that moment, they both understood an immutable truth: they *needed* each other. If one fell, the other would be left wandering in unbearable solitude.\n\n*You.*  \n*You.*  \n*You are my guide.*  \n*You are my goal.*\n\nSuper Sensitivity blazed to life. Grid's transcendent speed became the catalyst, launching Kraugel directly into Berith's guard.\n\n\"Crying Tiger.\"\n\nThe Sword Saint's technique pierced through the reflexively forming metal walls.\n\n\"...\"\n\nBerith's torso caved inward, but no blood spilled. His health gauge barely flickered—Kraugel's damage fell within conventional parameters, unlike Grid's monstrous output. A normal skill couldn't truly wound Berith. But it *did* shatter his stance, and that was enough.\n\nKraugel's strength wasn't rooted in raw stats. It was insight. Control. Precision.\n\n\"Earth Dragon's Ascension.\"\n\nThe strike caught Berith's chin mid-recovery, forcing him momentarily away from his metal barrier. The blade slipped through a centimeter-wide gap, drawing blood—minimal damage, but *damage*. Berith's claws raked across Kraugel's chest in retaliation.\n\n> **[You have suffered 31,500 damage.]**\n\n\"*Die!*\"\n\n\"Guh...!\"\n\nTheir exchange intensified. Berith was weakened from escaping Hell—that much was obvious. Grid had penetrated his defenses through the combination of Blackening and transcendent senses. But while diminished, Berith wasn't helpless. Against Kraugel's Super Sensitivity, he could still react.\n\nSparks flew as the White Tiger Sword clashed with demonic claws. Kraugel appeared to be losing ground. That was the feint.\n\n\"...!\"\n\nThe White Tiger Sword's weight *tripled* in an instant, buckling Berith's posture. Simultaneously, chains and cloth whipped out, binding the demon's remaining arm. The Hao siblings had intervened. Russian rankers unleashed their ultimate techniques in a coordinated bombardment.\n\n\"*Insignificant insects!*\"\n\nBerith *wrenched* his arm, flinging the siblings through the air. They recovered smoothly—Mei Xiao discarded the cloth and lashed out with her whip while Hao transformed into a half-draconian and expelled a stream of flames.\n\nKraugel capitalized on every precious second his teammates bought him. Strike after calculated strike exposed Berith's vulnerabilities, each technique methodically stripping away defensive layers. He'd done his part—setting the stage for the true powerhouses.\n\n\"Free Farming Peak Style!\"\n\nA colossal shadow materialized above Berith's head as Kraugel's party kept him occupied.\n\n\"True Clouds!\"\n\nKraugel disengaged, summoning dense blue fog that swallowed the battlefield. The clouds spread like living things, smothering Berith's vision and spatial awareness.\n\n\"Pounding Mortar.\"\n\n\"*This—!*\"\n\nBerith's annoyance crystallized into alarm. Above him loomed one of humanity's most devastating techniques—power that even a Great Demon couldn't dismiss.\n\n\"*Don't underestimate me!*\"\n\nThe blue clouds instantly calcified into solid metal. Kraugel's debuff transformed into a massive umbrella shielding Berith from above.\n\n'Damn!'\n\nPiaro's expression hardened. That defense would significantly weaken Pounding Mortar. But unlike the Belial raid—where he'd fought alone while protecting Grid and the Overgeared members—he now had allies. Grid had reunited him with his former comrades.\n\n\"Sir Piaro! We've got this!\"\n\n\"I'm not the novice I once was!\"\n\nGrenhal and Morse joined the assault. They couldn't unleash their berserker or beast transformations due to political complications, but even restrained, they could shatter Berith's alchemy. The umbrella casting its shadow over the ground splintered beneath Grenhal's flying sword and Morse's phantom strike. Sunlight pierced the artificial darkness.\n\n\"*I said—don't take me lightly!*\"\n\nBerith's focus shifted to 'her.' Metal fragments reassembled in real-time. Darkness consumed the world once more.\n\nThen came the variable.\n\n\"I'll break it.\"\n\nBasara's eyes ignited with crimson light—the red energy inherent to the imperial bloodline. Haicyen Saharan's power, passed down from history's mightiest emperor. Red energy could penetrate matter itself, strengthening or corroding at will. This was why the Red Knights wore crimson armor.\n\nThe metal umbrella aged a thousand years in seconds, rusting and crumbling.\n\nImpact.\n\nPerfect timing. Before Berith could reconstruct his defense, the mortar *crushed* his torso. Beneath the umbrella's shadow, Berith's body crumpled at an unnatural angle.\n\nWhite blood pooled like a river. Then massive metal vines erupted, ensnaring Piaro, Kraugel, and the dukes.\n\n\"Guh...!?\"\n\nThe damage was negligible, but the vines *bound* them physically.\n\n*The more I learn about him, the more dangerous he seems.*\n\nMorse's worldview shifted. He'd always believed the Saharan Empire stood invincible—that Great Demons might ravage humanity, but the Empire would endure. Just as Astaroth had fallen in the imperial palace, surely no demon could threaten their might.\n\nBut now, bound by these magic-reinforced vines, doubt crept in.\n\n*Without transforming, I can't break free...*\n\nHis mind conjured a nightmare: Berith invading Titan. Every substance in the capital transforming into hostile metal, attacking citizens and soldiers alike. Could the Empire truly survive?\n\nThe Grandmaster was an unknown variable—he'd likely ignore the dying masses, interested only in experimental subjects. Goldhit was similarly unreliable.\n\n*Bain would only defend the Emperor. At best, Kyle and Chensler would respond.*\n\nCould two dukes stop Berith? Possibly. Kyle had grown tremendously powerful, and Chensler literally couldn't die. Together, they might defeat Berith after days of fighting. But by then, the capital's citizens would be corpses. Unless *all* seven dukes defended Titan simultaneously, the devastation would be catastrophic.\n\n*Dammit!*\n\nMorse finally understood his folly—how he'd dismissed the Great Demon threat as someone else's problem. This demon had to die. Here. Now.\n\n*King Grid... thank you.*\n\nHe prepared to transform, political consequences be damned. Protecting humanity mattered more than the Empire's strategic positioning. His gratitude toward Grid burned fierce—this hero who transcended national boundaries to fight for all mankind. Thanks to Grid's foresight, they could eliminate a potential apocalypse before it reached the Empire's doorstep.\n\nMorse's muscles began swelling as he gripped the vines around his throat. Silver hair started bristling along his skin.\n\nThen yellow flames crashed like a tsunami, melting the metal restraints. Everyone, including Morse, regained their freedom instantly.\n\n\"Duke Basara, you must guard the rear. Only *then* can your red energy handle these sudden variables. What good are you if you're caught in the crossfire?\"\n\nSpear Saint Rachel—whose strength matched Morse's beast form—had finally stepped forward. The woman who'd remained silent throughout the battle had just saved them all.\n\n\"That mistake was beneath you. What got you so excited that you'd risk yourself?\" She turned her sharp gaze on Morse. \"And *you*. What were you thinking, about to reveal your transformation?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Do you *want* to broadcast that you're dumber than a dog in beast form?\"\n\n\"I'm a *wolf*, not a dog.\"\n\n\"Whatever.\"\n\nRachel's attention shifted to Piaro. After lingering in the background since Grid's arrival, she'd finally claimed the spotlight. Unaware that billions of eyes watched her every move, she spoke:\n\n\"Piaro, former Captain of the Red Knights. I didn't know you served the Overgeared King.\"\n\n『...!』  \n—...!\n\n\"Though... I knew you were alive. Who could possibly harm *you*—my hero, the Empire's greatest?\"\n\n『...!?』  \n—...!?\n\n*The insane farmer of the Overgeared Kingdom was the Empire's GREATEST?* So great that Spear Saint Rachel called him her *hero*?\n\nGlobal viewers spat out their beer and soda in shock. One Korean viewer choked on chicken, tears streaming down his face. Eating kimchi with fried chicken really *was* dangerous...\n\n『Grid, who was at war with the Empire not long ago, arrived with the Empire's dukes... The mystery finally makes sense...』\n\nGoosebumps rippled through the audience. Grid's subordinate was formerly the Empire's apex. When had Grid used Piaro to engineer a rapprochement with the Empire? Perhaps he'd planned this *years* ago, when the Emperor first extended his invitation? This wasn't merely thinking two or three steps ahead. Grid's foresight had transcended into precognition.\n\n*Gulp.*\n\nThe commentators' nervous swallows transmitted through speakers and headsets worldwide. No one could tear their eyes from Grid, who simply sat resting, seemingly oblivious to the revelation.\n\nMeanwhile, Grid silently rejoiced.\n\n> **[The duration of Truth Distortion has ended.]**  \n**[Lost classes, titles, and skills have been restored.]**  \n**[However, since Magic Swordsman of the Epics holds higher status than Pagma's Descendant, Grid's Swordsmanship remains active.]**"
