  "content": "System notifications blazed across Grid's vision:\n\n> [The Sword Aiming at the Gods was born after being smelted and forged in Asgard: First World.]\n> [The energy of Asgard: First World is released from the Sword Aiming at the Gods.]\n> [Golden clouds have appeared!]\n> [The golden clouds will be the bridge between you and Asgard: First World.]\n\nGrid's eyes widened. Descending from the heavens, clouds of pure gold materialized—layered like stairs climbing into eternity itself. An invitation to ascend.\n\n\"Oh...! By the Goddess...!\"\n\n\"A bridge to heaven itself...!\"\n\nGasps rippled through the assembled Rebecca Church members. The elders stared between Grid and the celestial stairway, their expressions torn between reverence and fear. This was vindication—proof that their lifelong devotion to the divine had meaning, that the gods they worshipped truly existed beyond the mortal veil.\n\n> [The appearance of the golden clouds has amplified the morale of all those who serve the gods. During the three minute summoning time of the golden clouds, all those who serve a god will have their attack and defense increased by 10%.]\n> [Everyone who doesn't serve a god will feel terrified by the golden clouds. During the three minute summoning time of the golden clouds, their attack and defense will decrease by 10%.]\n> [You serve multiple gods, so your attack power and defense have increased by 10%.]\n\nGrid's shoulders slumped. So that was it.\n\nA global buff. A global debuff. He'd hoped for devastation—something like the black flames' explosive annihilation. Instead, he got... morale adjustment. Worse, the skill made no distinction between ally and enemy. His Overgeared members had visited the Hexetia Temple recently, meaning they served at least one god. But what about other players? Most had probably joined a religion by now. Even without specialized classes like paladins or priests, anyone could receive this buff.\n\nThe tactical nightmare unfolded in his mind. On a battlefield, the golden clouds could swing entire wars depending on religious demographics. The Saharan Empire alone had the Rebecca Church as its state religion.\n\n'Shit. At least I can mitigate the damage by making everyone serve the Hexetia Temple...'\n\nStill. Disappointing. After the overwhelming power he'd gained from the Astaroth raid, the golden clouds felt... underwhelming.\n\nThen came another notification.\n\n> [The baby angels at the other end of the golden clouds touching the highest heaven are reaching out. The angels have a great interest in the ground. However, they can't come down to the ground because they know the summoning time of the golden clouds is short.]\n> [The linked skill of the golden clouds, Angel's Aria, has failed to activate.]\n\nGrid blinked. Angel's Aria? The young angels he'd met in the divine realm flashed through his memory. So the golden clouds weren't just buffs—they were a platform. A gateway. His disappointment evaporated, replaced by anticipation.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nDamian lay on the scorched ground, fists clenched against the stones. Defeat. The word tasted like ash. Every time he faced Grid in combat, the gap between admiration and humiliation widened. He respected Grid more than anyone alive, yet losing—again and always again—denied the value of every hour he'd spent training.\n\n'Even setting my pride aside, this is a problem. Grid must be so disappointed in me.'\n\nTime had passed. Damian had grown stronger. But compared to Grid? He still seemed weak. Inadequate. Despite being the pope, he felt like a child playing at adulthood. He wanted to prove himself. To demonstrate that his efforts hadn't been wasted. Time was equal to everyone, after all. Just as Grid had fought through countless trials since the 3rd National Competition, so had Damian. He shouldn't fall so easily.\n\nPushing himself up from the burned earth, Damian ignored the 10% buff from Grid's golden clouds. Grid likely had the same advantage. Relying on it would be pointless.\n\n\"Goddess' Breath.\"\n\nPure light enveloped him. His health surged to maximum.\n\nGrid's eyebrows rose. \"You still want to continue?\"\n\nThis wasn't the Damian who'd started this duel with resignation already written across his face. Where had that warrior gone? The one who'd stood against the corrupted Pope Drevigo, against Piaro the farmer, against Kraugel himself—the sky above the sky? That man's conviction had burned like an eternal flame.\n\nBut somewhere along the path to becoming pope, Damian had changed. The weight of ecclesiastical authority had begun to matter more than personal faith. Pride had withered under the excuse of \"protecting the church.\" Even today's spar reflected that decay. Years ago, Damian would have been thrilled just to fight. Now he'd only wanted to avoid embarrassment in front of Isabel, showing no genuine drive to overcome Grid's strength.\n\nGrid had grown. Damian had grown weaker. The realization left a bitter taste. In some ways, Damian's change could be viewed as maturity—as wisdom. But to Grid, it felt like watching a bonfire slowly dim to embers.\n\nYet now...\n\n\"I will continue.\" Damian's voice rang clear. \"It might be one-sided, but what kind of friend would I be if I didn't at least make you work for it?\" \n\nHe tore off the cumbersome white vestments that marked his papal office.\n\n\"Your Holiness!\" The elders recoiled, scandalized. Casting aside sacred garments in front of the entire congregation—the impropriety!\n\nThe old Damian would have scratched his head and laughed sheepishly. This Damian met their glares head-on. \"It's uncomfortable. I can't fight properly while wearing ceremonial robes. What am I supposed to do when the fabric catches on my armor every time I move?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Please respect the fact that unlike other popes, I am a paladin. Not a priest.\"\n\nMore silence.\n\n\"Or did you forget? The first pope fought in full armor when sealing Marie Rose—not vestments.\"\n\nThe elders' mouths snapped shut. Satisfaction bloomed in Damian's chest as he leveled his sword at Grid. One minute and ten seconds remained on his buffs.\n\n\"I'm going to use everything I have.\"\n\nNo more worrying about the congregation's judgment. No more performing for Isabel's sake. This fight was for him. He would cast aside papal dignity if that's what it took.\n\nReading the determination blazing in Damian's eyes, Grid smiled. \"Good. Come, Damian.\"\n\nFour hammers materialized in Grid's hands—the Mjolnirs, each capable of inflicting stiffness on impact. The Ultimate Enhanced version gleamed among them. Grid's mind raced with possibility. Could the God Hands created by the Sword Aiming at the Gods equip items?\n\nThe answer came immediately. His new God Hands seized the hammers without issue. Relief flooded through him. If they couldn't wear equipment, they'd be worthless compared to the original versions.\n\nPerfect.\n\nGrid activated the pulling device. The Blade Aiming at the Gods detached and was replaced by the Enlightenment Blade. Black flames wreathed the legendary sword in his grip while the God Hands and the Blade circled him like satellites.\n\n'If I can time my defensive magic correctly, I have an opening.' Damian steadied his breathing, refusing to be intimidated by Grid's absurd arsenal.\n\nThe God Hands lunged. Damian knew a single hammer blow would end the fight, so he conjured a constellation of small light shields throughout the air—barriers to intercept the God Hands' trajectories. The Blade Aiming at the Gods streaked toward him. Not this time. He twisted, creating an opening as his sword swept up in a counterattack—\n\n\"Drop.\"\n\nGrid used the fastest activation among Pagma's Swordsmanship. No holding back. This was respect. This was acknowledging Damian as a true opponent. This was his full power.\n\nDamian's enormous square shield intercepted the blow as though he'd read Grid's mind before the skill even activated.\n\n> [The Square Divine Light Shield has absorbed the powerful shock!]\n> [The durability of the Square Divine Light Shield has decreased by 67.]\n> [Your left hand holding a shield has been paralyzed temporarily.]\n> [You have overcome the paralysis with your high status resistance.]\n\nDamian grunted, teeth clenched. Sixty-seven durability. In a single exchange. The shield meant to absorb damage had just hemorrhaged double-digit points from one attack. Was it even functioning properly?\n\nLight flashed from the magic circle hovering above Damian's shoulder. Beams lanced out, striking the God Hands and the Blade repeatedly. The God Hands stiffened under the barrage.\n\nBut the Blade Aiming at the Gods moved as though the light didn't exist, cutting through Damian's defense and drawing blood. The illusion of a fair duel shattered. This wasn't one versus one. It was one versus two.\n\nThen came the real problem.\n\n\"100,000 Army Massacre Sword.\"\n\nDamian was strong. That was his mistake. Over the years, the gap between him and Grid hadn't closed—it had widened. Not because Damian lacked effort or proper mindset. The problem was Grid's title: Hero King. The stronger Damian became, the more fighting energy he generated for Grid. Every clash, every bout of strength—they all fed Grid's exponential growth.\n\n> [The Square Divine Light Shield has absorbed the powerful shock!]\n> [The durability of the Square Divine Light Shield has decreased by 35.]\n> [The durability of the Square Divine Light Shield has decreased by 31.]\n> [The durability of the Square Divine Light Shield has decreased by 39.]\n> [The durability of the Square Divine Light Shield has decreased by 20.]\n> [The durability of the Square Divine Light Shield has decreased...]\n> [Warning! The durability of the Square Divine Light Shield has reached its limit!]\n\nThe onslaught didn't stop. Couldn't stop.\n\n> [The Square Divine Light Shield has been destroyed!]\n\nThe shield that had protected Damian through countless battles cracked like glass before crumbling to ash.\n\n\"Pope's Charity! Goddess' Protection!\" Damian simultaneously cast healing and shielding skills, desperation bleeding into his voice.\n\n\"Linked Kill.\"\n\nThe critical strike hammered through Damian's defenses like divine judgment. His health plummeted to a single point. The system announced his defeat.\n\nDamian collapsed to his knees, gasping. Shadows fell across his face as shame threatened to crush him. Was he even qualified to stand beside Grid as an equal? To call himself Grid's colleague?\n\nThen—\n\n> [You have heard Goddess Rebecca's warm voice.]\n> -You, my agent, need to become stronger.\n\nDamian's unique class shifted. Changed. Evolved.\n\n> [The goddess of light is the pinnacle of all gods and thinks that you, as the Goddess' Agent, also needs to be at the pinnacle.]\n> [The goddess has witnessed your many defeats against the same opponent and feels terrible enough to make a trial.]\n> [The class quest 'To Truly become the Goddess' Agent...' has been created.]\n\nDamian stared at the notifications. What condition had he met? Whether Grid intended it or not, shouldn't Damian be grateful?\n\n\"Good fight. That was genuinely fun.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nDamian looked up from the grass. Grid stood silhouetted against the sun, hand extended. But there was no pity in those eyes. Only pride. Grid had won decisively—overwhelmingly—yet he acknowledged Damian. Not with dismissal or disappointment, but with respect.\n\nDamian's grip tightened on the grass. Grid looked like he'd descended from heaven itself. Every single time, this person lifted him up. Grid existed as though fate had created him specifically to save Damian.\n\n\"You... You truly...\" The words wouldn't come. The emotions surging through Damian's chest choked off speech. His eyes burned.\n\nGrid froze. 'Is he... crying?' The beautiful young man's eyes glistened with unshed tears.\n\n\"W-What is it? Look, I'm sorry. I'll obviously reimburse you for the shield. I'll make something far better. So please calm—\"\n\nDamian surged to his feet and threw his arms around Grid in a crushing embrace.\n\n\"W-What?!\" Grid tried to pull away from the pretty man hugging him.\n\nDamian clung like a barnacle. \"I'm so grateful! Grid, you're the best!!\"\n\n\"L-Let go!\"\n\nHundreds of Rebecca Church followers watched. Players recorded everything. And Damian—the pope himself—was confessing his admiration while embracing the Overgeared King. Grid's stomach dropped. Was Damian deliberately embarrassing him as revenge for the destroyed shield?\n\nThat evening...\n\n> [Pope Damian's Confession of Love to the Overgeared King!]\n> [Damian's Worship of Grid—Private Feelings?]\n> [Grid the Homewrecker: Inside Sources Report Damian 'Obsessed']\n\nMedia outlets worldwide exploded with headlines. Women's magazines salivated over the gossip. Grid was an undisputed international celebrity—every action he took became a story. The most popular star who'd remained consistently famous since his public debut!\n\nUnfortunately...\n\n\"Goddammit. This is annoying.\" Grid scrolled through article after article, watching his Anti-Fans cafe membership skyrocket as rumors painted him as a garbage playboy.\n\n'Well, whatever. I learned a lot from sparring with Damian. Not a total loss.'\n\nGrid decided to keep both the hammers and the Blade Aiming at the Gods for now. The exponential increase in production capability was too valuable to discard, and the blade's versatility wasn't significantly worse than the God Hands. He had other problems to worry about.\n\n\"How can I secure more pavranium?\"\n\nMore pavranium clearly meant more power. But where could he find it?\n\n\"...Huh.\" Grid paused mid-thought. His clone. The one in hell."
