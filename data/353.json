Your health has fallen to the minimum, so sparring mode is finished!]\n\nKraugel had reigned at the top since Satisfy's launch. The sky above the sky.\n\n*I lost.*\n\nHe'd just fought Piaro. His condition was poor, his items damaged. Disadvantages, all of them. Flimsy excuses.\n\n*I lost to his effort.*\n\nNo. Kraugel didn't make excuses. If he'd indulged in self-pity every time he tasted defeat, he never would have reached this height in the first place.\n\nThe blue sky darkened overhead. Clouds gathered like mourners at a funeral, and rain began to fall.\n\n\"Ku... ock!\"\n\nBlood seeped through Kraugel's armor. He met Grid's eyes, his vision swimming. His knees buckled.\n\nGrid lunged forward and caught him.\n\n\"Be careful.\"\n\nKraugel blinked. \"...?\"\n\n\"You'll die if you fall from this height.\" Grid's voice was flat, matter-of-fact. He tightened his grip, his own body trembling with exhaustion.\n\nA laugh bubbled up from Kraugel's throat. His head came to rest against Grid's shoulder. \"I'm thankful. You saved my life.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Grid grunted under the weight. \"You would've lost experience otherwise.\"\n\n\"Yes. Thanks to you, I can keep my number one ranking.\"\n\n\"Protect that position until I take it from you.\"\n\nKraugel's lips quirked. \"That means I'll have to play for a hundred years.\"\n\n\"...It won't take that long.\"\n\nGrid had changed. Constant exercise had burned away the excess fat, revealing the strong frame beneath. His eyebrows were thick, his nose sharp and prominent. Now in his late twenties, maturity had settled into his features. He radiated a rugged, masculine charm.\n\nKraugel was different. His beauty was almost ethereal, a neutral elegance that defied easy categorization. Stubborn eyes contrasted with fine, pale skin. His black hair fell in artful disarray.\n\nThe two men, supporting each other as they descended, created an image that stirred something in the women watching below.\n\nJishuka pressed a hand to her chest. *To think I'd feel jealous of a man.*\n\nYura's fingers curled into fists. *I can't keep up anymore.*\n\nRuby's thoughts took a dangerous turn. *Maybe it's better if he's with a man instead of some random woman...*\n\nGrid and Kraugel touched down. For a moment, they simply stared at each other, surrounded by the Overgeared members.\n\n*If we fought again, could I win?*\n\n*I don't want to make an enemy of him.*\n\nThe jealousy was gone. Grid felt only awe when he looked at Kraugel now. Was it the magnanimity of a victor? No. This was purer than that. Respect, genuine and complete. Kraugel had driven him to the defensive with nothing but a normal class and overwhelming skill. Grid was grateful to have met him.\n\nKraugel felt the same. Grid possessed talent that seemed impossible given his humble origins. The effort required to overcome such a starting deficit, the years of struggle and growth... it commanded respect.\n\nKraugel straightened. \"How do you find time to grow? You have status, family, colleagues. Obligations.\"\n\nGrid tilted his head. \"Is it possible to grow alone? I can't do that.\"\n\n\"...I think we're talking about different concepts of growth.\" Kraugel paused. \"But I understand.\"\n\nHe rose fully. The rain stopped as abruptly as it had begun, and sunlight broke through the clouds. A smile crossed his face.\n\n\"It looks good.\"\n\nThe Overgeared members crowded around Grid. Rankers, every one of them. Baby Lord toddled forward on unsteady legs. Ruby pushed through. Piaro stood at the edge of the group. Dozens of eyes, all fixed on Grid. Worried. Proud. Protective.\n\nKraugel recognized the expression in those gazes. He understood, with sudden clarity, how much they cared.\n\nHe'd always believed he had to be the best. To get ahead of everyone else. Alone, moving quickly.\n\nGrid showed him a different path.\n\n\"I'll see you again someday.\" Kraugel turned to leave.\n\nGrid caught his arm. \"Stop by the smithy first. I'll repair your items.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be in your debt.\"\n\n\"You'll pay for materials and labor, won't you? Then it's not a debt.\" Grid tugged him forward. \"Come on.\"\n\nKraugel allowed himself to be led.\n\n***\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\nJishuka voiced the question on everyone's mind. How had the first-ranked Kraugel come to Reidan? Why had he and Grid clashed?\n\nPiaro stepped forward. \"That...\"\n\nHe explained everything. The Overgeared members listened with growing excitement.\n\n*Kraugel is close to Piaro?*\n\n*Does this mean...*\n\n*Could Kraugel join Overgeared?*\n\nIf that happened, their guild's power would skyrocket. A true jackpot.\n\n***\n\n**[+8 White Clouds Clothing]**\n\n**Rating:** Unique (Set)\n\n**Durability:** 150/389 | **Defense:** 317+168\n\n* Overall speed +5 + 1.5%\n* Evasion rate +10 + 3%\n\n**Set Effects:**\n* 3 pieces: Defense +300, Evasion +5%\n* 5 pieces: Defense +600, Evasion +12%\n\n*Clothing favored by the people of the East Continent.

The East Continent must be based on oriental culture, just like this continent mimics the west.*\n\nThe clothing resembled garments from the Joseon Dynasty.\n\nMore importantly...\n\n*It's like what Pagma wore.*\n\nThe connection was undeniable. Grid had heard countless references to the East Continent. Even the description of Piaro's Supreme Swordsmanship mentioned it.\n\nHe'd learned one critical fact: reaching the East Continent required crossing the Dead Sea. An impossible barrier.\n\n*So how did Kraugel get there?*\n\nThe question burned in his mind. He wanted to ask. But his pride held him back. Information that valuable shouldn't be given freely, and Grid refused to be the impertinent fool who begged for it.\n\nHe swallowed his curiosity. \"The set bonus requires five pieces. Take out the other two. I'll repair the whole set.\"\n\n\"This is all I have.\"\n\nGrid's head snapped up. \"...You fought me wearing only three pieces of armor?\"\n\nKraugel's expression remained neutral. In truth, he'd only worn two, leaving the gloves behind. But he saw no reason to elaborate. Excuses were the refuge of losers.\n\n\"I fought Brother Piaro the same way.\"\n\n\"...You're insane.\" The words came out with grudging admiration.\n\nGrid set to work. As a Legendary Blacksmith, producing quality cloth armor was well within his capabilities. Repairing proved straightforward. Kraugel watched his hands move with precise dexterity, then offered White Fang.\n\n\"Can you repair this as well?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nGrid took the blade. The moment his fingers closed around the hilt, excitement jolted through him.\n\n*This is incredible.*\n\n---\n\n**[+9 White Fang]**\n\n**Rating:** <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Legendary</span>\n\n**Durability:** 170/409 | **Attack Power:** 915+486\n\n* Attack speed +7 + 2%\n* Skill damage +10 + 5%\n* Ignores 20 + 10% of target's defense\n* After 3-hit combo: Inflicts additional cutting damage\n\n*The favored weapon of Drasion, one of the 33 Great Demons.*\n\n**Weight:** 887\n\n**Restriction:** Level 310+, Advanced Sword Mastery Lv. 5+\n\n---\n\n*He got this to +9? The money he must have spent...*\n\nEnhancing legendary equipment had abysmal success rates. Grid had passives that improved his odds, and even he'd burned through a fortune getting Failure to +9.\n\nKraugel's expenditure must have been astronomical.\n\n*Still, the performance is incredible.*\n\nWhite Fang was exceptional work. The options seemed sparse at first glance, but that was deliberate. Fewer options meant the base attack power could be pushed higher. For a one-handed sword, it rivaled Failure.\n\nThen doubt crept in.\n\n*Too weak for a Great Demon's weapon. The level requirement is low.*\n\nThe material itself was strange. It resembled mithril at first glance, but the hardness far exceeded it.\n\n*A metal even I can't identify...*\n\nLikely a material exclusive to Hell, like blood stone.\n\n*If I knew what this was made of, my blacksmithing skills would advance significantly...*\n\nGrid considered for a moment, then spoke. \"I might be able to draw out this sword's true power.\"\n\nKraugel's brow furrowed. \"...?\"\n\n\"If I upgrade its performance, could you help me with something in return?\"\n\nItems were critical in MMORPGs. Kraugel, ranked first, understood this better than anyone. He'd poured money into enhancement, worn incomplete armor sets because of class restrictions.\n\nNow a Legendary Blacksmith offered an upgrade. Irresistible.\n\n\"I accept. However, if your demand is unreasonable, I'll pay you what the upgrade is worth instead.\"\n\nGrid grinned. \"Deal.\"\n\nHe activated the skill.\n\n> [The Legendary Blacksmith's Appraisal skill has been used.]\n> \n> [The blacksmith who became a legend possesses an excellent discerning eye. Hidden features in the target item will be revealed.]\n> \n> [You have discovered a hidden feature in White Fang!]"
