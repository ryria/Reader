  "content": "# Chapter: The Saintess's Burden\n\nFifty good deeds per month. That was the threshold—the absolute minimum required to maintain the Saintess class. Fall below it, and the qualification would be stripped away permanently. No second chances. No redemption.\n\nRuby had spent years walking that line, transforming it into something far greater. Day after day, she'd helped those in need. The people of Reinhardt had given her names in return—*Angel with Lost Wings*, *Rebecca's Incarnation*, *The Merciful One*. Minstrels composed ballads about her deeds. Bards sang them in every tavern from the capital to the frontier.\n\nGrid might be the most famous player in Satisfy, but Ruby was the most beloved.\n\nOf course, Huroi's silver tongue had helped spread those tales. The Orator's gift for persuasion, combined with Overgeared members strategically positioned throughout the kingdom, had ensured Ruby's legend reached every corner of the realm.\n\n\"Saintess! Saintess Ruby!\" A baker rushed toward her, his flour-dusted apron flapping. \"Please, try this! The bread came out perfect today.\"\n\nBefore Ruby could respond, a merchant appeared at her elbow, breathless from running. \"Saintess, I saw this bracelet at the Winston market. The moment I laid eyes on it, I thought of you. Please, you must accept it.\"\n\nA grizzled hunter pushed through the small crowd forming around her. \"Made this coat myself. Wild boar leather, lined with soft fur. Winter's coming on hard this year. Can't have you catching cold—would break my heart.\"\n\n\"Saintess!\"\n\n\"Saintess Ruby!\"\n\nThe notifications cascaded across her vision:\n\n[You have received 10 quality rye bread from Jackson, Reinhardt's baker.]\n\n[You have received a low grade emerald bracelet from Ale, Reinhardt's merchant.]  \n\n[You have received a wild boar leather coat from Revalo, Reinhardt's hunter.]\n\n[Reinhardt's...]\n\nRuby's hands were full before she'd walked two blocks. She'd tried refusing at first—tried explaining that she didn't need payment for doing what was right. But the disappointment in their eyes had been crushing. Some had even wept, believing their gratitude insufficient. The gifts weren't bribes or transactions. They were *offerings*—tangible expressions of devotion she couldn't reject without causing genuine pain.\n\nThe daily value of these gifts now averaged around eighty gold. In Korean won, that translated to roughly ₩100,000 per day. Just for logging in. Just for being herself.\n\nA few months ago, she'd stopped accepting pocket money from her brother.\n\nHer classmates noticed. Friends whispered questions. *Why bother with university when you're already making money?* Some spoke with envy. Others, genuine confusion. *You could do what your brother does—be a professional player. Live the dream.*\n\nBut Ruby's resolve never wavered.\n\nSatisfy was lucrative now, yes. But games were fickle things. Trends shifted. Servers shut down. She'd spent her childhood and teenage years grinding toward university admission—the same brutal academic gauntlet every South Korean student endured. Those years of sacrifice deserved to reach their intended destination. She wanted to see for herself what a prestigious university could offer.\n\nThough if she was honest, her post-graduation plans had grown hazy. The Overgeared Kingdom needed her. *Desperately* needed her. And once she started university, she'd have even more time to dedicate to the game.\n\nThe thought didn't displease her. Far from it.\n\nRuby enjoyed helping people. More importantly, she wanted to support her brother's work. Even if she'd hated Satisfy, she would have forced herself to play—for him. How could she not?\n\nShe still remembered buying school supplies with anxiety gnawing at her stomach, counting every won. Remembered her parents' tired faces after long shifts. Remembered when street snacks were an impossible luxury.\n\nNow? Her family's refrigerator was always full. Her parents smiled every day. Her brother had transformed their lives.\n\n*This is all thanks to him.*\n\nWarmth spread through her chest. The constant worry she'd carried for Grid had finally lifted. Her brilliant, reckless, wonderful brother had made their family whole.\n\n*Mother and Father laugh now. We're happy. We're* safe.\n\nShe'd do anything for him.\n\nLauel knew this. Of course he did.\n\n---\n\n\"Ruby.\" The strategist's voice was calm, reasonable. \"I need you to encourage people to visit the Hall of Fame. Once every three days. Have them pray before Grid's statue.\"\n\nRuby frowned. \"You could just order the soldiers—\"\n\n\"Soldiers, yes. But ordinary citizens?\" Lauel shook his head. \"Force them, and we risk losing public sentiment. But you...\" He gestured toward her. \"They'll listen to *you*. They'll *want* to go if you ask.\"\n\n\"This is manipulation.\"\n\n\"This is leadership.\" Lauel's smile didn't reach his eyes. \"Please.\"\n\nRuby's jaw tightened. After Sticks had dismantled most of the Behen Archipelago's seals, travel to the islands had become possible for ordinary players. *Relatively* possible. The Hall of Fame sat on the archipelago's final island—a minimum five-hour journey from Reinhardt.\n\nFive hours. Every three days.\n\n\"The people...\" Ruby's voice was quiet. \"They'll have to waste so much time.\"\n\n\"I understand your concern.\" Lauel leaned forward. \"But consider this—won't regular five-hour walks improve their stamina? It's exercise. It's pilgrimage. It's community building.\"\n\n\"I don't trust you.\"\n\n\"Good. You shouldn't.\" Lauel's expression softened. \"I don't want to be the sinner who disappoints you.\"\n\nSilence stretched between them.\n\n*Perfect*, Lauel thought. He'd gauged his words carefully, calculated to resonate with Ruby's romantic nature. She'd agree. She always did when her brother's kingdom was at stake.\n\nRuby stared at him. Lauel had been single since birth, and it showed. His understanding of human emotion was purely tactical—moves on a board.\n\n\"I understand,\" she finally said. \"I'll do it.\"\n\n\"Excellent—\"\n\n\"But I'll make it right.\" Her red lips pressed into a determined line. Her hands clasped together tightly. \"I'll treat them better. Work harder on my good deeds. If they're sacrificing time for this, I'll give them more in return.\"\n\nShe was lovely when resolved. Lauel couldn't help smiling before catching himself with a small cough.\n\n\"Of course. Whatever you think best.\"\n\n*Instead, I'll try harder*, Ruby thought. *Just a bit more, Sehee. You can do this.*\n\n---\n\nThe quest notification appeared simultaneously for every player in the Overgeared Kingdom:\n\n> **[Visit Grid's Stone Statue]**\n> \n> **Difficulty:** Repeated quest in the Overgered Kingdom\n> \n> Once every three days, travel to the Hall of Fame and worship at Grid's stone statue.\n> \n> **Quest Reward:** One mass-produced Grid item for every 20 consecutive visits.\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe reaction was immediate.\n\n\"Are you *kidding* me?\" A warrior slammed his fist on a tavern table. \"I checked out that Hall of Fame buff last week. It's garbage for combat classes!\"\n\n\"Completely useless,\" his companion agreed. \"Maybe useful for, what, five percent of all classes?\"\n\n\"This is just Grid stroking his own ego.\"\n\n\"Making us worship his statue? It's vulgar.\"\n\n\"Greedy bastard.\"\n\n\"But...\" A mage at the next table sighed heavily. \"If we want Grid's set, we have to do it.\"\n\n\"That's the *point*. He's got us by the balls.\"\n\n\"Takes hours just to reach the Hall of Fame, too.\"\n\n\"Administrator Rabbit's selling movement scrolls to the Behen Archipelago now.\"\n\n\"Of course he is! Greedy king, greedy administrator. They're perfect for each other.\"\n\nGrumbling rippled through every tavern, every guild hall, every training ground in Reinhardt. The players were furious. But what choice did they have?\n\nThey'd joined the Overgeared Kingdom specifically to acquire Grid's equipment. One piece of the set every two months was slow—painfully slow—but refusing the quest meant abandoning that goal entirely.\n\n\"Once I complete the set, I'm leaving,\" muttered a swordsman, eyes dark with resentment. \"Straight to the Empire.\"\n\n\"I'm going to Valhalla,\" another declared. \"Ares treats his people better than this.\"\n\nThe sentiment was nearly universal. For most players, the Overgeared Kingdom was a stepping stone—a place to gear up before moving to greener pastures.\n\nLauel understood this perfectly. He'd accounted for it in his projections.\n\n\"We need to expand the mass-produced Grid set,\" he told Grid during their next meeting. \"Add more pieces.\"\n\nGrid looked up from the underwear he was stitching. \"The set has five pieces. Weapons, armor, helmet, gloves, boots. That's standard.\"\n\n\"Add a cloak. Add underwear.\" Lauel's eyes gleamed. \"Socks too, if you can manage it.\"\n\n\"The set effect is complete at five pieces. Adding more won't increase the bonus.\"\n\n\"So?\" Lauel's smile turned wicked. \"They don't need to know that. Keep the Grid name on everything. Offer the underwear and cloak as quest rewards *first*—make them think they're working toward a larger set. Slows down their collection rate. Keeps them here longer.\"\n\nGrid stared at him. \"Don't you have a conscience?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking of the *players*,\" Lauel said smoothly. \"You're the only person in this world who can produce underwear with stat bonuses. Where else will they get quality undergarments? They'll thank us.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nOne point of defense was still one point of defense. Grid found himself nodding. He tossed the pile of completed underwear at Lauel.\n\n\"I'll send more whenever I finish a batch.\"\n\n\"Excellent decision, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"...I should start on socks too.\"\n\nIf Grid had possessed a conscience, he might have thought, *I should make quality cloaks at least*. It wouldn't even be difficult—he was already planning to mass-produce Lantier's Cloak for the evil eyes. But conscience was a luxury Grid rarely indulged.\n\nHis mind raced through mental calculations, seeking the cheapest possible method for manufacturing socks.\n\n*No. Wait.*\n\nGrid paused mid-stitch.\n\n*If I want to keep players here longer, I need to make GOOD cloaks. Quality items. Give them something worth staying for.*\n\nIt was a rare moment of strategic thinking. Grid was many things—greedy, short-sighted, obsessive—but compared to Lauel's pure manipulation, he was practically benevolent.\n\nThis marginal advantage was somehow enough. The Overgeared Kingdom continued to function.\n\nThough one significant problem loomed on the horizon: What would the Empire do about Lubana's rebellion?\n\n---\n\n## Imperial Palace, Titan\n\n\"YOU MISSED THE DESCENDANT OF THE UNDEFEATED KING?\"\n\nEmperor Juander's roar shook the gilded halls. The Imperial Palace of Titan was considered one of the most magnificent structures on the continent—soaring ceilings, marble columns, priceless art adorning every surface. Beauty designed to inspire awe.\n\nRight now, it inspired terror.\n\n\"Useless!\" Juander's fist slammed onto the arm of his throne. \"Does it make sense? DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO LOSE AN ENTIRE REBEL ARMY?\"\n\nSword Duke Limit knelt before the throne, head bowed, jaw clenched. The emperor's eyes burned with contempt.\n\n\"The Red Knights have become *trivial*! This would never have happened under Piaro!\"\n\nLimit said nothing. What could he say?\n\nJuander was no fool. The emperor understood perfectly well that the current Red Knights operated under Empress Marie's influence. He'd watched as political maneuvering constrained them, weakened them, turned the continent's greatest military force into a chess piece in the imperial power struggle.\n\nBut that understanding didn't temper his fury.\n\n\"First Knight Mercedes and Second Knight Lucas will be held responsible!\" Juander's declaration cut through the throne room like a blade. \"Three months probation! Effective immediately!\"\n\n\"Your Majesty!\" Limit's head snapped up, shock breaking his composure. \"Mercedes and Lucas are the backbone of the Red Knights! Without them, operations will—\"\n\n\"Kyle will assume command during their absence.\"\n\nIce water flooded Limit's veins.\n\n*Kyle.*\n\nOne of the Empire's Five Pillars. The youngest of that elite group. His abilities weren't fully matured yet, but his *potential*—that potential had earned him the emperor's favor. Dangerous favor.\n\nLimit's mind raced. *Kyle has the appearance of virtue. But underneath? He's a snake. Propaganda. Manipulation. Political theater.*\n\nThe Red Knights were exhausted. Years of continuous warfare had ground them down. The only thing keeping them functional was their desperate hunger for recognition—the need to prove themselves worthy of their legendary name.\n\nAnd recently? Multiple knights had died in the former Eternal Kingdom. The Sixth Knight, Reidorn, had vanished without a trace. Rumors spread like poison. Their reputation had cratered. Anxiety dominated the ranks.\n\nMercedes and Lucas were their spiritual anchors. Remove them, and insert Kyle into that vacuum...\n\n*He'll either rule them or break them. This is Juander's real goal.*\n\nThe emperor was killing two birds with one stone. First: consolidate power that Empress Marie had distributed back under imperial control. Second: elevate Kyle's position among the Five Pillars, where he currently held the least influence.\n\nFor Sword Duke Limit—a member of the empress's faction—this was catastrophic.\n\nBut he couldn't object. The Red Knights had failed. They'd lost the descendant of the Undefeated King, potentially the greatest threat to the Empire in generations.\n\nLimit had no ground to stand on.\n\nSomeone else watched this exchange unfold. Not physically present in the throne room, but observing through the lens of a quest interface. Veradin—ranked first among necromancers, Agnus's closest confidant—leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled.\n\n*The quest parameters will shift based on Limit's response*, he mused.\n\nThe logic was clear. Kyle would almost certainly aim the Red Knights at Valhalla. Emperor Juander couldn't forgive Ares for sheltering the Undefeated King's heir. It was an insult that demanded blood.\n\nSo what would Limit do? Would he stand aside and watch Kyle destroy Valhalla, building his reputation on the corpses of Ares's forces?\n\nVeradin's lips curved into a thin smile.\n\n*Agnus and Ares might end up as allies. How deliciously ironic.*\n\nThe pieces were moving. The board was shifting. And somewhere in the spaces between kingdoms and quests, between loyalty and ambition, the true game was only beginning."
