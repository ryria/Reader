  "content": "**ROAR.**\n\nThe waterfall thundered like a bridge between heaven and earth. Rising from the heart of the sixty-second island—now cleansed of its corruption—the cascade stretched thousands of meters skyward, its true height impossible to judge. Water exploded outward in all directions, a perpetual rain that soaked the ground below.\n\nSticks stood apart from the spray, his frail body ill-suited to the cold mist. Grid, however, had long since grown into a man who faced steel blades without flinching. The deafening roar barely registered.\n\n\"Do you know what guardian awaits us next?\"\n\nInformation was power. Without his Immortality skill to lean on, Grid needed every advantage he could gather. If he could identify the next island's boss beforehand, he could prepare.\n\nUnfortunately, the next island lay beyond even Sticks' considerable knowledge—hardly surprising, considering he'd only reached the sixtieth island thanks to Grid's efforts.\n\n\"I cannot say with certainty... My apologies.\"\n\n\"Don't apologize.\"\n\nIn the past, Grid would have done far more than grumble. A being of great wisdom—an *elf*, no less—should have been able to help him. But Grid understood now. Lashing out when things didn't go his way only alienated potential allies. He imagined himself in Sticks' position. \n\nThe empathy prompted Sticks to try harder. After a moment's contemplation, the sage spoke.\n\n\"I can rule out Sword Saint Muller. Likewise, Pagma—the creator of this Behen Archipelago—is unlikely to appear. And certainly not Braham.\"\n\nThat last one was self-evident. Braham's soul currently resided with Grid. Still, the confirmation brought relief.\n\n'*If Braham appeared as a lich, I'd be finished.*'\n\nThe death knights of former legends could only wield basic skills—a critical weakness. But not Braham. Even his lowest-tier magic packed devastating power when enhanced by his genius. Lich Braham would be a nightmare opponent, even stripped of his advanced arsenal.\n\n'*You really are something else, aren't you?*'\n\n—*Hmph. Not all legends are created equal. I was the most outstanding among them.*\n\nA little praise, and Braham's ego inflated like a hot air balloon. Rich, coming from someone who trolled Grid at every opportunity. Grid mentally rolled his eyes as Sticks continued his analysis.\n\n\"Excluding those three, plus Lantier and Alex, four legends remain: the legendary archer Povia, the legendary tailor Kruger, the legendary miner Gis, and...\"\n\nNine legends total. That left one unaccounted for. Grid already knew.\n\n\"Madra?\"\n\n\"You've deduced correctly.\"\n\nThe Undefeated King Madra, who had overwhelmed the Saharan Empire itself. The only monarch among the first legends.\n\n\"Those four will appear sequentially on the remaining islands.\"\n\nNo way to predict the order. Yet Grid's tension eased.\n\n\"Two of them should be straightforward.\"\n\nThe legendary miner and legendary tailor. Production classes—how threatening could they be?\n\n\"...You're a blacksmith.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Pagma* was a blacksmith. And a master swordsman. No reason to assume Gis and Kruger wouldn't possess similar versatility.\n\n\"Right. Reasonable assumption...\"\n\nGrid's pulse quickened. If his own progression was any indication, Gis and Kruger would be far from easy prey. Worse, he had no intelligence on their combat capabilities. Thankfully, Sage Sticks filled in the gaps.\n\n\"Madra was a strategist who mastered martial arts. Gis is a tank who demonstrated rock-solid defenses through raw physical prowess. Kruger earned fame through his killer needles.\"\n\n\"Hm...\"\n\nGrid sorted his opponents mentally. Povia and Gis seemed manageable.\n\n'*Archers aren't a major threat. Close the gap to two hundred meters, use Freely Move to rush in, then overwhelm them at close range where their physical stats are weakest.*'\n\nTanks posed similar problems.\n\n'*Low offensive capability. Meanwhile, I excel in both defense and attack. As long as I keep hitting Gis, attrition works in my favor.*'\n\nMadra, though—that was different.\n\n'*If he truly mastered all martial arts, he'll have access to countless sword techniques. Most of his prime abilities are sealed, but sheer variety makes him dangerous. Plus he's royalty. That First King title probably grants survival passives.*'\n\nMadra warranted caution. But Kruger? That remained unclear. \"Killer needles\" told him nothing. Time to consult the expert again.\n\n\"What exactly are killer needles?\"\n\nSticks obliged.\n\n\"Battle-specialized acupuncture designed to drive opponents to death. As a legendary tailor, Kruger mastered sewing—which translates to preternatural needle control. His precision striking technique can overwhelm enemies through targeted vulnerabilities.\"\n\n\"Hm...\"\n\nThe description evoked martial arts, where acupuncture could supposedly kill or cure with a single needle. Still, Grid remained unconvinced.\n\n'*Sounds underwhelming.*'\n\nNeedles had obvious limitations. Too short to compete with sword range. He could swat them aside easily. Moreover—\n\n'*Thin means weak penetration.*'\n\nHis Triple Layers armor could deflect knife strikes. A skinny needle wouldn't pierce that defense. Grid allowed himself a confident smile.\n\n\"Everyone except Madra should be manageable.\"\n\nIdeally, he'd face Madra last—after clearing the easier opponents, claiming their items, and growing stronger through accumulated advantages.\n\n[The cooldown time of Immortality is over.]\n\nPerfect timing. Grid stepped onto the bridge leading to the next island and waved at Sticks.\n\n\"See you on the other side.\"\n\n\"Good fortune.\"\n\nSticks watched Grid's confident stride with a vague sense of unease. But he kept it to himself. He trusted Grid's capabilities. Meanwhile, Grid crossed the bridge and entered the gate.\n\n**Flash!**\n\nGrid vanished. The sixty-third island awaited.\n\n***\n\n[You have entered the 63rd island.]\n\n'*Who's first?*'\n\nPovia, Madra, Gis, or Kruger—which of the remaining four legends guarded this island? Grid immediately checked for sniping positions. The God Hands spread out, scanning likely vantage points. An archer required preemptive countermeasures.\n\nBut no arrows flew. Seconds stretched into a minute. The probability of facing Povia plummeted.\n\n'*Unlike Lantier and Alex, there's no immediate ambush...*'\n\nWhich suggested Gis or Kruger. Both were presumably weaker combatants who wouldn't engage recklessly.\n\n\"Legendary Tailor's Eye.\"\n\n\"...?!\"\n\nIce flooded Grid's veins. That distinctive death knight rasp echoed from a boulder behind him—hollow and resonant, like a voice spoken in a vast cavern.\n\n\"God Hands!\"\n\nGrid snapped the constructs into defensive positions, drawing the Enlightenment Blade to counterattack. But the death knight simply stared.\n\nIts name was Kruger. The legendary tailor who had crafted the Invisibility Cloak. And it spoke again.\n\n\"Legendary Tailor's Eye.\"\n\n\"...!\"\n\nUnderstanding crystallized. If that ability mirrored his own Legendary Blacksmith's Eye, Kruger was analyzing Grid's equipment—searching for weaknesses. He couldn't allow a free appraisal.\n\nBesides, he'd written Kruger off as an easy opponent.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship, Transcended Link!\"\n\n**BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!**\n\nA storm of blade strikes hammered the boulder directly! Grid assumed Kruger couldn't defend while maintaining his inspection skill. While the tailor reeled from the damage, he'd close the gap and chain into a follow-up—\n\n**Schwing!**\n\nA needle sliced toward Grid's forehead even as he leaped toward the rock. It emerged from the explosion itself, riding the shockwave. And there was no damage notification.\n\n'*He dodged or blocked Transcended Link?*'\n\nImpossible to comprehend, but Grid maintained composure. He twisted away from the five-centimeter needle and landed atop the boulder.\n\nThen froze.\n\n'*What?*'\n\nGone. Kruger had vanished. Grid stood alone on the rock.\n\n'*How—?*'\n\n—*Use Magic Detection.*\n\nBraham's voice cut through his confusion—the same advice given during Lantier's ambush. Understanding clicked.\n\n'*The Invisibility Cloak!*'\n\nOf course. The legendary tailor Kruger. Just as legendary blacksmith Grid was overgeared, Kruger would naturally equip his own masterworks.\n\n**Thwip!**\n\nPain lanced through Grid's side before he could cast Magic Detection. A needle from the hidden Kruger had found its mark. But—\n\n[You have suffered 430 damage.]\n\nA needle was still just a needle. It couldn't pierce Triple Layers. The impact barely registered, the damage negligible.\n\n\"Are you serious?\"\n\nGrid snorted and began the sword dance for Wave. An area-of-effect skill would flush out the invisible opponent, then he'd follow up with Magic Detection. But—\n\n[Kruger's acupuncture needle has reversed your mana flow.]\n\n[You cannot resist.]\n\n[Pagma's Swordsmanship, Wave has failed.]\n\n[Your health will suffer three times the mana consumed by the failure.]\n\n[You have suffered 2,400 damage.]\n\n\"...?!\"\n\nThe strongest debuffer. That was Kruger's true threat. Goosebumps rippled across Grid's skin as he scrambled backward. Meanwhile, Kruger dropped his invisibility and revealed himself—a death knight clutching three needles between each finger joint. Ten fingers. Thirty needles total. The robe made him resemble a lich.\n\n\"Legendary Tailor's Eye.\"\n\n**Snap!**\n\nKruger activated the skill again. Violet light enveloped Grid as the tailor dissected detailed information about every equipped item.\n\n\"You bastard!\"\n\nGrid lunged. The mana reflux effect was single-use, so skills would work now. He triggered Link without hesitation.\n\n**Flash!**\n\nA translucent barrier materialized—ten meters in radius, encircling Kruger. Grid's Link slammed into it head-on.\n\n**CLANG!**\n\n**CLANG-CLANG-CLANG-CLANG!**\n\n\"....?!\"\n\nNothing. The barrier didn't budge. It absorbed Grid's full assault without so much as a ripple, even as black flames detonated against its surface. Grid's mind raced.\n\n'*What kind of absurd defensive technique—?*'\n\nWait. This wasn't Kruger's skill. This was *system protection*. The notification confirmed it.\n\n[For the next 10 minutes, the legendary tailor Kruger will craft an item!]\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nInside the barrier, the death knight squatted down. Produced cloth from thin air. And began sewing with his needles.\n\nIt looked utterly ridiculous.\n\n\"??????\"\n\nQuestion marks materialized above Grid's head."
