He'd drawn every weapon in his arsenal, and through the bitter taste of defeat, he'd learned something critical: advanced swordsmanship demanded a one-handed sword, not a greatsword.\n\n*The greatsword is too heavy. Too slow. Its path is predictable—limited by its own weight.*\n\nGrid's combat philosophy had always been simple: hit hard, hit often, overwhelm through sheer destructive force. For Pagma's Descendant—a class built around raw damage output—the greatsword had been perfect.\n\nUntil it wasn't.\n\nElfin Stone. Braham. Piaro. Against opponents of that caliber, his old tactics crumbled. Destructive power meant nothing if he couldn't land a clean hit. Against truly superior opponents, brute force was just noise.\n\n*I need to master the one-handed sword.*\n\nHe possessed <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Iyarugt</span>, a blade whose attack power rivaled any greatsword. After his confrontation with Piaro, Grid threw himself into training with single-minded focus.\n\nThe old Grid—the Grid from a year ago—would have dismissed this. *Too much effort. Just get better gear.*\n\nBut that man was dead. Now, Grid trained with the same obsessive dedication he brought to his forge. He'd tasted power, glimpsed the summit, and the hunger to climb higher consumed him.\n\n***\n\n*My control has improved. My technique is sharper than it's ever been.*\n\nArrogance. That's what it had been. Today, against Chucksley—a knight whose name he'd never even heard before—Grid's carefully honed skills had been exposed as inadequate. <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Iyarugt</span> had whispered the optimal sword paths into his mind, showing him the perfect angles of attack, and still he'd barely survived. The frustration gnawed at him.\n\nWithout the God Hands, he would have lost. That truth sat like lead in his stomach.\n\nBut deploying the God Hands offensively was too risky. He stood in the heart of enemy territory. An attack could come from any direction at any moment. The God Hands had to stay on defense, circling him like golden sentinels.\n\nThen the tide shifted. His allies crashed into the enemy formation like a wave. Confusion rippled through the royal troops. The pressure on Grid eased. The enemy's attention fractured.\n\nGrid seized the opening. He unleashed the Magic Missiles he'd been hoarding—his hidden trump card—and finally broke Chucksley's rhythm. Then he'd pivoted, chasing down Chucksley's companion.\n\nThe bait.\n\n***\n\n\"Kuk...!\"\n\nChucksley staggered as **Kill** tore through his defenses, his health plummeting to two-thirds. Grid had taken a vicious blow to intercept that strike, grabbing Chucksley's neck even as the knight's blade carved into his chest. Blood poured from the wound, hot and sticky.\n\nHis health bar didn't budge.\n\nThe <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Holy Light Armor</span> absorbed the damage. <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Doran's Ring</span> regenerated the lost health instantly. Grid had read Chucksley's Rising Sword technique the moment before it landed—a split-second judgment enabled by the <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Slaughterer's Eye Patch</span>—and equipped the ring at the perfect moment.\n\nAny ranker watching would have been impressed by the seamless execution.\n\nGrid's smile was cold steel. He leaned close, voice dropping to a whisper.\n\n\"Have you heard of being overgeared?\"\n\nChucksley's brow furrowed. \"Overgeared?\"\n\nThe word made no sense. This commoner used such obscure terminology—such convoluted jargon.\n\n*I assumed he was uneducated, being baseborn, but he speaks like a scholar...!*\n\nThe frustration of not understanding made Chucksley's jaw tighten. Then four golden hands materialized around him, weapons gleaming in their grasp.\n\n*This—!*\n\nThe hands moved independently, each one wielding its weapon with lethal precision. Three of them? No—four. Chucksley felt danger prickle down his spine. He wrenched himself free of Grid's grasp, the physical contest lost. Grid stumbled back but didn't hesitate.\n\n\"Magic Missile!\"\n\n*Jiing.*\n\nMagic power coalesced at the fingertips of the four God Hands.\n\n*Pepepepeng!*\n\nWhite flashes erupted outward. The missiles hammered into Chucksley.\n\n\"Kuaaaaak!\"\n\nPain. Real, undeniable pain. For such a basic spell, the damage was absurd—far beyond what Magic Missile should be capable of. Chucksley's mind reeled, searching for an explanation.\n\n*Why is my White Armor's resistance being bypassed?!*\n\nThe Lokan family had served the Eternal royal line for generations. Chucksley had earned glory on countless battlefields, bled for the crown, and been rewarded accordingly. The White Armor was one such reward—a treasure of his house.\n\nIt boasted exceptional physical defense and high magic resistance. In every war, wearing this armor had made him unstoppable. He crushed enemy warriors with his blade and shrugged off surprise magical attacks with ease.\n\nAnd yet—\n\n\"Cough! Cough!\"\n\nA low-level spell had punched through his armor like it was cloth. Blood filled his mouth. But that wasn't even the most confusing part.\n\nPagma's Descendant was a blacksmith. How could he even cast magic? The answer had to lie with those golden hands.\n\n*What are they? What is their true nature?*\n\nChucksley coughed blood, his thoughts fragmenting. Nothing about Grid made sense. It was like facing an existence from another plane entirely. This feeling—he'd felt it once before, during the golem invasion of Reinhardt.\n\n*Why?*\n\nHe had trained until he bled. Trained until his sword became an extension of his soul. He'd earned the title of Great Swordsman through endless suffering. Even with Piaro gone—the man once called the continent's greatest—why did this gap still exist?\n\n*This is a legend!*\n\nBut Grid's growth should have plateaued. Legends stopped advancing once they reached their peak. That was the natural order.\n\nChucksley's voice cracked. \"Why? Why have you become stronger?\"\n\nGrid's gaze had changed. The arrogance from their first meeting was gone. Now, his eyes held something else—something like respect. He regarded Chucksley not as an insect to be crushed, but as a warrior worthy of honesty.\n\n\"I am still weak.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nGrid had crushed the golem army threatening the kingdom. Grid had just defeated Chucksley himself. What could those words possibly mean? Chucksley's confusion deepened as Grid continued, almost quoting something he'd heard before.\n\n\"The world is wide. There are many strong people in it. If you ever meet a true powerhouse, you'll understand.\" Grid's expression was distant, haunted. \"You'll see how incomplete I am.\"\n\nBraham. Piaro. Against them, the word \"legend\" felt like a cruel joke. Grid knew he hadn't reached his full potential—not even close. Failing to complete his class quests was part of it, but he understood the deeper truth now.\n\n*It's not the quests holding me back.*\n\nIt was his own inadequacy. If Yura or Huroi had been given these quests, they wouldn't have been stuck for months on a single objective. They were simply better.\n\n*I have no talent.*\n\nNot Regas's or Faker's control. Not Jishuka's or Pon's leveling speed. Grid possessed no innate gifts, no natural weapons to rely on. The only reason he'd reached this point was tenacity—pure, bloody-minded refusal to give up. Without that stubbornness, he never would have found Pagma's Rare Book. He'd still be wallowing at level 30, crushed by debt.\n\nGrid exhaled. \"I'll keep pushing forward. Keep getting stronger.\" His eyes hardened. \"As long as I survive this.\"\n\nKilling intent radiated from him like heat from a forge. Respect was one thing. Mercy was another. These invaders had dared attack Reidan—his city, his people. Twenty thousand souls who looked to him for protection, who showed him unwavering loyalty.\n\nThe soldiers before him sought to harm those people.\n\nForgiveness was impossible. He wouldn't simply defeat them. He would erase them.\n\n—Grid, everything is ready.\n\nThe battlefield had shifted into the ideal formation. Reidan's archers loosed volley after volley, whittling down the royal troops. Laden and the northern army locked them in place, denying retreat. Then Lauel activated the pinnacle skill of a third advancement qigong master: **Master of the Flow**.\n\nNow only one task remained.\n\n—Imprint on the world that your territory is off limits.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nLauel would handle the rest. Grid turned his attention to Ferrell. The archer was gasping, too wounded to resist as Grid's blade found his heart.\n\n> [You have defeated Viscount Ferrell, the best archer of the Eternal Kingdom.]\n> \n> [The Bon family will be forever hostile towards you.]\n> \n> [356,410,000 experience has been acquired.]\n> \n> [The Thunder Bow has been acquired.]\n> \n> [Your demonic power has increased by 2.]\n\n\"Ferrell!\"\n\nChucksley's anguished cry echoed across the field. The two knights had been brothers in all but blood, forged together through countless battles. Chucksley's eyes blazed with hatred as they locked onto Grid.\n\nGrid met that gaze with cold indifference.\n\n\"Remember who started this.\" His voice cut like wire. \"You raised your swords first. Despite the fact that I saved your kingdom, you're all less than dogs.\"\n\nGrid stood tall, radiating wicked arrogance. To truly instill fear—to plant seeds of regret in the enemy's heart—overwhelming power alone wasn't enough. Attitude mattered. Presence mattered.\n\nHuroi had drilled this into him.\n\n\"You bastard!\"\n\n\"Viscount Ferrell!\"\n\nFerrel Shaiva du Bon—lord of the Shaiva estate, bearer of a proud name, respected across the kingdom. His death would ignite the fury of not just his estate, but the royal family itself. Three hundred knights and soldiers surged toward Grid, a tide of steel and rage.\n\n\"Protect the duke!\"\n\nLaden's desperate shout rang out. The northern army moved to intercept. Grid raised his hand, stopping them.\n\n\"Ohhhhhh!\"\n\n\"Die!\"\n\nGrid stood alone as three hundred enemies bore down on him. From his hidden position among the escort knights, Prince Ren watched with predatory anticipation.\n\n*Suffer. I'll make you regret everything.*\n\nGrid began his sword dance.\n\nIt was a mesmerizing sight—deadly artistry unfolding amid a field soaked in blood and viscera. Or perhaps it was the performance of a madman too far gone to recognize his own doom.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship, **Wave!**\"\n\n*Kurururu!*\n\n<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Iyarugt</span> offered superior attack speed compared to a greatsword—an advantage that compounded over the course of a long battle. But for single, devastating strikes, it couldn't match the raw power of his greatsword.\n\nGrid swapped weapons mid-motion. <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Grid's Greatsword</span> filled his grip—a weapon of unmatched attack power, with an option that amplified skill damage. The black waves of force erupted outward, a tsunami of cutting energy.\n\nThe three hundred Shaiva troops couldn't withstand it.\n\n*Monster!*\n\nGrid's eyes glowed crimson in the carnage. Prince Ren felt ice crawl up his spine, but he forced himself to endure.\n\n\"Don't overdo it! Time is on our side!\"\n\nJust a little longer. If they held out, the two thousand soldiers crossing the Altes Mountains would crash into Reidan from behind. Victory was a matter of endurance.\n\nAnd more than that—\n\n*Grid! Your wife will soon be in my hands!*\n\nThey only needed to survive until then. Prince Ren smiled behind his visor, confident in his web of strategies."
