The man stood there in ragged farmer's clothing, not a scratch on him despite the barrage Grid had unleashed.\n\n*At least level 400.*\n\nHe didn't need the Great Lord's Sword to confirm it. The numbers spoke for themselves. Every strike he'd landed had done nothing. Zero damage. Against an unarmored target.\n\n*A hundred level gap. Maybe more.*\n\nThe disparity crushed down on him like a physical weight. A hundred levels wasn't just a number. It was a chasm. Stats doubled, tripled. Skills evolved into something unrecognizable. The system's level compensation only went so far. By every logical calculation, his odds of winning were nonexistent.\n\nBut logic had limits.\n\n*I don't need logic. I have items.*\n\nThe thought steadied him. Items were the great equalizer. The system's balance was a joke when you had the right gear. For players scraping by with marketplace trash, that imbalance was torture. For Grid, it was salvation.\n\nPiaro wore farming tools. <span class=\"rarity-rare\">Rare</span> rated at best. Old cloth that wouldn't stop a kitchen knife.\n\n*The matchup favors me.*\n\nGrid had faced down a legendary farmer before. Witnessed the absurd strength firsthand. But a farmer was still a farmer. How could that compare to a Sword Saint? The class that stood at the pinnacle of all swordsmen?\n\n*I'll drag you back to the sword, old man.*\n\nHe activated Item Disassembly. The four golden blades hovering near him shimmered and dissolved. The Water Clan King's Tears separated out, each one a perfect teardrop of crystallized magic. He pocketed those. The rest, twenty-seven pieces of pure pavranium, went straight into the furnace.\n\nHeat washed over his face. The metal began to glow.\n\nKhan appeared at his elbow, squinting into the furnace. The young blacksmiths crowded behind him, jostling for position.\n\n*What's he making this time?*\n\nThey watched Grid's hands move. Measured. Precise. He pulled a section of clay toward him and began shaping a mold.\n\nThe young blacksmiths frowned. Khan tilted his head.\n\n*That's not a blade.*\n\nIt wasn't a spear either. Not an arrowhead or an axe. The shape was too organic. Too familiar.\n\nGrid pressed his palm into the clay, adjusting the curves with a sculptor's focus. Five times. Five perfect impressions.\n\n*His hands?*\n\nTtang! Ttang!\n\nGrid's hammer rang against the mold frames, sealing them shut. The molten pavranium in the furnace had taken on a liquid gold sheen. He lifted the crucible with both hands and poured.\n\nGold flowed into each cavity. Steam hissed where it touched moisture. The smell of hot metal filled the smithy.\n\n***\n\nJishuka wiped blood off her bowstring and glanced at the entrance to the tenth vampire city. Same dark halls. Same Gothic architecture. Same endless waves of bloodsuckers.\n\n\"We're running the same five cities over and over.\" She notched another arrow. \"When's Grid coming back?\"\n\nPon drove his spear through a vampire's chest and kicked the corpse away. \"Two days. Maybe three.\"\n\n\"He's got something important going on.\" Regas crushed a vampire's skull with his bare fist. \"Said it's urgent.\"\n\n\"More important than the experience buff?\" Yura's magic bullets tore through three targets in rapid succession. \"We only have twenty-five days left.\"\n\n\"He made Chris a greatsword last week.\" Vantner's shield caught a blood spear mid-flight. \"What else could he be crafting?\"\n\n\"Maybe Chris screwed him over?\"\n\n\"No.\" Lauel's voice was calm as he redirected a blood wave with his qigong. \"He said he's making the ultimate overgeared item.\"\n\nEveryone paused mid-swing.\n\n\"The ultimate what?\"\n\nSwords made sense. Spears. Bows. Those were weapons. Fighting tools. But the 'ultimate overgeared item' was too vague.\n\n\"Did he figure out instant Item Combination?\" Zednos's wind magic scattered a group of approaching vampires.\n\n\"That's…\" Lauel hesitated. \"Not impossible. Pagma's Descendant has too many hidden abilities. And Grid exploits every one of them.\"\n\nThe Overgeared members exchanged glances. None of them could predict what Grid was building.\n\n***\n\nThe molds cooled. Grid cracked them open one by one. Golden hands emerged, still warm to the touch. He set them on the workbench in a neat row.\n\nFive perfect replicas of his own hands. Down to the fingerprints.\n\nHe stepped back and activated the pavranium.\n\nThe hands floated. Hovering at chest height. Fingers spread wide like blooming flowers.\n\n*Yes!*\n\nGrid's mind raced through applications. Five shields orbiting him in combat. Five swords striking in perfect coordination. Enemies wouldn't know where to block. He'd be untouchable.\n\nKhan gasped. The young blacksmiths stumbled backward, staring at the floating hands like they'd witnessed a miracle.\n\nGrid pulled his weapons from inventory. <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Failure</span>. <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Iyarugt</span>. Grid's Greatsword. The Ideal Dagger. The <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Divine Shield</span>.\n\nHe laid them on the workbench and pointed.\n\n\"Equip these!\"\n\nThe five hands shot forward.\n\nAnd slammed into the weapons like drunken birds hitting windows.\n\nMetal clattered against stone. The Ideal Dagger skittered across the floor. Grid's Greatsword landed flat with a dull clang.\n\nGrid stared.\n\n*What…*\n\nThe hands hovered back into formation. Palms open. Fingers rigid. Utterly useless.\n\n\"Grab them!\" Grid's voice cracked. \"You fold your fingers! Like this!\"\n\nHe demonstrated. Closed fist. Open palm. Closed fist. Open palm.\n\nThe pavranium didn't move.\n\n\"Are you serious right now?!\"\n\nSilence.\n\nGrid made the motions again. Slower. More exaggerated. \"Rock! Paper! Scissors! Do it!\"\n\nThe hands floated there. Mocking him with their stillness.\n\n\"Why won't you move?!\"\n\nThe young blacksmiths shifted uncomfortably. One of them whispered to another. \"Is Lord Grid… okay?\"\n\n\"Should we get help?\"\n\nKhan shook his head and sighed. \"It's been a while since I've seen this side of him.\"\n\n***\n\nGrid forced himself to stop yelling. He pulled up the item information.\n\n> **[Hand Model of a Legendary Blacksmith]**\n> \n> **Attack Power:** 22  \n> **Weight:** 15\n> \n> A model of the hands of the legendary blacksmith Grid.\n> \n> It is made of pavranium, so it can move by itself.\n> \n> If the open palms hit the opponent's cheeks, the provocation effect is activated.\n\nHe read it twice. Then a third time.\n\n*Oh.*\n\nThe realization hit like cold water. Hands were complex. Joints within joints. Twenty-seven bones per hand. Tendons. Ligaments. Muscles. All of it working together to produce the fine motor control that let him grip a sword or thread a needle.\n\nThese pavranium hands had none of that. They were solid blocks shaped like hands. No internal structure. No articulation.\n\nExpensive, useless paperweights.\n\n\"Shit.\"\n\nHe needed to understand human anatomy. The full biomechanics of a hand. Every joint. Every pivot point. Otherwise, he was just making sculptures.\n\nGrid pulled up his interface and searched for reference materials.\n\n\"An encyclopedia won't help.\" He rubbed his face. \"I need actual medical texts.\"\n\nMedical texts required comprehension. Reading ability. An IQ above room temperature.\n\nGrid's hands trembled.\n\n*Why does a game require me to understand anatomy?!*\n\nThe old Grid would have raged. Would have screamed about how games were supposed to be fun, not homework. Would have demanded the developers make things simpler for stupid people.\n\nBut he wasn't that person anymore.\n\nIf he wanted the God Hands, he'd earn them. No shortcuts.\n\nGrid took a breath and logged out.\n\n***\n\nShin Youngwoo sat at his desk with three browser windows open. Medical encyclopedia. Anatomy diagrams. A tutorial video on hand biomechanics.\n\n*The thumb has two joints. The fingers have three. Tendons on the front and back. Nerves and blood vessels on the sides.*\n\nHe scribbled notes on scrap paper. Drew crude diagrams. Rewatched the video when he forgot something.\n\nHis memory was garbage. Always had been. Information slipped through his brain like water through a sieve. So he repeated everything five times. Ten times. Until it stuck.\n\n*I can't forget this after logging back in.*\n\nTechnically, the Creation skill would handle most of the work. The system's correction function was powerful. He just needed the basic framework. A rough blueprint.\n\nBut Youngwoo kept studying. Kept memorizing. He wanted perfect hands. Not functional hands. Not passable hands. Perfect.\n\n\"Youngwoo! Trash day!\"\n\nHis mother's voice cut through his focus like a cleaver through meat.\n\n\"I'm studying!\" Youngwoo shouted back. \"For the first time in five years!\"\n\nShe always did this. Always picked the exact moment he was focused to interrupt. Homework? Interrupted. Studying for an exam? Interrupted. Trying to learn hand anatomy at three in the morning? Interrupted.\n\n*Does she have psychic powers or something?*\n\nYoungwoo grumbled but stood up. He grabbed the trash bag and headed for the door. Sunglasses went on. Face mask secured.\n\n*Millions of anti-fans because of Braham.*\n\nHe hadn't checked social media in days. Didn't dare. The incident had probably exploded into a full-blown scandal by now. People loved to hate. Loved to tear down anyone who stood out.\n\nBetter to stay hidden. Better to keep moving.\n\nHe carried the trash to the curb and hurried back inside before anyone could recognize him."
