The divine power within the White Light Mithril suppresses the demonic energy of Astaroth's Horn while amplifying the lightning properties of the Strengthened Blue Dragon's Breath. The exquisite blade, crafted from an ancient creature's shell, could threaten even the divine. By pushing pavranium to its absolute limits, the hidden attribute 'God Hand' has been manifested.*\n\n*The God Hand perfectly replicates the form pavranium maintained over countless years—the hand of blacksmith Grid, who bestowed enlightenment upon a god.*\n\n* The blade orbits its master autonomously, capable of independent judgment and action\n\n**Conditions of Use:** Pagma, Grid  \n**Weight:** 2,580\n\n---\n\n[God Hand]\n\nSummons a golden hand modeled after Grid's own. The construct orbits the wielder of Blade Aiming at the Gods, providing protection. Low probability of firing **Magic Missile (Enhanced)** at enemies without resource consumption.\n\n**Maximum Summons:** 8 God Hands simultaneously  \n**Summon Duration:** Indefinite  \n**Cooldown:** 5 minutes\n\n---\n\n[Contempt For the Weak]\n\nDelivers a fatal blow to targets outside the transcendent realm. Strikes for 80% of target's current health.\n\n**Mana Cost:** 5,000  \n**Cooldown:** 1 hour\n\n---\n\nA divine blade embodying Grid's complete mastery and the finest materials. The incorporation of pavranium had limited his use of other premium minerals, but the result spoke for itself—base statistics surpassing all previous weapons, combined with autonomous mobility. Unlimited potential.\n\nGrid clenched his fist. *This has to be the strongest weapon I've ever created.*\n\nHis certainty lasted exactly until Hexetia's final product manifested.\n\n---\n\n[Hexetia's Small Sword]\n\n**Rating:** Myth  \n**Durability:** Infinite  \n**Attack Power:** 28,990\n\n* Attack speed increased by 80%\n* Physical and magic damage increased by 200%\n* All attribute damage +200%\n\n*A compact blade forged by God Hexetia, a blacksmith inspired to surpass his previous limits.*\n\n**Conditions of Use:** Transcendent  \n**Weight:** 1,100\n\n---\n\nGrid's breath caught in his throat.\n\n*An extra zero...?*\n\nHe blinked. Rubbed his eyes. Read the numbers again, digit by digit.\n\n28,990.\n\nNot a mistake.\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe triumph drained from his body. The chasm between mortal and divine yawned before him—vast, insurmountable, absolute.\n\n*This is rigged.* His jaw tightened. *How am I supposed to win against something that breaks every rule?*\n\nQuest failure. The bitter taste of defeat settled on his tongue.\n\nThen—\n\n---\n\n> [Quest Complete!]\n>\n> [You have defeated a god in a blacksmithing competition!]\n\n---\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nHis defeat had been absolute. How—?\n\n*Is this thing broken?*\n\nA bug. Had to be. Which meant penalties incoming—account suspension, progress reset, the whole catastrophe. Grid's hand rose instinctively, mouth opening to shout that the match was invalid—\n\n---\n\n> [Hexetia acknowledges you. Abandoning jealousy, he has gained enlightenment from your work. He no longer doubts your intentions in establishing his temple.]\n\n---\n\nThe notification windows cascaded past his vision just as Hexetia's voice resonated across the cloud field.\n\n\"The blacksmith Grid has bestowed upon me new enlightenment. He is my benefactor. Through him, I will bless all humanity.\"\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nUnderstanding crashed over Grid like a wave.\n\n*That's* why he'd won. Not through superior craftsmanship, but through something more fundamental—he'd freed Hexetia from the chains of inadequacy.\n\nPride surged through Grid's chest, warm and bright. He'd walked that same dark path himself, knew intimately the weight of self-doubt. And now? Now he'd helped another escape it.\n\n*Hexetia won't be alone anymore.* The happiness awaiting the god would be vast enough to heal wounds Grid could only imagine.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nHexetia approached across the clouds, his expression caught between awkwardness and profound relief.\n\n\"By observing you, I discovered my purpose.\" The god's voice carried the wonder of revelation. \"I feel the value of my own achievements now. The envy—it's gone. I won't need others' approval to feel whole. Even in solitude, I won't be lonely.\" His smile steadied. \"This is your doing.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nEmotion threatened to choke Grid's response. Something had shifted in him—from victim of wounds to healer of them. The transformation felt monumental.\n\n*I did this. I helped him.*\n\nThanks to Hexetia, Grid discovered a deeper vein of self-worth than he'd known existed.\n\n\"...Thank you.\" The words came quiet but certain. \"Really.\"\n\nGrid had spent years speaking to others without honorifics—not from disrespect, but from a desperate need to preserve his own status as a nation's leader. Elevating himself by linguistic distance. The behavior of incomplete self-esteem.\n\nNow, standing on these divine clouds, he finally understood his own worth. The need to perform superiority evaporated.\n\nHe wouldn't waste energy on such performances again.\n\n---\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\n---\n\nThe world message blazed across every player's vision:\n\n> [The blacksmith Grid has bestowed upon me new enlightenment. He is my benefactor. Through him, I will bless all humanity.]\n\n---\n\n\"EXCLUSIVE!\" Reporters scattered across the Overgeared Kingdom, who'd been camping for any sign of the missing Grid, simultaneously logged out.\n\nWithin minutes, headlines erupted worldwide:\n\n**[Grid: First Player to Reach Asgard?]**\n\n**[Grid Acknowledged by Deity!]**\n\nThe wild speculation—great demon curses, Rebecca's wrath, account suspension for bug exploitation—dissolved like morning mist. In its place: recognition of Grid's achievement.\n\nFor blacksmith players especially, everything changed.\n\n\"My skill proficiency just increased!\" one player shouted in a smithy. \"Grid did this!\"\n\n\"I heard the Overgeared Kingdom's hiring smiths now. Might be time to relocate...\"\n\nPreviously, many blacksmiths had resented Grid. His legendary status felt like a rebuke to their efforts, as if their years of work meant nothing. The Overgeared Kingdom's recruitment announcements had gone largely ignored.\n\nNo longer.\n\nHow could anyone deny a blacksmith acknowledged by a god himself?\n\nThe exodus began.\n\nBlacksmiths streamed toward the Overgeared Kingdom in numbers that devastated other nations' weapons production. Military armories ran dry. Distribution chains collapsed.\n\nValhalla suffered worst of all.\n\nFresh from conquering the Ultina Kingdom, Ares desperately needed weapons for rapid militarization. The Saharan Empire's attention had turned back to them—armament was survival.\n\nBut weapons required blacksmiths.\n\nAres could summon soldiers with his skills. He could not conjure weapons from nothing.\n\n\"We need to request smith support from Grid immediately!\" His aides pressed around the war table, voices urgent.\n\n\"Isn't that embarrassing?\" Ares' face flushed. \"Do we have to keep begging Grid for everything? Every single time! Like we're completely helpless without him!\"\n\n\"It's not begging—it's reasonable compensation. The blacksmith shortage is Grid's fault. We have the right to reclaim the smiths he stole—\"\n\n\"Grid didn't *steal* anyone!\" The words burst from Ares, his embarrassment transforming to anger. \"They *chose* to leave!\"\n\nHis aides fell silent.\n\nAres sank into his chair, confronting the truth his subordinates had inadvertently revealed. The critical quality he lacked—the one that mattered most for a ruler.\n\nThe ability to inspire loyalty. To draw people to his banner not through fear or obligation, but genuine devotion.\n\n*Do I even deserve to be a king?*\n\nThe question gnawed at him. His subordinates exchanged glances, discomfort rippling through the room. They knew something Ares couldn't see in this moment—that if he truly lacked charisma, none of them would be here. Hundreds of thousands wouldn't have rallied to his cause. Kingdoms weren't built by the uninspiring.\n\n*The problem isn't you,* they thought but didn't say. *It's that Grid is completely broken.*\n\nHis ability to attract followers exceeded even Ares' considerable charisma by an order of magnitude.\n\nAmong Ares' ranks, murmurs of dissent began—not against their king, but against Grid. The man who casually triggered the exact scenarios Lauel most desired, apparently without even trying.\n\n---\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\n---\n\n\"What have you been doing?\"\n\nGrid materialized in the Vatican gardens. Damian rushed over the moment word of his arrival spread, the elders trailing behind.\n\n\"You're considered a god's benefactor?\" Damian asked, breathless. \"What did you *do*?\"\n\n\"I'll explain everything later.\" Grid's focus was singular. \"First—take me to the holy sword.\"\n\n\"The holy sword...\" Damian's expression clouded.\n\nThe blade had succumbed once more to the curse's embrace. Unable to bear the sight, the church had sealed it in an underground vault—out of sight, though never out of mind. The loss weighed heavily on every believer.\n\nWhich made what happened next all the more impossible.\n\n\"T-The holy sword!\"\n\n\"Oh...! Ohhhhh!\"\n\nDamian and the elders crowded around the pedestal, marveling. Where darkness had suffocated the blade, brilliant light now blazed. The Stone of Original Sin had vanished without trace.\n\n\"The curse—it's broken! Don't tell me...?!\" \n\nAs one, they turned to Grid.\n\nRealization swept across their faces. The person who had cleansed the holy sword stood before them, quietly observing their wonder.\n\n---\n\n*...To take away the sin of envy. You are truly a remarkable human.*\n\nThe voice of the seven malignant saints whispered through Grid's consciousness.\n\nHe smiled."
