  "content": "# Chapter: The 62nd Island\n\nThe transition was instantaneous. One moment Grid stood before the gate, the next he materialized on the 61st island.\n\n[You have entered the 61st island.]\n[The island is already purified.]\n\nGrid's jaw tightened. Just as Bini had warned.\n\nSomeone had beaten him here. The guardian no longer existed, which meant the boss monsters of these higher islands didn't respawn. It made sense—this was endgame content. If the bosses regenerated infinitely, no one would ever complete the Behen Archipelago's storyline.\n\nWhich meant whoever claimed these islands first would reap all the rewards.\n\nGrid's mind went to one person immediately: Agnus. That bastard had probably looted Lantier's legendary equipment—the cloak, the dagger. Maybe both.\n\n*Unless he took something far worse.*\n\nA chill ran down Grid's spine. What if Agnus had secured Death Knight Lantier himself? A legendary assassin serving the necromancer?\n\nNo. Grid shook his head. That was too extreme. If Agnus possessed Death Knight Lantier, surely he would have deployed him during their confrontation in the Belto Kingdom.\n\nThe meadow stretched before him, deceptively tranquil. A gentle breeze swept across the grass, carrying dandelion seeds into the air. Beyond the rolling hills, the horizon shimmered like cut gemstones. Beautiful. Peaceful.\n\nGrid barely registered any of it.\n\nHe broke into a run. Every second wasted was another second for a competitor to claim what should be his. His boots pounded against the soft earth as greed ignited in his chest.\n\n*The remaining bosses are mine.*\n\nWithout hesitation, he passed through the gate to the 62nd island.\n\n[You have entered the 62nd island.]\n\n**Tang! Tang-tang-tang!**\n\nThe world reformed around him—and four jade bullets screamed toward his face.\n\nGrid's vision had barely adjusted to the new environment when the attack came. No warning. No grace period. Just instant, lethal aggression.\n\nThis was Demon Slayer Alex's opening move. Most players wouldn't even see the bullets coming. The transition disorientation combined with Alex's monstrous attack speed created a perfect kill window. Even Agnus had been caught off-guard here.\n\nBut Grid wasn't most players.\n\n**Tatatang!**\n\nMetal rang against metal. Four golden shapes whirled around Grid's body, intercepting the bullets with mechanical precision. His God Hands moved with inhuman reflexes, their cores glowing as they absorbed the impacts.\n\nGrid's heart hammered, but his voice came out steady. Cold.\n\n\"No manners.\"\n\nHe charged forward. Textbook tactics against a ranged opponent—close the distance, eliminate the advantage. Simple. Obvious.\n\n**Clink!**\n\nToo obvious.\n\nAlex's magic engineering gun shifted, components realigning in a blur. By the time Grid reached striking range, the firearm had transformed into a sword.\n\n**Chaeeeng!**\n\nGrid's Enlightenment Blade, mounted on the Sword Ghost handle, met Alex's counter. The impact jarred Grid's arms.\n\nHis eyes widened.\n\n*What the—*\n\nAlex's blade came again. And again. And again. Four strikes in the span of a single heartbeat.\n\nGrid had assumed the rapid-fire bullets were a weapon property. A special skill. But this was different—these were basic attacks. No wind-up, no skill activation, no buffs.\n\nThe death knight simply moved that fast.\n\nHuman players and NPCs started with an attack speed of **1.0**—one attack per second. Weapons and skills could modify this, but the baseline remained constant. For Alex to achieve **0.25** attack speed meant his agility stat had to exceed **8,000**.\n\n*That shouldn't be possible.*\n\nDemon Slayers prioritized strength and intelligence. Yura was living proof. The class needed stamina for survivability, which left minimal points for agility investment.\n\n*So how?*\n\n**Jjejeong! Jjeejeeeong!**\n\nAlex pressed the assault. Each strike carried real weight—not the weak taps of an agility-focused assassin, but proper swordsman damage combined with inhuman speed.\n\nThe worst of both worlds.\n\nGrid's God Hands worked overtime, golden forms blurring as they intercepted the storm of attacks. They couldn't block everything, but they deflected enough. Grid managed to counterattack between exchanges, his blade finding gaps in Alex's offense.\n\nThen Alex fired his gun.\n\n**Kuaaaaang!**\n\nThe jade explosion consumed Grid's vision. The death knight had baited him, waiting for the exact moment Grid committed to a counter before unleashing the Demon Slayer's signature technique.\n\n*His control...*\n\nGrid gritted his teeth as explosive damage stacked. This wasn't some mindless undead. Alex fought with calculated precision, the tactical genius he'd possessed in life still intact despite death's transformation.\n\n**Chaeng! Chaeeeeeng!**\n\nBut Grid had advantages of his own. The God Hands continued their tireless defense, and Alex's attacks never landed critically. Every strike that might have crippled a normal player was intercepted by golden hands.\n\nGrid felt a surge of appreciation for his equipment.\n\n*This game truly is about items.*\n\nThen he noticed something. The God Hands' experience bar had climbed to **70%**. Each blocked attack taught them, refined their responses. If this battle lasted a full month, they'd evolve to legendary rating.\n\nBut Grid didn't have a month.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship!\"\n\nThe Enlightenment Blade ignited. Flames traced Grid's movements as he launched into the sword dance, fire coiling like a dragon's tongue.\n\n\"**Link!**\"\n\nFour attacks per second? \n\nLink delivered twenty.\n\n**Jjang! Jjeejeeeong! Pit! Pipipipipit!**\n\nAlex raised his blade, but defending against Grid's opening strikes left him vulnerable to everything that followed. A Mjolnir-wielding God Hand hammered into his ribcage, and then the Enlightenment Blade fell like rain.\n\n[You have dealt 240,555 damage to the target!]\n[You have dealt 235,900 damage to the target!]\n\n[The option effect of the Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires has added 5,000 fire damage!]\n\n[The option effect 'Black Flames' has activated from the Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires!]\n[You have dealt 3,673,800 damage to the target.]\n\n[The option effect 'Black Flames' has activated from the Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires!]\n[You have dealt 4,392,220 damage to the target.]\n\n[Critical!]\n[You have dealt 9,215,090 damage to the target.]\n\n**Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwang!**\n\nBlack flames erupted with almost every strike. The weakness of Link—its insufficient damage against boss-tier enemies—evaporated in the face of the Enlightenment Blade's explosive property. Each detonation chained into the next, turning Link into a legitimate rival for Pinnacle Kill's damage potential.\n\nGrid stood amid the firestorm, momentarily stunned by his own power.\n\n*This...*\n\nHe remembered the first time he'd wielded Failure, combining its might with the Holy Light Gloves and Kill. That moment had defined power for him. The memory of obliterating a field boss in seconds had seemed untouchable.\n\nIt meant nothing now.\n\nThe Enlightenment Blade had shown him a new ceiling.\n\n**Thud.**\n\nAlex staggered, his health bar missing a third of its length. His left arm bone clattered to the ground, blasted free by the sustained explosions. The undead's vulnerability to explosive damage rendered in stark detail.\n\nAlex stood one-armed. Silent.\n\nGrid remained silent too, lost in admiration of his own weapon.\n\n*Is this even real?*\n\nFor a heartbeat, he felt invincible. Like he could challenge even Piaro and—\n\n**Clink!**\n\nReality snapped back. Alex's remaining hand moved, the sword flowing back into gun form.\n\n**Tang! Tatatatang!**\n\nThe death knight retreated, firing controlled bursts. Every step backward came with four bullets. When he activated Continuous Fire, the rate doubled, tripled. The God Hands couldn't track them all.\n\nBullets punched through Grid's defense and tore into his flesh.\n\n\"Kuk!\"\n\nBlood sprayed. Grid's health plummeted in seconds.\n\nHe'd gotten distracted. This was the Behen Archipelago—the same instant dungeon that had broken him months ago. No time for admiration. No time for pride.\n\nGrid drew his Ideal Dagger and activated Quick Movements.\n\n[You have suffered 5,200 damage.]\n[You have suffered 4,880 damage.]\n[You have suffered 5,150 damage.]\n\nEven with Triple Layers replacing the Holy Light Gloves, Alex's bullets hit like hammers. Grid closed the gap despite the mounting damage, his health gauge—still hovering below 100,000—draining with every step.\n\nHe had one goal: kill Alex before the Immortal passive activated. With the Enlightenment Blade's attack power, it was possible.\n\nBut Alex had learned his lesson.\n\n**Peng! Pepepepeng!**\n\n[You have suffered 15,900 damage.]\n\n\"**Kuaaaaak!**\"\n\nThe mine detonated beneath Grid's boots. The blast launched him backward a full meter, his body ragdolling through the air. Hidden trap? No—planted earlier, strategically placed in Grid's most likely approach vector.\n\nA Demon Slayer's magic-infused mine carried devastating power. Even through Triple Layers, the explosion nearly killed him. If he'd been in Blackening form, he'd be dead.\n\n\"Shit...\"\n\nGrid scrambled to his feet.\n\n**Clink!**\n\nAlex's gun reconfigured. The components elongated, the barrel extending. The weapon transformed from a pistol into something far more lethal.\n\nSniper mode. A configuration even Yura couldn't access yet.\n\nThe death knight's single remaining hand steadied the rifle, barrel centering on Grid's chest.\n\n**Peeeong!**\n\nAn explosion erupted—from Alex's skull."
