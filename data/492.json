  "content": "Twenty-three hours. Two levels.\n\n\"What the hell...?\"\n\n\"This is impossible!\"\n\nThe world reeled. Satisfy experts, journalists, casual players—billions of people—watched the unified rankings refresh and stared in disbelief. No one could make sense of Grid's leveling speed.\n\nThe math didn't lie. A level 300 player needed an average of ten days to gain a single level, assuming newly discovered hunting grounds. Before those recent breakthroughs? Twenty days. *Per level*. And that was calculated based on maintaining hunting rotations even during sleep cycles using shift workers or capsule extensions.\n\nGrid had gained two levels in a single day.\n\nCommon sense shattered against that number.\n\n\"Even factoring in experience buffs, this doesn't track.\"\n\n\"Grid's loaded with special items, though. Maybe he crafted something that breaks the game's hunting mechanics?\"\n\n\"Run the numbers yourself. It still doesn't work.\"\n\nThe experts did. To raise from level 307 to 309 in twenty-three hours required slaughtering monsters worth at least three million experience each. One kill per minute. For twenty-three straight hours.\n\nChina's premier hunting analyst, Panda Dagger, called an emergency press conference.\n\n\"A level 307 to 308 player needs to hunt level 320 monsters to extract three million experience per kill.\" He gestured to a massive spreadsheet projected behind him. \"Here are the average health pools and defense ratings of every known level 320 monster currently documented. Note the numbers. These aren't trash mobs. They're high-tier predators with defensive stats that laugh at most player damage.\"\n\nHe let the numbers sink in.\n\n\"Killing one of these every sixty seconds? Impossible. Even for Grid. Sure, he might delete one or two with his legendary weapons—burst them down with ultimate skills. But sustaining that pace? For an entire day?\" Panda Dagger shook his head. \"Stamina exists. Satisfy's stamina depletion is brutal. Top rankers with maxed stamina stats and the fastest recovery rates still need breaks every four hours during intensive grinding. Grid never stopped. Not once, according to the level gain timestamps.\"\n\nThe room buzzed with whispers.\n\n\"And that's *assuming* he's hunting level 320s. The actual answer is probably worse.\"\n\n---\n\nThe truth?\n\nGrid *did* rest. Stamina crushed everyone equally, even legends. But his leveling speed had nothing to do with efficiency rotations or min-maxed stamina management.\n\n> [A junior vampire has been destroyed.]  \n> [Experience acquired: 4,951,000]\n\n> [An intermediate vampire has been destroyed.]  \n> [Experience acquired: 7,254,300]\n\n> [A senior vampire has been destroyed.]  \n> [Experience acquired: 11,000,050]\n\n> [The True Blood vampire **Pok** has been destroyed!]  \n> [Experience acquired: 59,970,111]\n\nThe 7th Vampire City. Average monster level: 300 to 360. Vampires were classified as a top-tier combat species, their experience yields vastly exceeding standard monsters of equivalent level. And True Blood vampires? Those quasi-boss entities were nightmares to solo. Most players avoided them entirely.\n\nGrid was farming them on a per-minute basis.\n\nSometimes per *second*.\n\n\"Nyahahat! Taste the super ultra mega punch of hell's greatest demonic beast! Nyang!\"\n\n*Dok.*\n\nNoe's tiny paw tapped a vampire's forehead. The creature blinked, more confused than hurt.\n\nThen the claws came.\n\n\"*Kyaaack!*\"\n\nThe vampire's face shredded. It tumbled backward, screaming, blood spraying from deep gashes.\n\n*Memphis. The great demon's pet is vicious.*\n\nBraham's thoughts dripped with disdain. The creature called it a 'punch' to lure opponents into dropping their guard.\n\n*Cute. Adorable, actually. Now I understand why the great demons treasure them.*\n\nA flicker of longing crossed Braham's consciousness. He wanted one.\n\nBefore the thought fully formed—\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship.\"\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship.\"\n\n\"**Kill.**\"\n\n\"**Kill.**\"\n\n*Puok!*\n\nRandy, wearing Grid's copied face, and Grid himself unleashed identical techniques. Two blades. Two vampires. Both exploded into ash.\n\n\"You *bastards!*\"\n\nThe remaining vampires shrieked, rushing forward. The **God Hands** swung their hammers in tight arcs, golden light flaring. The vampires skidded to a halt, hissing.\n\n\"What the—!?\"\n\nMjolnir's trajectory was absolute. No dodging. One hit led to another. The divine-forged hammers carved through undead flesh, searing with holy power.\n\n\"They're too scattered.\" Grid scowled, watching vampires cling to pillars, ceilings, and stairwells. \"High-intelligence monsters are a pain in the ass.\"\n\nSpeed was everything. But the vampires refused to close the distance, using architecture as cover. Chasing them down individually would waste time.\n\n\"Assimilation.\"\n\nMana surged. Grid's broad shoulders narrowed. His thick forearms became elegant, almost delicate. His jawline sharpened, and his black hair bled white as fresh snow.\n\n> [Your class is now **Great Magician**.]  \n> [Available skill list has been updated.]  \n> [You have lost control of your body for 3 minutes.]\n\n\"Fakes. Worthless imitations.\"\n\nOnly the nine children directly born from Shizo Beriache deserved the title of *vampire*.\n\n*Ssik!*\n\nThe white-haired Grid grinned, fingers outstretched toward the ceiling. Master-level <span class=\"skill\">**Magic Missile (Enhanced)**</span> erupted from his palm.\n\n*Kwa kwa kwa kwang!*\n\n\"*Kyaak!*\"\n\n\"*Kuaaack!*\"\n\nThe vampires dangling like bats couldn't react. White magic tore through them, bodies plummeting through smoke and debris. Blood rained across the hall.\n\nThe white-haired Grid glowed red. His eyes swept the room, and every vampire in range froze.\n\n\"Great blood...!\"\n\n\"T-The scent of *nobility!*\"\n\nNot human? Confusion rippled through the horde.\n\n*Pepeng!*\n\n*Pepepepeok!*\n\nThe white-haired Grid wore <span class=\"item\">**Malacus' Cloak**</span>, the <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">**Holy Light Crown**</span>, and the **Black Quartz Earrings** (Intelligence +15%). His Intelligence stat shattered 2,000. Master-level <span class=\"skill\">**Fireball (Enhanced)**</span> detonated in every direction, a storm of incinerating mana. The <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">**Ring of Absurdity**</span> cut resource consumption in half, fueling an endless bombardment.\n\n*Kurururung!*\n\n\"*Aaaaack!*\"\n\nScreams echoed through the burning structure. The 7th Vampire City turned into hell.\n\n\"What—?\"\n\n\"*Enemy invasion!!*\"\n\nThirteen buildings dotted the city. The moment the commotion started, every vampire within range stirred. Thousands poured from doorways, windows, and cracked walls.\n\nGrid crouched in the ruined building's shadow, eyes wide.\n\n\"Holy shit...\"\n\nA tsunami of vampires flooded the streets. The **Assimilation** timer expired mid-thought.\n\n\"What the hell is this?! Are you insane?!\" Grid's voice cracked. He'd wanted faster kills, not a city-wide genocide trigger. \"Why did you *destroy the building?!*\"\n\nBraham's voice echoed in his skull, cautious. *Are you unable to handle it?*\n\nGrid didn't hesitate.\n\n\"Of course I can't! Damn it!\"\n\nThousands of vampires at once? Grid wasn't Kraugel. Even *Kraugel* couldn't solo this.\n\n*I apologize.*\n\n\"Aish! Move to a chokepoint!\"\n\nGrid summoned the **God Hands**' defensive formation and sprinted. \n\n\"*Kahahahat!*\"\n\n\"The little bug is running!\"\n\nThe vampire horde surged, starved for prey. Claws and fangs slashed toward his back.\n\n*Chaaeng!*\n\n*Chaeeeeeng!*\n\n\"What—!\"\n\nThe **God Hands** weaved through the chaos, hammers deflecting strikes with inhuman precision. But physical attacks weren't the problem.\n\nMagic was.\n\n*Kwa kwang!*\n\n*Kwa kwa kwa kwang!*\n\nSpells detonated around Grid in overlapping waves of fire, ice, and shadow.\n\n\"Ugh.\"\n\nThe <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">**Holy Light Set**</span> absorbed some of the damage. Not enough. Hundreds of spells per second, cast by monsters whose base stats dwarfed ordinary level 300 mobs. A normal ranker couldn't handle five vampires simultaneously. Grid was fighting *thousands*.\n\nHis health bar plummeted.\n\n*Shit. I was saving this for the city boss.*\n\nNo choice. Braham had forced his hand.\n\n\"**Item Transformation!**\"\n\n> **[Item Transformation]**  \n> A skill triggered when possessing the legendary mineral **'pavranium'**.  \n> Transforms pavranium into the shape and performance of a specific item.  \n> * Can only transform into items you have learned to craft.  \n> * Duration: 3 minutes. After release, pavranium returns to original form.  \n> Skill Mana Cost: None.  \n> Skill Cooldown: 6 hours.\n\n> [Select an item for transformation.]\n\nBefore Grid could respond, a spell detonated against his chest. Blood sprayed from his mouth. He barked orders through the pain.\n\n\"Throw the Mjolnirs!\"\n\n*Hwiririk!*\n\nThe **God Hands** hooked their fingers through the red cords looped at each hammer's base. They hurled the weapons in unison.\n\n*Peok!*\n\n*Pepepepeok!*\n\nThe 'increased acceleration when thrown' option turned each hammer into a meteor. Grey flashes tore through vampire formations. Bodies disintegrated. Grid's experience bar spiked.\n\n*If only it had AoE divine damage. Wait. Isn't Mjolnir the God of Thunder's weapon?*\n\nHe filed the thought away. Add <span class=\"item\">**ure stone**</span> for lightning attribute. Combine divine damage with AoE electric shocks. Apply rigid status on every hit.\n\n*Pair that with the stiffness effect? Actually broken.*\n\nGrid's mind raced even as he answered the system prompt.\n\n\"<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">**Lifael's Spear**</span>.\"\n\nA replica. A fake. But the base design came from Rebecca's divine artifact. Pavranium construction meant autonomous movement.\n\n\"*Go!*\"\n\n*Kwa kwa kwa kwang!*\n\nFour **God Hands** transformed into holy lances. They punched through the vampire swarm like ballistic missiles. Notification windows flooded Grid's vision, too fast to read.\n\n---\n\n\"So what's your thesis?\"\n\n\"Are you questioning Grid's abnormal leveling speed?\"\n\n\"Do you believe Grid exploited a bug, like the internet claims?\"\n\nThe press conference devolved into chaos. Reporters shouted over each other, cameras flashing. Panda Dagger leaned back, savoring the attention.\n\n\"Bugs don't exist in Satisfy. Morpheus manages the entire system. And even if one slipped through, do you think Grid is dumb enough to broadcast it?\" He paused for effect. \"I'm here to discuss the **Reputation Store**.\"\n\n\"Reputation Store...\"\n\n\"Exactly. The legendary shop only accessible to the continent's top players. It's obvious Grid bought experience potions from there. He stacked the National Competition's experience buff with multiple potion effects to achieve this leveling speed.\"\n\nThe logic held. Murmurs of agreement swept the room.\n\n\"However.\" Panda Dagger raised a finger. \"Obtaining experience potions requires gambling with the shop's drawing system. The drop rate is abysmal. Even if Grid liquidated his entire reputation pool, he couldn't stockpile more than a handful.\"\n\nHe leaned forward.\n\n\"Translation: Grid's leveling myth ends the moment those potions run out. He'll revert to a standard ranker's pace. Maybe *slower*, given how much reputation he burned.\"\n\n\"Ohhh...\"\n\nThe reporters scribbled furiously. Within minutes, headlines spread across international gaming sites:\n\n**'Grid's Leveling Myth: Just a One-Night Dream'**"
