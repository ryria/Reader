Every item he'd crafted before bore the same damning phrase: *made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but lacks experience and reputation.*\n\nNow the text read differently: *a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.*\n\n*Somewhat.*\n\nHe ran his thumb across the flat of the blade. It was a minor change. Trivial, even. But the system had acknowledged him, if only fractionally.\n\nThe new hammer helped. The <span class=\"rarity-epic\">Unknown Blacksmith's Hammer</span> boosted his odds of producing rare and epic items, driving down the probability of trash-tier Normal junk. He should have prioritized getting a proper production tool months ago instead of gambling on equipment upgrades.\n\n*Too late for regrets. Time to monetize.*\n\nGrid turned toward the furnace, mentally cataloging materials. Epic items sold for decent gold. Unique items could set him up for weeks. Legendary...\n\n\"Grid.\"\n\nKhan's voice cut through his calculations. The old man stood in the doorway, backlit by afternoon sun filtering through Winston's streets.\n\n\"Will you come to my son's grave with me?\" Khan asked. \"Today is the anniversary of his death.\"\n\nGrid's jaw clenched. Every minute away from the anvil was money lost. He had a stockpile of iron to process, orders to fill, a growing mental list of items that would attract buyers.\n\nBut Khan's expression stopped the refusal in his throat.\n\n*My only friend is an NPC. How depressing is that?*\n\nGrid set down the hammer. \"Let's go.\"\n\n***\n\nThe hill north of Winston barely qualified as a cemetery. Ten graves, maybe twelve, scattered across weedy ground that someone had given up maintaining years ago. Grid picked his way between the markers, noting their weathered state.\n\n*This is pathetic. Too small. Too forgotten.*\n\nKhan moved past him toward a particular headstone. \"This is where my son rests. My ancestors as well. Seven generations of my family, all in one place.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Grid didn't know what else to say.\n\nKhan knelt before his son's grave. A smile crossed his face, sad and distant. \"My son had excellent qualities as a blacksmith. I never doubted he would surpass me. Perhaps even achieve the same reputation as Albatino.\"\n\nTears welled in the old man's eyes.\n\n\"The pain of losing a son...\" Khan's voice fractured. \"It has been ten years, but I still miss him. I still feel regret. If I could revive him, even at the cost of my own life, I would do it without hesitation.\"\n\nGrid stood awkwardly to the side. What the hell was he supposed to say? He had no experience with this kind of grief. No framework to understand a parent burying their child. He shifted his weight, acutely aware of his own uselessness.\n\nKhan laughed suddenly, wiping his eyes. \"I'm glad you're here.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Every day, I couldn't work properly. Nostalgia and despair.\" Khan straightened, looking at Grid with red-rimmed eyes. \"But meeting you changed something. I felt surprised. Excited. I even stopped drinking because of you.\" He gestured toward the gravestone. \"Say hello to my son.\"\n\nKhan faced the marker again, speaking as though his son could hear.\n\n\"This is Pagma's Descendant, the one I told you about every night.\" His voice brightened with forced cheer. \"Isn't it amazing to meet him? Are you surprised? Can you believe such a person is with your father?\"\n\n\"Khan...\"\n\nThe old man's composure shattered. He sank to his knees, arms wrapping around the cold stone. \"Don't worry! Your father is doing well, so don't worry! This great person is taking care of me! He promised to maintain the smithy! So rest easy... rest in peace...\"\n\nKhan's shoulders shook with silent sobs.\n\nGrid looked away. Damn S.A. Group and their neural algorithms. Every NPC had depth like this. Backstories. Grief. Living, breathing personalities that made them feel real.\n\n*They should dial it back.*\n\nHis vision blurred. Dust in his eyes, probably. He tilted his head toward the sky, blinking rapidly. The lump in his throat refused to dissolve.\n\n\"Your father is my most precious friend,\" Grid said quietly. \"I'll treat him well. I'll make the smithy the best in Winston. So... like he said, rest in peace.\"\n\n> [The bond between you and Khan has deepened.]\n\n> [The souls of Khan's ancestors are thrilled by your emotions towards Khan and emerge from underground.]\n\n\"What?\"\n\nTen blue lights materialized in front of him, coalescing into humanoid shapes. Translucent. Glowing. Floating two feet off the ground.\n\nThey spoke in unison, their voices overlapping like wind chimes. \"It is good to meet you, Pagma's Descendant. Friend of our descendant.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" Grid stumbled backward. \"Khan! KHAN!\"\n\nThe old man had collapsed against the gravestone, snoring softly.\n\n\"Are you serious?!\" Grid hissed. \"How do you fall asleep that fast?\"\n\nKhan didn't stir. The ghosts drifted closer.\n\n*I'm alone with ghosts. I'm the only one who can see them.*\n\nGrid's fists clenched. His breathing quickened. \"Come on! You evil spirits! I'll survive to the end of the horror movie!\"\n\nThe panic wasn't entirely irrational. When he was eight years old, he'd seen something in his grandmother's house. White cloth. Pale hands. A face that shouldn't have existed. Everyone said he'd imagined it, that kids see things in shadows.\n\nBut he remembered.\n\nThe blue souls paused, seemingly confused by his fighting stance.\n\n\"You...\" Grid forced the words out. \"Are you really ghosts?\"\n\n\"You could say that,\" one responded.\n\n\"No. Absolutely not.\" Grid shook his head violently. \"Ghosts don't exist. That thing I saw as a kid wasn't real. This isn't real.\"\n\nThe spirits laughed, a sound like distant bells. \"What doesn't exist in this world? You think ghosts are the strange part?\"\n\nGrid stopped. \"Ah.\"\n\n*Right. This is Satisfy, you idiot.*\n\nThe world had walking skeletons. Fire-breathing lizards. People who shot lightning from their hands. Existence here didn't follow the same rules as reality. This was all code. Artificial. Created by humans.\n\nGhosts fit right in.\n\n\"So what do you want?\" Grid asked.\n\n\"We have come to give you a reward,\" they said. \"You showed true heart to our descendants. This deserves recognition.\"\n\n*Reward?* Grid's anxiety evaporated instantly. \"Is it gold?\"\n\nThe largest soul drifted forward. \"I am the one who witnessed Pagma's swordsmanship 130 years ago.\"\n\nGrid's breath caught. \"...!\"\n\n\"I saw the beauty of Pagma's swordsmanship, how it pierced the sky.\" The ghost's voice carried reverence. \"I was so fascinated that I ran to Kesan Canyon immediately. I drew what I'd seen on the northern cliff, because the image burned in my mind. I couldn't sleep until I'd captured it.\"\n\nThe class quest. The one Grid had stalled on because he had no leads.\n\n\"The painting will help you learn Pagma's swordsmanship,\" the ghost said.\n\n> [The quest 'Pagma's Descendant' has been updated.]\n>\n> **[Pagma's Descendant]**\n>\n> Difficulty: Class Quest\n>\n> You have inherited Pagma's blacksmith skills. But do you truly know who Pagma was? Can you carry out his will with pride?\n>\n> Pagma was not simply a blacksmith with exceptional technique. If that were all, his legends would not be scattered across the continent.\n>\n> Begin with the clue of the swordsmanship that pierced the sky. Follow Pagma's legend. Collect all the pieces, and you will understand him. Only then can you succeed his will.\n>\n> At that moment, a new legend will be born.\n>\n> * No time limit for this class quest.\n> * Accepting a legendary class quest prevents class changes.\n> * Legendary class quests have the power to transform Satisfy's world based on results.\n>\n> **Class Quest Clear Conditions:** Complete all linked quests successfully.\n>\n> **Class Quest Clear Reward:** Unknown.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **First Class Quest: [Pagma's Swordsmanship]**\n>\n> The witness to Pagma's swordsmanship from 130 years ago has appeared and provided a clue.\n>\n> Travel to Kesan Canyon south of Winston. You will find a clue to Pagma's swordsmanship carved on the northern cliff.\n>\n> **First Class Quest Clear Condition:** Learn Pagma's swordsmanship.\n>\n> **First Class Quest Clear Reward:** <span class=\"rarity-unique\">Dainsleif (Reproduction)</span>.\n\nThe notification faded. The souls began to dissipate.\n\n\"Pagma's Descendant is a friend of our descendant,\" they said. \"We pray you will become greater than Pagma himself. Now we return to where we belong.\"\n\nOne by one, the blue lights winked out. The last soul lingered, its voice softer than the others.\n\n\"Thank you for looking after my father.\"\n\nThen it vanished.\n\nThe hill fell silent. Dusk had given way to full night while Grid stood transfixed. The remnants of the souls scattered like falling stars, blue motes of light drifting on the wind.\n\nKhan stirred. \"Mmm? Did I fall asleep? Is it night already?\"\n\nGrid rubbed his face. \"Old man, you have a habit of passing out anywhere. It's terrible for your health.\"\n\n\"I was never like this before...\" Khan frowned, then his eyes went wide. \"Wait! Why is the area around your crotch damp?!\"\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\n***\n\nForty days had passed since Huroi cleared the 'Wait' quest.\n\nS.A. Group had immediately swarmed him. A week in the hospital for health checks. Another week answering questions while lawyers hovered with NDAs and publicity contracts. He'd agreed to let them announce his identity as the first user with a second class, which meant interviews and photo shoots and manufactured hype.\n\nThen Huroi spent twenty-three days riding across Mongolia on horseback, reconnecting with his nomadic roots. The steppes had cleared his head. Grounded him.\n\nHe'd returned to Satisfy three days ago, dedicating himself to understanding his new class: <span class=\"rarity-epic\">Apostle of Justice's Partner</span>.\n\nToday, he would finally reunite with the man he'd sworn to serve.\n\nHuroi stood outside Khan's smithy, heart pounding. *Will he be pleased to see me? Or angry that I waited so long?*\n\nHe swallowed hard. Hesitated. Reached for the door.\n\nIt swung open before he could knock.\n\nGrid stepped out, head down, muttering something about ore quality. He walked right past Huroi without looking up.\n\n\"My Liege!\" Huroi called out.\n\nGrid didn't react. He kept walking.\n\n*Does he not recognize the title?*\n\n\"Mr. Grid!\"\n\nGrid stopped. Turned. Their eyes met.\n\nHuroi rushed forward and dropped to one knee, head bowed in the posture of a knight before his king. \"Have you been well? I apologize for the lack of contact!\"\n\n\"...Huroi?\"\n\n\"Yes, My Liege. It's me.\"\n\nHuroi had sacrificed himself in the dungeon, allowing Grid to escape four knights. Grid must have worried about him. Probably assumed the worst. Now Huroi could reassure him that...\n\nGrid's hand shot out and seized Huroi's throat.\n\n\"You son of a bitch!\" Grid yanked him upright, face contorted with rage. \"Do I know you? I don't! Those knights connected you to me somehow, and I paid the price! I got disqualified from the item production game! Shoved into a ridiculous quest! They gagged me and locked me in solitary confinement, then made me fight someone called the Northern Nova! Do you have any idea what I went through?!\"\n\nHuroi blinked, stunned. This wasn't... Grid wasn't supposed to...\n\n\"I'm sorry!\" Huroi blurted. \"I was wrong, My Liege!\"\n\n*My master is my sky. If he's angry, I must have failed him.*\n\nGrid's expression shifted from fury to confusion. His grip loosened. \"What?\"\n\n*He seems disturbed.* Grid frowned, studying Huroi like a broken piece of equipment. *This guy seemed normal when we first met. Now he's acting like a complete lunatic. Did they torture him in prison? Break his mind?*\n\nGrid released Huroi's neck and waved dismissively. \"Yeah, fine. I get it. Now leave.\"\n\nHuroi's eyes widened. \"Leave? Where?\"\n\n\"Anywhere.\"\n\n\"My path is with My Liege!\"\n\nThe descendants of the Blue Wolf never broke their oaths. Huroi had pledged loyalty to Grid. That bond was eternal. Besides, his second class literally required proximity to the Apostle of Justice. All his stats increased by 20% when they were together.\n\nGrid's eye twitched. \"You're insane.\"\n\n\"Are you part of a guild, My Liege?\" Huroi pressed. \"If so, please allow me to join. Shouldn't we be in the same guild?\"\n\n\"I don't have a guild. So leave.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" Huroi brightened. \"Are you planning to form one? With your reputation, many would follow. I'll assist you in recruiting!\"\n\nGrid pinched the bridge of his nose. He needed to get to Kesan Canyon before wasting more daylight. Mining first, then travel. He didn't have time for Huroi's deranged chatter.\n\n\"Stop talking nonsense and move.\" Grid stepped around him. \"I'm leaving.\"\n\nHe strode toward the northern gate.\n\nHuroi watched him go, conflicted. Grid clearly wanted distance. But the Apostle of Justice needed his Partner. Huroi's duty was clear.\n\nHe followed at a discreet distance.\n\nThe journey was... cursed.\n\nOn a flat road, Grid tripped over invisible obstacles. When Grid tried to cook meat, a sudden rainstorm appeared from a cloudless sky, dousing the flames. In areas famous for being peaceful, bandits materialized from nowhere.\n\n*This man has catastrophically bad luck,* Huroi realized. *If he sleeps, he'll probably break his nose.*\n\nA burning sense of duty filled Huroi's chest.\n\n*I must protect him.*\n\nThe Apostle of Justice's Partner existed to support the Apostle of Justice. Huroi no longer doubted his path.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**\n\n**OG:** Glossary Link.\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\n**Check out my Patreon** for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
