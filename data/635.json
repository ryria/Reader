  "content": "**Chapter: Divided Loyalties**\n\n\"So... what was the Overgeared King's response?\"\n\nInside Sword Duke Limit's training grounds, four blades danced through the air like deadly specters. Each strike carved trenches into the earth, devastating the field with terrifying precision. This was the swordsmanship Limit had honed for decades—technique he believed surpassed even the legendary Sword Saint Muller and the great swordsman Piaro. Yet without the achievements to match his skill, he remained trapped in the purgatory between master and legend.\n\nMercedes knelt amid the settling dust, her white armor caked with dirt. \"He accepted the terms.\"\n\nLimit's swords clattered to the ground. \"He... *accepted*?\" Disbelief colored his voice as he stared at his subordinate. \"The same man who faced down one hundred thousand troops single-handedly just... capitulated? No resistance? No defiance?\"\n\n\"On the surface, yes. He was quiet. Compliant, even.\"\n\n\"But underneath?\"\n\nMercedes lifted her gaze. \"Underneath? Grid is a beast that refuses the leash. He knelt, yes—but his eyes never left the emperor's throat.\"\n\n\"Asmophel's Eyes.\"\n\nThe phrase carried weight among the imperial knights. It described that particular look—the unbroken gaze of someone who accepts temporary defeat while already plotting their rise. It was the expression Asmophel had worn when watching Piaro, back when the hierarchy between them had seemed unbreakable.\n\nA slow smile crossed Limit's face. \"Good. That's the man I expected him to be.\"\n\nTo any observer, the scene would have been incomprehensible. Limit was one of six imperial dukes, outwardly the most loyal servant of the Saharan Empire. Why would he be *pleased* that Grid hadn't truly submitted?\n\nBut Mercedes understood perfectly.\n\nThe Red Knights weren't forged by Emperor Juander—they were Empress Marie's creation. On paper, they answered to the throne. In practice, they were extensions of the empress herself. And Limit, as their commander, danced to her tune.\n\nIt hadn't always been this way. When first appointed, Limit had given the emperor his genuine loyalty. But Juander had squandered that gift.\n\nThe Five Pillars. Five brilliant individuals the emperor lauded as the pillars supporting the empire—and valued far more than his own Red Knights. The slight had festered like a wound, and now Limit's allegiance had shifted entirely.\n\n\"Mercedes.\" Limit's voice dropped to something conspiratorial. \"When you report to His Majesty, emphasize Grid's threat. Convince him that troops must be dispatched immediately to crush the Overgeared Kingdom. While the emperor focuses his attention there, Empress Marie will have the breathing room she needs to consolidate her political position.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nMercedes bowed and departed, but her thoughts churned as she rode her white horse toward the imperial palace.\n\n*Is this truly what's best for the empire?*\n\nDeceiving the emperor. Fanning the flames of succession crisis. The political factions were already at each other's throats over the crown prince selection—was widening that divide wise? Or were they tearing the empire apart from within?\n\nShe didn't notice the eyes that followed her every movement.\n\n*My goddess...*\n\nSky, Mercedes' retainer, watched from the shadows. As an unofficial ranker, he'd operated in the empire since Satisfy's launch, clawing his way up from the Black Knights to his current position as a Red Knights reserve. His skill had earned him a place beside the First Knight.\n\nBut skill wasn't what drove him.\n\n*I'll stand by your side forever, Mercedes.*\n\nHis smile was rapturous as he watched her ride away. She was beautiful—devastatingly so. His love for her ran deep, as profound as the legendary devotion Damian held for Isabel.\n\nBut unlike Damian's pure faith, Sky's love was tainted.\n\n*One day, my goddess... I'll make you mine. Completely.*\n\n---\n\n**East Continent**\n\n\"Well, hello there, Grid.\"\n\n\"...Mm?\"\n\nGrid's hand moved toward his weapon. Here on the East Continent, where player presence was less than point-one percent, anonymity should have been guaranteed. NPCs rarely looked twice at him, and fellow players were almost nonexistent. Yet this stranger had identified him instantly.\n\nThe man approaching wore an easy smile and carried himself with the confidence of someone used to making friends. Above his head, the name floated clearly: *Muto*.\n\nA player. Which meant he was either very skilled or very dangerous to have made it this far east.\n\nGrid's eyes narrowed as Muto closed the distance without hesitation, that friendly expression never wavering. *Too friendly. Usually means trouble.* It was prejudice, perhaps—but prejudice born from hard experience. Satisfy wasn't the kind of world where strangers in foreign lands could be trusted on principle.\n\nMore concerning were the eight individuals flanking Muto.\n\nGrid activated **Legendary Blacksmith's Eyes**, studying them for three seconds each. The skill let him glimpse equipment details, and what he saw made his jaw tighten. Every single one of Muto's companions was at least level 280.\n\n*Someone commanding this caliber of escort isn't ordinary.*\n\n\"Relax, relax!\" Muto raised his hands in a placating gesture. \"I'm not much of a fighter, honestly. Pure merchant build. Made it here through charisma stats and deep pockets.\" He gestured to himself with false modesty. \"I run the Muto Company—yes, named after yours truly. A man's allowed a little vanity, right?\"\n\n\"Clearly,\" Grid replied, not lowering his guard an inch.\n\nMuto scratched the back of his head. \"I'm nowhere near the Unified Rankings like you, but check the merchant rankings if you're curious. I show up there.\"\n\n\"Oh...?\"\n\nGrid pulled up the interface and felt his eyebrows rise. Third place. Muto wasn't exaggerating.\n\n*So he genuinely runs a company. And Lauel's been saying we need to attract more merchants to grow the economy...*\n\nThe Overgeared Kingdom's economic limitations were well-documented. Most merchants avoided it entirely, preferring the empire's massive markets. From a business perspective, Grid's kingdom offered little profit potential.\n\n*If I'm going to build something sustainable, I need connections like this.*\n\nGrid schooled his features into something marginally less hostile and extended his hand. \"Grid.\"\n\n\"The honor is mine, Your Majesty!\" Muto's handshake was enthusiastic, his merchant's cheer practically radiating from him. \"King of the Overgeared Kingdom, pioneer of legends—truly, this is a privilege!\"\n\nProfessional enthusiasm. Grid could respect that. \"Who are they?\" He nodded toward the eight escorts.\n\n\"Mercenaries I hired locally. East Continent monsters are brutal—West Continent muscle doesn't cut it out here.\" Muto glanced at Grid's own small party. \"I'm heading to Kars to meet with the Cho King, establish some trade routes. You as well?\"\n\n\"Kars, yes.\"\n\n\"Business with the king?\"\n\nGrid's expression soured slightly. \"...It's complicated.\"\n\nHis quest was to rescue Han Seokbong and his daughter, which might very well put him at odds with Cho's ruler. Muto, reading the shift in Grid's demeanor with a merchant's practiced eye, laughed knowingly.\n\n\"Ah, so not a diplomatic mission then? I'd assumed the Overgeared King was here to forge international relations.\"\n\n\"I'd prefer that outcome, but circumstances may not allow it.\"\n\nRevealing more felt unwise. Muto seemed to sense the boundary and pivoted smoothly. \"And your companions?\" His gaze shifted to Idan and Yang Fei. \"Interesting choices. I wouldn't have expected... well, a middle-aged man and a young woman as Grid's escort across the deadliest continent.\"\n\n\"They're not my guards.\" Grid gestured to each in turn. \"Idan is my personal chef. Yang Fei, my tea master.\"\n\n\"Your... what?\"\n\n\"Chef and tea master.\"\n\nMuto blinked. \"For adventuring?\"\n\n\"I like good food and better tea.\"\n\nFor a moment, Muto was speechless. How many players in all of Satisfy could claim to travel with a dedicated culinary staff? Wealthy players hired cooks for city mansions, sure—but taking them into the field? And a *tea master*? \n\n*So this is what it means to think like royalty. The scale is just... different.*\n\nEveryone knew the Overgeared Kingdom was cash-strapped. But the kingdom's poverty didn't necessarily reflect Grid's personal wealth. Rumors suggested he'd funded much of the nation-building from his own considerable fortune.\n\n*I need to cultivate this relationship.*\n\nIn trade, connections with the wealthy were gold. Connections with wealthy *monarchs* were platinum.\n\n\"Would you care for lunch?\" Idan materialized at Muto's elbow, offering a steaming bowl of soup.\n\n\"I—really? You're sure?\"\n\n\"I made extra. Plenty to spare.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't say no to a free meal!\"\n\nWho could? Muto accepted the bowl gratefully. The moment it came close, a sharp, acrid scent hit his nostrils—but his stamina was low from travel, and he was genuinely hungry. He raised the bowl and drank deeply.\n\nThen the world became pain.\n\n**[You have consumed something fundamentally inedible.]**  \n**[Poison (Severe) applied.]**  \n**[You are losing 1,840 HP per second. Skin deterioration has begun.]**\n\n\"*Gkkk—!*\"\n\nMuto's health bar plummeted. Panicking, he fumbled through his inventory and chugged the highest-grade antidote he owned—an expensive luxury he'd been saving for emergencies.\n\n\"What the—what *was* that?!\"\n\nHad Grid just tried to assassinate him via soup? Muto's eyes snapped to the king, accusation forming—\n\n\"Tch. Philistine. You spit out my finest work and call it poison.\" Idan sniffed disdainfully. \"No appreciation for culinary art whatsoever.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Oh. Oh no.*\n\nRealization dawned. This wasn't an attack—this was just Idan being Idan. Muto looked at Grid with newfound horror.\n\n*He hired a walking health hazard as his personal chef... which means his sense of taste is completely broken.*\n\nGrid must have suffered his way through life without ever experiencing truly good food. A tragic existence. Muto felt a pang of genuine sympathy. *Poor bastard.*\n\n\"Actually,\" Muto said carefully, \"if you don't mind, could we travel together? We're headed to the same place, even if our business differs. I'd... appreciate the company. And the opportunity to get to know the Overgeared King better.\"\n\n\"Fine by me. But we're not forming a party—I'm not sharing experience.\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"However, if you enable party leader loot distribution, I'll reconsider. Your escorts look useful.\"\n\n\"...I'll pass, thanks.\"\n\n\"Refusing my generosity?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"I'll distribute items *fairly*.\"\n\nMuto sighed. \"...Fine. But a king surely wouldn't cheat a merchant, right?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n---\n\nFive days of travel followed. During that time, Grid worked to cultivate Muto's merchant expertise and connections, while Muto carefully analyzed Grid's words and vision for the Overgeared Kingdom's economic future.\n\nBy the time Kars appeared on the horizon, Muto had made his decision.\n\n\"Would the Overgeared Kingdom be open to hosting the Muto Company as a permanent fixture?\"\n\nGrid tried not to let his satisfaction show. Opportunity had literally walked into his lap.\n\nAnd along the way, he'd learned some valuable lessons, courtesy of his new merchant friend:\n\nFirst—there were methods to travel between continents without expensive scrolls.\n\nSecond—the Saharan Empire's economic power dwarfed even his grimmest estimates.\n\nThird—consistent exposure to Idan's cooking would, apparently, grant poison resistance to anyone without passive immunities.\n\nAll in all, a profitable partnership."
