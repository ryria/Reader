  "content": "\"Hmm...\"\n\nShin Youngwoo stood before his refrigerator, trapped in a dilemma that had consumed the better part of twenty minutes. Lettuce wraps. That's what he'd promised himself for breakfast. Fresh, crisp lettuce wrapped around savory tuna—simple perfection.\n\nBut the lettuce needed washing.\n\nHis gaze drifted to the unopened can of tuna on the counter. One pull of the tab, one fork, one less dish to clean. His hand reached for the can opener.\n\n*Just skip the lettuce,* his brain suggested helpfully. *Academia says modern organic pesticides make washing vegetables unnecessary anyway. Studies prove it's safe. A little soil never hurt anyone. You're a modern man. Modern men optimize.*\n\nThe rationalization continued for several more seconds before Youngwoo's shoulders sagged in defeat. He grabbed the lettuce, turned on the tap, and began meticulously washing each leaf.\n\n*Can't do it. I won't do it.*\n\nPerhaps it was all the mental energy he poured into Satisfy, but lately he'd found himself craving normalcy. Structure. The simple discipline of doing things *properly*—even something as mundane as preparing a meal.\n\n*If I start cutting corners here, where does it end?*\n\nTwenty minutes later, he sat contentedly at his small kitchen table, working through his lettuce wraps with mechanical efficiency. \n\nTo an outside observer, the scene would have been surreal. Shin Youngwoo—the legendary blacksmith, master of the Overgeared Guild, ruler of the Overgeared Kingdom—could have purchased any restaurant in Seoul. Instead, he wore a threadbare shirt that probably cost less than a single tuna sashimi course, eating canned fish in a modest apartment while his younger sister Sehee attended her university classes.\n\nHe preferred it this way. Always had.\n\nFancy food? He'd grown up poor. His palate had been formed in leaner times, and those were the flavors that still satisfied him. Expensive clothes? Everyone already knew who he was. His face was luxury enough. A maid service? He did his own housework. Sehee helped. It kept them grounded.\n\n\"Perfect.\" Youngwoo rinsed his dishes and dried his hands, his mind already shifting gears. Three months of deliberation had finally crystallized into a decision. \"Time to make new boots.\"\n\nBraham's Boots had served him well—brilliantly, even. He'd worn them for a decade of in-game time, only briefly switching to Grid's Boots before returning to the originals. The Fly magic alone made them irreplaceable. Freedom from terrain constraints, unlimited vertical mobility—only a handful of great magicians possessed anything comparable.\n\nBut their base statistics had become a liability. The level requirement was laughably low, the defense inadequate for his current threats. He'd known this for a long time.\n\nNow, finally, he had an alternative.\n\nGreed's default properties included flight. Not quite the same as Fly, but combined with his Dragon Wings, it would more than compensate. The real challenge had been the black mithril from Basara—he'd hoped to embed spells directly into the material, but his experiments had proven it impossible. Black mithril absorbed properties and attributes readily enough, but spells and skills were a different category of magic entirely.\n\n*Still,* he thought as he completed his push-ups and stepped under a cold shower, *property absorption alone is game-breaking. Wanting more would just be greedy.*\n\nHe smirked at his own unintentional pun, toweled off, and climbed into his capsule.\n\nTime to work.\n\n***\n\n\"The Violet Kingdom dispatched envoys to every nation on the continent.\" Lauel appeared in the smithy doorway within minutes of Grid's login, documents already in hand. \"They're calling for a unified military alliance.\"\n\nGrid glanced up from the forge, wiping soot from his hands. \"The orcs?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\" Lauel stepped inside, letting the door close behind him. \"The twilight orcs are tearing through their eastern provinces. The Violet court is... desperate.\"\n\n\"So they want charity dressed up as alliance politics.\" Grid set down his tools. \"No payment, no formal debt. Just vague promises of future cooperation.\"\n\nLauel's eyebrows rose slightly. \"Their exact strategy, yes. You've been following the situation more closely than I thought.\"\n\n\"I pay attention when millions of gold are involved.\" Grid leaned against his workbench. \"What's their pitch?\"\n\n\"The standard existential threat argument—orcs breed exponentially, if they conquer Violet they'll need more territory, humanity must unite before it's too late, et cetera.\" Lauel's tone made his skepticism clear. \"They're also pointing to the growing number of players converting to the orc race as proof of escalating danger.\"\n\n\"Not entirely wrong,\" Grid conceded. \"But if the orcs were truly an existential threat to all humanity, why did Basara liberate them in the first place? The Empire understands the orc species better than anyone. They wouldn't have freed a civilization-ending menace just to prove a political point about unity.\"\n\nFor a moment, Lauel simply stared at his king. Then his face split into a genuine grin.\n\n\"You washed the lettuce today, didn't you?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Nothing. You're absolutely correct—the Empire's decision to liberate the orcs is the logical flaw in Violet's entire argument. The other kingdoms see it too. The alliance proposal is dead in the water.\"\n\n\"But individual kingdoms will send mercenary forces in exchange for payment,\" Grid finished.\n\n\"Which brings me to you.\" Lauel shuffled his papers. \"The Violet Kingdom is cornered. When their alliance collapses, they'll have to hire reinforcements at whatever price the market demands. This is an opportunity.\"\n\n\"Then I have bad news—I'm refusing the contract.\"\n\nLauel's expression didn't change. \"Explain.\"\n\n\"Baron Biz.\" Grid's voice hardened. \"The bastard who insulted us at our own founding ceremony. Asmophel killed him, and instead of apologizing for sending an envoy who threatened violence in our hall, Violet demanded *we* pay reparations. Then there's Agnus. Euphemina proved his innocence months ago, provided evidence, requested his release—they ignored her completely. These aren't people I'm interested in helping.\"\n\n\"So this is retaliation.\"\n\n\"Partially.\" Grid folded his arms. \"But there's a more practical angle. Every kingdom that sends troops to Violet will suffer casualties fighting the twilight orcs and their player conscripts. Heavy casualties. Their military capacity will be degraded for months, maybe years. Meanwhile, we'll be at full strength.\"\n\nHe met Lauel's gaze directly.\n\n\"Our population is growing. We need more territory to accommodate them. Letting our rivals exhaust themselves seems like excellent timing.\"\n\nLauel's grin returned, sharper this time. \"Now that's the reasoning I wanted to hear.\"\n\nConquest had always been part of the plan. Lauel had worried Grid might harbor naive objections to aggressive expansion, but apparently those concerns were unfounded. Grid understood that the Empire was too massive to absorb, but expanding the Overgeared Kingdom to a sustainable size? That aligned perfectly with everyone's ambitions.\n\n\"Are you finally making something new?\" Lauel nodded toward the anvil, where a rough sword-shaped mass of Greed sat waiting.\n\n\"Need to walk the flower path properly equipped.\" Grid picked up the material, feeling its weight. \"This should do it.\"\n\n\"I'd love to watch you work, you know.\" The words came out more sincere than Lauel had intended. \"There's something about seeing you at the forge. The focus. The way you pour everything into each strike. People who've only seen you fight think they know you—but people who've watched you craft? They understand what makes you dangerous.\"\n\nGrid softened slightly. \"You're too busy for that. I'll send you the item specs when I'm finished.\"\n\n\"Then I'll wait eagerly for us to roam the galaxy together until fate decides our end. Kukukuk.\"\n\n\"...Get out.\"\n\nLauel left whistling, his mind already churning through possibilities. Greed was powerful enough that some drawback had to exist—that was basic game balance. But what would Grid create with it?\n\n*It'll be impressive,* Lauel thought as he walked back toward the palace. *But surely nothing can truly replace Braham's Boots. Fly is just too versatile.*\n\nThree days later, buried in his morning paperwork, Lauel learned how wrong he'd been.\n\n—*It's finished.*\n\nGrid's whisper carried exhaustion but satisfaction.\n\n[Player 'Grid' wishes to share the information of Arrogant Blue Dragon's Boots.]\n\nLauel accepted the share request.\n\nHis coffee went cold in his hand.\n\n**[Arrogant Blue Dragon's Boots]**\n\n**Rating: Myth**\n\n**Durability: Infinite**\n**Defense: 1,030**\n\n* Movement speed +10%\n* Evasion +15%\n* Lightning attribute resistance +40%\n* Dark attribute resistance +40%\n* Attack speed +30% when attacking with the lower body\n* When attacking with the lower body, there is a high chance of triggering 'Crush'\n* When hit in the lower body, there is a low chance of ignoring damage\n* When hit in the lower body, there is a high chance of triggering 'Reconstruction'\n* Height +3 centimeters\n* The skill 'Come Down!' is generated\n* The passive skill 'Lightning Incarnation' is generated\n* Defense will increase by 10% in canyon terrains\n* The power of wide-area skills will increase by 20% in canyon terrain\n* Decreases the target's defense and magic resistance by 10% when encountering great demons weaker than the 22nd rank\n* If damage to the extent of destroying the boots is received, the durability is fixed for a minimum of 5 seconds. There is a 10% durability recovery after this effect is over (24 hours cooldown)\n\n★ The skill 'Lightning Speed' is generated\n★ The skill 'Lightning God' is generated\n\n**Boots made by the blacksmith Grid, who gained enlightenment when fighting against a god.**\n\n**They are long boots that rise up to the knee, but the elasticity of Greed—which was used as the material—is flexible and doesn't interfere with movements at all.**\n\n**The guard is made from Strengthened Astaroth's Horn while the soles are made from Strengthened Astaroth's Bone, adding a higher defense and a handsome appearance. The magnetic force generated from the guard and the soles creates a repulsion against metal. Ordinary weapons can't reach these boots.**\n\n**The Strengthened Blue Dragon's Breath further enhances the lightning properties of Astaroth's horns and bones. In the process of Greed completely absorbing it, some of the abilities of the blue dragon have been inadvertently implemented.**\n\n**The Strengthened Blue Dragon's Breath grants the wearer a mythical protection.**\n\n**Grid's epics are contained in it.**\n\n**Conditions of Use: Grid**\n**Weight: 600**\n\n**[Crush]**\n\n**Significantly reduces the durability of the target's armor.**\n\n**[Reconstruction]**\n\n**Restores it to its original state in case of reduced durability or damage to form.**\n\n**[Come Down! Lv. 1]**\n\n**Summons the descending blue dragon's clone.**\n\n**The thunderbolt accompanying the blue dragon's descent inflicts 30,000 fixed damage to each target at the summoner's feet and has a high chance of causing electric shock. Electrocuted targets are paralyzed for a minimum of 0.5 seconds and a maximum of 5 seconds.**\n\n* Skills attached to myth rated items can be upgraded\n\n**Mana Consumption: 2,000**\n**Cooldown Time: 12 hours**\n\n**[Lightning Incarnation Lv. 1]**\n\n**A sustainable passive.**\n\n**The blue dragon's protection will give you a body close to lightning.**\n\n**Stamina won't be consumed when flying. Magic power and skill resources consumed when flying are reduced by 20%. In cloudy or rainy weather, resource consumption is reduced by an additional 10% and in thunderstorms, an additional 20%.**\n\n**Attacks with the lightning property will usually have a beneficial effect (a small stamina recovery, a significant mana recovery or a small increase in one stat will be randomly applied. 10 seconds cooldown time).**\n\n**Your attacks have a chance to burn the target's mana (5% of the target's total mana).**\n\n* Skills attached to myth rated items can be upgraded\n\n**[Lightning Speed Lv. 1]**\n\n**Your body is covered with the energy of a blue dragon.**\n\n**During the flight state, you will breathe at altitudes high enough to reach a new world.**\n\n* Movement speed increased by 20%\n* The maximum speed limit can be exceeded\n* Full immunity to lightning-based attacks\n\n**Mana Cost: 3,000 per second**\n**Cooldown Time: 3 seconds**\n\n* Skills attached to myth rated items can be upgraded\n\n**[Lightning God Lv. 1]**\n\n**A conditional passive.**\n\n**Assimilate with the breath of the blue dragon.**\n\n**Once you reach the maximum speed, there is a low chance that your body will turn into lightning. At this point, all attacks are converted to lightning. Every time you hit the target, a lot of mana is burned (10% of the total mana).**\n\n**You are immune to all physical attacks, but you will take twice the damage from magic attacks without any defense or resistance. It also leaves a current that deals 10 times the damage in your movement path. The duration of the electric current is 2 seconds.**\n\n**It won't be released until the speed drops and will be released immediately once you deviate from the maximum speed.**\n\n* If you die in the Lightning God then the wrath of the blue dragon will occur\n* Skills attached to myth rated items can be upgraded\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nThe boots themselves were stunning—black leather rising to the knee, traced with golden filigree that caught light like captured lightning. Greed's flexibility meant zero movement restriction despite the coverage. The aesthetic alone transcended personal taste; anyone with eyes would recognize them as masterwork.\n\nBut the performance.\n\nFootwear typically offered minimal defensive value compared to chest pieces or helms. These boots matched legendary-grade armor. Infinite durability was already noteworthy. But ten major enchantments, each powerful enough to define an epic-rated item on its own? The combination of Greed, Blue Dragon's Breath, great demon byproducts, and Grid's accumulated achievements had produced something beyond Lauel's considerable imagination.\n\n—*Congratulations. Seriously.* He paused. *By the way... how many more are you planning to make?*\n\n—*How many? At least a thousand.*\n\n—*Do you know what the word 'conscience' means?*\n\n—*I'm not trying to harm anyone.*\n\nGrid's vision was simple: a Greed Army. The fact that only he could use pavranium-infused Greed wasn't actually a limitation—he could remove those unique properties using the insane dragon hammer and anvil. The performance would decrease significantly, but the base material would still be harder than adamantium. He could theoretically equip every Overgeared member with Greed equipment tailored to their specifications.\n\n*When the time is right,* Grid thought, already planning the production schedule. *The different species episode will shake the whole continent. But we'll be ready.*\n\n—*The Lightning God skill is a bit risky—you could turn into an accidental troll if your luck stat betrays you at the wrong moment. But honestly? I don't think it'll be a problem unless things go catastrophically wrong.* A pause. *These are magnificent. Congratulations again.*\n\nThe whisper ended.\n\nLauel leaned back in his chair, staring at nothing.\n\nIn his mind, he was already recalculating every strategic projection for the next five years."
