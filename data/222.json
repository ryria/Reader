Water channels discovered by Piaro fed the parched earth while Grid's farming equipment enriched the soil. Golden stalks of wheat swayed where dust devils once danced.\n\nThe financial hemorrhage had slowed to a trickle. No more importing food at extortionate prices. Vegetation crept across the desert's edge. The yellow dust weakened. Children who'd been coughing blood now ran through the streets.\n\nAn old woman knelt in the dirt, tears streaming down her weathered face. \"Duke Grid saved us.\"\n\nThe man beside her nodded, throat tight with emotion. \"We would have died without him.\"\n\nFor ten years, starvation had stalked Reidan. Grid and the Overgeared members were angels descended from Goddess Rebecca herself. The people worked with fervent devotion, learning trades as farmers, blacksmiths, architects, soldiers. They rebuilt their home with bleeding hands and grateful hearts.\n\nReidan pulsed with new life.\n\n***\n\nHuroi knocked on the smithy door. \"Have you been out on the streets lately?\" He stepped inside, grinning. \"Voices praising you are everywhere.\"\n\nGrid didn't look up from the sword he was tempering. \"Really? I've been too busy to go outside.\"\n\n*Too busy losing money.*\n\nOnce, Huroi had served Grid out of obligation—a favor repaid. Now he watched Grid mature into a true leader. His loyalty had transformed into genuine respect.\n\n\"I'm proud of you.\" Huroi clasped Grid's shoulder.\n\nThe ghost town teetering on oblivion's edge now thrived. Overgeared members kept monsters at bay. Jude trained a small but deadly army. Khan nurtured young blacksmiths. Rabbit's administrative genius accelerated development. Euphemina duplicated critical skills—monster taming, blacksmithing, architecture—proving invaluable across multiple fields.\n\nJishuka ruled Bairan with an iron fist. She and two other Overgeared members drilled the knights and soldiers relentlessly, hunted frostlight orcs, and raided the Guardian of the Forest. The guild warehouse overflowed with minerals and sylphid scales. Soon every member would possess an invisibility cloak.\n\nGrid had assembled this coalition of talent and ego. Huroi's respect deepened daily.\n\nGrid wiped sweat from his brow. \"There's still a long way to go.\"\n\nSatisfaction eluded him. Reidan remained in the red.\n\n*We only have a smithy, barracks, and alchemy institute as facilities.*\n\nPopulation growth stagnated. Taxes couldn't be raised. Five items crafted daily, yet no profit materialized. Grid's mood soured. What if he'd sold those 450 items over three months to users instead of investing them in Reidan?\n\n*I would've earned at least 1.5 billion won, even after taxes and materials cost.*\n\nNot one legendary rating among 450 items. Two uniques, yes—but he'd fed them to the city's infrastructure instead of his bank account.\n\nLauel appeared in the doorway. \"Don't dwell on immediate damages.\" He crossed the smithy floor. \"The items you made increased efficiency across every work field. Several times over. That investment will return bigger profits.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n***\n\nNoon arrived. Grid ate lunch at the smithy, discussing logistics with Huroi and Lauel between bites. Khan remained absorbed in teaching the young blacksmiths, hammer strikes punctuating his lessons.\n\nLauel clicked his tongue. \"Khan grows stronger every day.\" He studied the old man's steady movements. \"His increased health makes me wonder if Reidan's desert sand really does improve longevity.\"\n\n\"That old man is just built different.\" Grid bit into a rainbow potato. \"Which reminds me—has there been a steady increase in sales for the Longevity Remedy?\"\n\n\"This month's sales reached 1,230 gold.\"\n\n\"Still not even a quarter of Rabbit's salary.\"\n\nRabbit collected 500 gold as a viscount, then another 5,300 gold as administrator. The 'minimum' value Rabbit himself had set. Pledge loyalty all he wanted—the man wouldn't lift a finger for less than 5,300 gold monthly. Reidan's deficit had a name, and it was Rabbit.\n\n\"But we shouldn't begrudge him.\" Lauel leaned against the furnace. \"Sir Rabbit's value can't be converted to money.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nRabbit accelerated Reidan's growth beyond any normal administrator. Domestic affairs improved at a rate other cities could only dream of. A named NPC with an **S-grade administrative skill** was worth every copper.\n\n*Don't fret. Look to the future.*\n\nAfter Reidan developed, the giant worms would be exterminated. The western territories would be reclaimed. He'd use that foundation to build a kingdom. One of his immediate goals.\n\n*Then I'll make money.*\n\nGrid would become a tycoon. Never again would poverty chain him.\n\n**Ttang! Ttang!**\n\nThe hammer sang against steel. Grid ate the rainbow potato—the first crop harvested in three months. His level remained stuck at 275 due to lack of hunting, but anxiety didn't touch him. His stats increased with every epic-rated item or higher.\n\nGrid was a blacksmith. He could level his stats even while working in the smithy.\n\n***\n\nThe Butin Barony occupied the eastern edge of the Saharan Empire. A rural backwater boasting only ocean views. Peaceful to the point of boredom—monsters didn't spawn here. Users rarely visited.\n\nYet Muto, the 3rd ranked merchant, operated a small company fiercely focused on Butin trade. The barony might lack users, but it served as a resort for wealthy NPCs and nobles.\n\n\"The Longevity Remedy?\"\n\nMuto specialized in supplying luxury goods to the rich who vacationed in Butin. His sales had dropped suddenly. After investigation, he'd identified the culprit. He held up a glass bottle containing sand and frowned.\n\n\"This sand sells as a luxury product? The Longevity Remedy?\" He turned the bottle, studying it. \"My sales are falling because of this?\"\n\nMuto had examined countless items. As a merchant, his insight was exceptional. The Longevity Remedy was simple sand.\n\n\"It's brilliant.\"\n\nWhich merchant had conceived marketing Reidan's sand as the Longevity Remedy? Muto's amazement grew as Butin NPCs praised the product's effects.\n\n\"This level of business acumen borders on genius scamming.\"\n\nA tremendous merchant must be hiding in Reidan. Muto was certain. He worried about competing with such cunning, then inspiration struck.\n\n\"Isn't there a huge desert surrounding Reidan?\"\n\nHis smile widened. Muto immediately led his company toward Reidan. Difficulties surfaced the moment they crossed the border.\n\n\"What the hell is this?\"\n\nThe Muto Company guards exceeded level 200. Expensive mercenaries who'd perfectly protected the company from monsters and bandits. The instant they entered Reidan territory, giant worms, desert toads, and other monstrosities devoured them.\n\n\"This is insane!\"\n\nWhy were the monsters so strong? Twin ogres had been the most powerful creatures he'd encountered previously, and they were nothing compared to these western horrors.\n\n\"Run!\"\n\nThe Muto Company fled the nightmare. Muto still managed to stuff desert sand into his bag during the retreat.\n\n\"Gods!\" He collapsed at Butin's border, gasping. \"Almost died!\"\n\nHalf his guards lay dead in that cursed desert. Muto trembled.\n\n\"I have to sell all the sand to recoup losses.\"\n\nMuto sought out a merchant NPC, presenting the Longevity Remedy he'd crafted from Reidan's sands. The NPC's face twisted with disgust.\n\n\"The Longevity Remedy is made from sand collected in central Reidan, not ordinary desert sand.\" The merchant crossed his arms. \"We only acknowledge the sand from Reidan's lord as genuine Longevity Remedy. Everything else is worthless garbage. I'm terminating our business relationship. I don't work with crooks.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nDisaster. He'd thought it would be easy. His opponent had already fortified their market position. Muto had lost guards and clients chasing sand.\n\n***\n\nShin Youngwoo logged out of Satisfy. Dinner time. He found his parents in the living room peeling garlic and sat beside them.\n\n\"I'll help.\"\n\nHis parents ran a vegetable store. Garlic was a staple commodity requiring daily preparation. In the past, he'd never offered assistance. Now he was different.\n\nHe'd matured. Wanted to help. But his parents refused.\n\n\"Youngwoo, aren't you exhausted from the game?\" His mother looked up. \"You should rest.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" His father nodded. \"This is our job. Go eat and focus on the game.\"\n\nThey'd dismissed gaming in the past. Now they recognized it as his workplace. Gratitude warmed Youngwoo's chest. He sat with a bright smile.\n\n\"I want to help.\"\n\nPeeling garlic required experience. The surface was hard, the skin paper-thin. Specific tricks were needed to remove skin stuck to the flesh. Youngwoo had lacked dexterity since childhood. Until joining the army, he couldn't tie his shoelaces properly. Normally, peeling one garlic clove consumed several minutes. He wouldn't be much help.\n\nHis parents knew this. But they didn't stop him—their son wanted to contribute.\n\nTime passed.\n\n\"Oh my.\" His mother stared. \"Youngwoo, when did your dexterity become so good?\"\n\nYoungwoo's hands moved with professional precision, skin peeling away cleanly. His speed matched his parents', who'd run the vegetable store for decades. His father gaped.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\nYoungwoo was more shocked than his parents.\n\n*Unbelievable. Why is it so much easier to peel garlic?*\n\nHis dexterity had increased dramatically. What was the reason? Youngwoo pondered while peeling. The answer arrived within minutes.\n\n*It's the result of repetitive actions!*\n\nDelicate hands were required to craft items. Since becoming Pagma's Descendant, Youngwoo had made thousands of items. His dexterity in reality had increased through muscle memory and experience.\n\n*I've seen this in the news before.*\n\nUsers who repeatedly practiced swordsmanship in Satisfy saw their real-world skills improve. The inevitable result of repetitive practice. Physical ability in reality was significantly lower than in Satisfy—impossible to implement all techniques. But following some techniques wasn't difficult.\n\nThe same principle applied to Youngwoo's dexterity.\n\nA laugh bubbled up. \"Huhuhu...\"\n\nSatisfaction flooded through him. If he ever obtained a lover in reality, he'd be able to make her happy with his dexterity. The legendary hand technique that brought ecstasy to women in Satisfy had manifested in the real world.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**\n**OG:** Glossary Link.\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
