Group itself, late nights had become routine. With over two billion users logged in at any given moment, the game's flow was a living thing—unpredictable, sprawling, impossible to fully control. Every action, every decision made by those two billion people created ripples. Variables. Errors waiting to happen.\n\nHis fingers returned to the keyboard. *Can't allow even a single error.*\n\nWhen Lim Cheolho worked, the world narrowed to code and data streams. The phone beside him had been ringing for forty seconds before he registered the sound. He snatched it up.\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\nThe operations team leader's voice was tight. \"Quest B408 has been triggered. I need authorization to convene an emergency meeting.\"\n\nLim Cheolho's mind immediately catalogued the relevant data. B408. A codename for a specific category of S-grade hidden quests, each requiring extreme conditions to activate.\n\n*The compensation for Quest B408 is a second class.* \n\nThe implication settled over him like cold water. Whoever cleared this quest would become Satisfy's first dual-class user. But there was no reward without proportional risk. B408's difficulty wasn't just in-game. The quest demanded the user remain trapped in an enclosed virtual space for two hundred hours of game time—fifty hours in reality. Fifty hours without logging out, without rest, locked in a capsule. The psychological strain could be catastrophic.\n\nThat clause buried in the user agreement—the one granting S.A. Group access to personal information under specific circumstances—existed precisely for quests like this.\n\n\"I give permission.\" Lim Cheolho was already standing, shutting down his workstation. \"I'll attend personally.\"\n\n---\n\nThe conference room's overhead lights flickered on as he entered. A dossier waited at his seat. He flipped it open, scanning the contents.\n\n\"Mongolian.\" His eyebrows rose. \"Interesting.\"\n\nMongolia. A nation rich in untapped resources but historically poor in the infrastructure to exploit them. The post-communist era had brought a flood of foreign investment, with Korea among the eager participants. *Land of opportunity*, they'd called it in the 2020s. But political instability in the 2010s had choked that flow to a trickle. Burned investors didn't return easily.\n\nOnly in the 2040s, riding the wave of global technological advancement, had Mongolia finally stabilized enough to join the developed world. Yet even prosperity hadn't changed the Mongolian soul. The vast majority of its people still preferred open grasslands to office buildings, horses to capsules.\n\nAccording to the latest statistics, over sixty percent of developed nations' populations played Satisfy. Mongolia? Three percent. For a people whose ancestors had conquered half the world on horseback, the idea of being sealed in a coffin-sized capsule was anathema.\n\n*Three percent is honestly a miracle.*\n\nLim Cheolho studied the user profile. Allunbatar—a name that would trip up most Korean tongues. Twenty-five years old. Level 127. Class: Orator.\n\nHe blinked. An Orator at level 127 was remarkable in itself; the class had virtually no combat ability. But a *Mongolian* Orator reaching that level?\n\n*Quest-based leveling.* Lim Cheolho nodded to himself. *By utilizing the Orator's characteristics, he'd be able to obtain relatively difficult quests through persuasion. Effective, if you can stomach the role-play.*\n\nThe conference room door burst open. Executives streamed in, several clearly roused from sleep. One reeked of soju. Lim Cheolho's gaze settled on Director Yoon Sangmin, whose normally immaculate appearance had been replaced by disheveled hair and a wrinkled collar.\n\nLim Cheolho allowed himself a small smile. \"I thought you'd comb your hair even during an apocalypse, Director Yoon. Is your weakness... sleep?\"\n\nThe other board members erupted into laughter.\n\n\"We finally found it! Director Yoon's weakness!\"\n\n\"I was starting to think you might be a robot that didn't bleed. Good to know you're human.\"\n\nThe laughter cut through the tension. Even the executives who'd been swaying on their feet seemed to sharpen, their eyes clearing.\n\nYoon Sangmin's face flushed red. He smoothed his hair with jerky movements, then gestured sharply at Yoon Nahee. \"Since all executives are present, I assume the Mongolian branch is ready for connection?\"\n\n\"Connecting now.\" Yoon Nahee tapped her tablet.\n\nA three-dimensional hologram materialized above the center of the roundtable. Branch Manager Park Eunhyuk and his team appeared, their images crisp despite the distance. They bowed toward Lim Cheolho.\n\nLim Cheolho steered the meeting forward. \"Our agenda: securing the safety of the Mongolian user Allunbatar, who has triggered Quest B408. Branch Manager Park, you have the floor.\"\n\nPark Eunhyuk straightened. His efficiency was evident in the crispness of his report. \"We've tracked Allunbatar's IP address and confirmed his physical location matches our member database. If complications arise, we have an arrangement with the Mongolian government for immediate dispatch of medical personnel and law enforcement. Our security team is monitoring his vital signs in real time.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Lim Cheolho nodded. \"Continue.\"\n\nPark Eunhyuk's expression shifted—calculation replacing mere competence. \"The Mongolian branch views this as an opportunity. With your permission, we'd like to leak controlled information to the media. The first user with two classes in Satisfy—and a Mongolian user at that—this will generate global coverage. Natural PR. Once Mongolians see one of their own becoming a worldwide celebrity through Satisfy, interest in the game will spike.\"\n\n\"Clever.\" One of the executives leaned forward. \"Interest drives experimentation. User numbers go up.\"\n\nAnother chimed in, \"Every major media outlet will jump on this story. If we frame Allunbatar as a national hero, Mongolian pride will amplify the effect exponentially.\"\n\nMost heads around the table were nodding. But not all.\n\n\"What if he fails?\" The objection came from the back. \"We build global attention, the quest falls apart, and we're left with egg on our faces.\"\n\nYoon Sangmin—hair now properly combed—shook his head. \"Success or failure, Allunbatar becomes the first confirmed S-grade hidden quest recipient. That alone makes him notable. Naturally, success would be preferable.\" He turned toward Yoon Nahee. \"Team Leader Yoon, what's your analysis on the probability of success?\"\n\n\"We've completed the assessment.\" Yoon Nahee gestured, and her team members distributed fresh documents around the table. The Mongolian branch received theirs via email.\n\nSilence fell as the executives read.\n\nThen: \"What the hell is this?\"\n\n\"Nine percent?\" Yoon Sangmin's voice cracked. \"W-What?\"\n\nHe scanned the page again, as if the numbers might rearrange themselves. \"Quest B408 involves rescue by a hidden NPC. Allunbatur's health metrics are excellent. We can prevent logout by monitoring him externally. If he doesn't log out, the NPC rescues him and he clears the quest. This should be at least eighty percent!\"\n\n\"Well...\" Yoon Nahee began.\n\n\"Kuhahahahaha!\"\n\nEvery head swiveled toward Lim Cheolho. The chairman was laughing—actually laughing, his shoulders shaking. The executives stared at him in collective shock.\n\nLim Cheolho clicked his tongue. \"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Your nature is too impatient, Sangmin. You should read documents before asking questions.\"\n\nSilence. The executives returned to the papers, reading more carefully this time.\n\nYoon Sangmin crumpled his copy in one fist. His voice was barely a whisper. \"Again... that person...\"\n\n---\n\nThe intended scenario for Quest B408 followed a clear progression:\n\nA user with high reputation would build maximum affinity with Winston's residents. During this process, they'd learn about the wickedness of both Winston's corrupt lord and the exploitative Mero Company. Gradually, the user would become emotionally invested—genuinely resenting the injustice on behalf of the NPCs. The residents, recognizing this sincerity, would offer a quest: *For the Residents of Winston*.\n\nUpon acceptance, the real test would begin. The user would attempt to reach Earl Steim to report the corruption. But Winston's lord and the Mero Company controlled too much. The user would be caught. Imprisoned in the dungeon.\n\nAt that point, the quest would transform: *For the Residents of Winston* became *Wait*. If the user accepted and endured two hundred hours without logging out, a hidden NPC—the Mysterious Apostle of Justice—would appear to rescue them due to special circumstances that placed this NPC in Winston at that exact time.\n\nFrom there, the user would learn the Apostle's identity and embark on a chain of linked quests, eventually earning rewards beyond imagination.\n\nBut the scenario had derailed. A variable had emerged.\n\nAllunbatar had shared the quest information with another user. The moment he'd done that, the carefully scripted appearance of the Mysterious Apostle of Justice became obsolete. The related quest chain vanished. Instead, news of Allunbatar's imprisonment would reach the user he'd contacted—the one he'd told about Winston's corruption.\n\nAnd that user was...\n\n\"Grid.\"\n\nTwelve days ago, a Korean named Shin Youngwoo had stumbled into a legendary class through sheer chance.\n\nAnd now, the fate of Mongolia's first potential dual-class user rested in his hands.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms**  \n**OG:** [Glossary Link]  \n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\n*Check out my Patreon for early access to unedited chapters and to help achieve goals for extra chapters.
