  "content": "**Chapter: The Price of Alliance**\n\nA whisper arrived, casual as a weather report.\n\n*—Finished cleaning up the 1st Battalion.*\n\nGrid stared at the message, sweat beading on his forehead despite the cool dungeon air. Euphemina made it sound like she'd just tidied a bedroom, not massacred two thousand elite soldiers.\n\nHis fingers hovered over the reply function. Every word had to be perfect. One wrong syllable and she might... He didn't want to think about what she might do.\n\n*—Are you okay? Was it difficult? I hope the assignment wasn't too troublesome. I was worried.*\n\nThe message went through. Grid exhaled, shoulders sagging with relief. Perfect. Polite, concerned, appropriately respectful—\n\nHe loved all his guild members, truly. But Euphemina occupied a special category in his heart: the category reserved for natural disasters and apex predators. Every interaction with her felt like defusing a bomb while reading a foreign language dictionary.\n\nEuphemina, for her part, simply believed Grid was exceptionally kind to her. The thought warmed her considerably.\n\n*—Bothersome? I'm honored to contribute to the Overgeared Kingdom. Please rely on me more in the future.*\n\n*—Of course! Thank you. Really. Ha... ha...*\n\n*—But...*\n\nGrid's breath caught. *—Yes?*\n\n*—I think we need to discuss Ares' capabilities. His power is genuinely frightening.*\n\nThe levity drained from her message. Grid straightened, sensing the shift in tone.\n\n*—The armored elite troops survived four consecutive S-grade spells. Ares granted them magic resistance and enhanced vitality as inherent attributes. If they'd had even one or two healers with them...*\n\n*—Attribute bestowal,* Grid typed slowly, his mind racing.\n\nThe intelligence gathered during this campaign was invaluable. Ares had personally trained these soldiers, imbuing them with skills and attributes that rivaled named monsters. The implications were staggering—if Ares could forcibly elevate soldiers' capabilities and grant them permanent enhancements...\n\n*That's basically a cheat skill,* Grid thought darkly.\n\nThe restrictions had to be significant. They had to be. But even accounting for limitations, the threat was undeniable. With time, the Ares Army could match even the Saharan Empire's military might. Once Belto Kingdom fell, Ares would command vast territories, enormous populations, and the tax base to fuel an unstoppable war machine.\n\n*—These troops belonged to the Belto royal family,* Euphemina continued. *—They weren't even Ares' direct soldiers. His personal forces—the units he's raised from scratch—must be exponentially stronger. We defeated these because of overwhelming offense, but if they'd been better supported...*\n\nShe was right. Grid and Euphemina had relied on legendary weapons and continuous high-tier skills to punch through the elite troops' defenses before they could coordinate. Against more developed forces, even they might struggle.\n\n*—We shouldn't maintain this alliance long-term,* Euphemina concluded. *—If we lean on Ares out of fear of the Empire, we'll be devoured by him instead.*\n\n*—I know.*\n\n*—Then what do we do? We need him to survive the Empire.*\n\n*—We do. For now.*\n\nGrid composed his next message carefully, projecting the confidence a king should have—even if he didn't entirely feel it.\n\n*—Don't forget our own potential while you're worrying about theirs. I'm the Overgeared King. My soldiers wear my equipment. Our growth potential is just as extraordinary as Ares'.*\n\nThe words felt right as he typed them. The anxiety loosened its grip on his chest.\n\n*—Our army can match his. No—we can surpass him. So don't fear Ares. Fear makes us vulnerable.*\n\n*—...You're right. I was being shortsighted.*\n\nRelief flooded Euphemina's reply. Though Grid didn't realize it, she leaned on him more than anyone else in the guild—not for his strength alone, but for the certainty he provided when doubt crept in.\n\n***\n\n\"The Overgeared Guild?\" Ares leaned back in his command chair, fingers steepled. \"Impressive.\"\n\nWord had arrived of Jishuka's annihilation of the 6th Battalion. Four battalions eliminated in two days. Ares' expression remained placid, analytical.\n\n*Expected outcome, given the circumstances.*\n\nAn army's true strength emerged only under competent leadership. The battalion commanders had been adequate soldiers but poor strategists, unable to leverage the elite troops' full capabilities. They'd fought the Overgeared members head-on—played directly into their strengths.\n\n*The commander determines an army's value far more than individual soldier quality.*\n\nThis principle guided all his recruitment. Ares didn't simply gather the highest-ranked players in each class. He sought members with tactical acumen, those who could command units and synergize with his attribute-bestowal skills. Combat power meant nothing without the wisdom to apply it.\n\n\"Compile combat data from all engagements with Overgeared members,\" he ordered his aide. \"I want detailed analysis of every weakness the armored elite troops displayed. The next generation will be... refined.\"\n\nHis pulse quickened. Soon, very soon, Belto Kingdom's resources would be his. The army he could forge with that foundation...\n\nThe future was intoxicating.\n\n***\n\n\"You've done remarkable work.\"\n\nScott greeted Grid at the command tent, though his eyes tracked past the legendary blacksmith to fix on Euphemina. Despite her deceptively gentle appearance, Scott's instincts screamed *danger*.\n\nGrid noticed the wariness and felt a surge of vindication. *Finally, someone who understands!*\n\n\"We'll mobilize the main force in four days,\" Scott continued. \"Can the Overgeared members maintain support through the campaign?\"\n\n\"The current detachment will remain,\" Grid replied without hesitation. \"We'll see this through to the capital.\"\n\n\"You personally will...?\" Scott blinked, genuinely surprised.\n\nThat the king of another nation would commit himself for days to their cause... The Ares Army had essentially forced this alliance after inadvertently painting themselves as traitors. Scott had every reason to resent the Overgeared Guild.\n\nYet the more he interacted with Grid, the harder resentment became to maintain.\n\n*Maybe the man has a conscience after all.*\n\n***\n\n\"WHAT?! The armored elite troops—annihilated?!\"\n\nChaos consumed the royal meeting chamber. The Belto princes spoke over each other, voices rising toward hysteria.\n\n\"But Ares was supposed to be crippled from his war with the Empire! How could he—\"\n\n\"He was holding back the entire time!\" Another prince slammed his fist on the table. \"He planned this betrayal from the beginning!\"\n\n\"Of course he has hidden strength,\" a third prince said bitterly. \"He trained those troops himself. We were fools to think we'd seen his full capabilities.\"\n\nThe color drained from their faces as the implications crystallized. Without the armored elite troops, how could they possibly withstand Ares' counteroffensive?\n\n\"It's over,\" one prince whispered. \"That snake has taken everything...\"\n\nThe king sat silent, mouth working soundlessly.\n\nHinges shrieked.\n\n\"Should I just... watch? Hmm?\"\n\nEvery head swiveled toward the chamber doors—doors that should have been barred, guarded by the kingdom's finest knights. A figure stood in the entrance: slim, pale, with eyes like molten gold that seemed to freeze the blood in their veins.\n\nMadness lived in those eyes. Violence coiled beneath porcelain skin.\n\n\"W-Who dares—\" The king's challenge died as his gaze swept past the intruder to the corridor beyond.\n\nBodies. The royal guard lay in spreading pools of crimson.\n\n\"Who... what are you?\"\n\nThe intruder's smile was a slash of white in a bloodless face. With exaggerated ceremony, he produced the imperial banner of the Saharan Empire.\n\n\"An envoy,\" Agnus said, each word dripping with mocking amusement. \"From the Empire. Mm, yes. How *rotten* this all is. Kuk—kukukuk!\"\n\nHis laughter echoed off stone walls, sharp and wrong. He dragged his tongue along his blade, savoring the blood there, before crossing the chamber in three casual strides. His hand shot out, gripping the king's jaw with crushing force.\n\n\"Lick my feet,\" Agnus whispered, breath hot against the monarch's face. \"Beg me to save you. Grovel properly, and I'll destroy Ares for you.\"\n\n\"Hik—!\" \n\nThe king's terror redoubled as two death knights materialized from the shadows, silent and implacable as gravestones. The nightmare had evolved—desperate for independence from the Empire, then humiliated by the loss of his elite troops, and now forced to prostrate himself before this *thing* wearing imperial colors.\n\n\"Kik! Kikikik—\"\n\nAgnus trembled with laughter as the King of Belto lowered himself to the floor, tongue against boot leather, shame and fear warring in his expression. \n\n*Secure the kingdom's loyalty. Neutralize the Ares threat. Stabilize the Empire's southern flank.*\n\nThose had been his orders. Agnus had forgotten them the moment blood first sprayed across palace marble. This moment—this exquisite humiliation—was reward enough.\n\nSomewhere to the north, Grid advanced with his guild, unaware.\n\nThe collision between petty malice and vindictive madness drew closer with each passing hour."
