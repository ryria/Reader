Braham's soul had seized control of his body and torn him through space itself, materializing above an ocean so vast that Grid couldn't distinguish water from sky.\n\nHe opened his status window.\n\n---\n\n**Name:** Braham Eshwald (Grid)  \n**Class:** Great Magician  \n**Title:** Possessor of Great Knowledge\n\n*The best intellectual of this time. The truth hasn't been learned yet, so he is still obstinate. This pursuit of knowledge is very strong, sometimes acting as a poison.*\n\n* Intelligence increased by 35%\n* Low probability of running wild\n\n**Title:** One who Became a Legend\n\n* High resistance to abnormal conditions\n* Death prevention when health reaches minimum\n* Easily acknowledged\n\n**Title:** ???\n\n* ???\n\n**Level:** 545  \n**Health:** 858,310/858,310 (Correction)  \n**Mana:** 13,964,000/13,965,000 (Correction)  \n**Strength:** 258 **Stamina:** 3,400  \n**Agility:** 1,009 **Intelligence:** 15,880\n\n*In this human flesh, Braham Eshwald's full strength cannot be drawn out. Most of his stats are sealed.*\n\n---\n\nGrid's mind reeled. Ten stat points per level. Level 545. That meant Braham's base stats alone exceeded **20,000** points. The number defied logic. Even accounting for titles, equipment, and quests, Braham's raw power belonged to something beyond mortal comprehension.\n\n*I have over 14,000 total stats, but most of that comes from variety.* Grid's thoughts raced. *My combat stats are only around 6,000. That's already absurd, but compared to this...*\n\nHis eyes caught on a single phrase: *Most of his stats are sealed.*\n\nIf this was Braham at a fraction of his strength, what had he been at full power? Grid glanced at the health and mana values. Those numbers suggested Braham's true strength and stamina were ten times what the status window displayed.\n\nBut one line gnawed at him more than the rest.\n\n*In this human flesh, Braham Eshwald's full strength cannot be drawn out.*\n\n\"Are you even human?\" Grid heard himself ask. His lips moved without his command.\n\n[My appearance is no different from humans, and I have a finite life.]\n\n*That's not an answer.* Grid's frustration spiked. Braham had spoken like a politician dodging a scandal.\n\n\"Where are we?\"\n\nThe horizon blurred. Sea and sky merged into a single canvas of blue that made Grid's stomach churn. He couldn't tell if his feet touched water or air, couldn't orient up from down. The weight of infinite space pressed against his skull.\n\nBraham laughed. The sound echoed inside Grid's head.\n\n[A legend feels awe at something like this?]\n\n\"Nature dwarfs us all.\" Grid's jaw tightened. \"It's just reality.\"\n\n[A legend is transcendent.] Braham's voice carried the weight of absolute certainty. [You shouldn't think of yourself as a simple person. It is no different from building a cage around your own potential.]\n\nThe words resonated deeper than they should have. Grid's suspicions toward Braham had always been sharp. Pagma died 100 years ago according to records. Braham claimed it happened 300 years ago. The math didn't work. The timeline made Braham a liar.\n\nBut now, with Braham's soul wound through his own, Grid's wariness dulled. The distrust evaporated like morning fog.\n\n*Is this his influence? Or am I just being manipulated?*\n\n[You should only beware those who can threaten you.] Braham continued. [Feel contempt toward the rest. That is the attitude of a legend.]\n\n\"Then what about you?\" Grid tested the waters. His mouth curved into a smile that wasn't his own. \"Do you fear anything?\"\n\n[I am beyond the boundaries of fear.]\n\n\"Right.\" Grid exhaled. \"Of course you are.\"\n\nHe remembered their first meeting eighteen months ago. Braham's pride had filled the room like smoke. The magician walked through the world as if it existed solely to acknowledge his greatness. What had he been like before death claimed him?\n\n\"I asked you a question. Where are we?\"\n\n[The Red Sea.]\n\nThe name struck like a hammer. The Red Sea. The largest ocean in Satisfy, an aquatic graveyard separating the East and West Continents. For thousands of years, kingdoms had thrown resources and lives at the crossing. All had failed. Only a handful of individuals had ever succeeded in reaching the opposite shore.\n\nTens of thousands had died in the attempt. Their blood allegedly turned the water crimson.\n\n[This is the center of the world.] Braham's presence swelled inside Grid's mind. [A source of infinite mana. The worst creatures dwell in these depths.]\n\n\"I don't need a geography lesson.\"\n\n[Then I'll be direct. I need something from here.]\n\nThe ocean exploded.\n\nWater surged upward in defiance of gravity. Waves formed mountains. The sky blackened in seconds, clouds boiling into existence overhead. Thunder cracked across the horizon.\n\nGrid's spine went cold.\n\n\"What the hell—\"\n\nThen he saw it. Felt it. The source of the chaos wasn't the sea or the storm.\n\nIt was Braham.\n\n---\n\n> [Braham has used Spell Drain.]\n\n> [There is no target.]\n\n> [The target isn't limited.]\n\n> [Magic power has been stolen from the atmosphere.]\n\n> [Magic power has been stolen from the sea.]\n\n> [Magic power has been stolen from the sun.]\n\n> [Your magic power has temporarily increased.]\n\n> [Your magic power has temporarily increased.]\n\n> [Your magic power has temporarily increased.]\n\n---\n\n*This is insane.*\n\nGrid knew Spell Drain. Every magician learned it early. A basic spell that siphoned a pittance of magic power from a single target. Functionally worthless against anyone competent.\n\nBraham's version shattered that definition. He'd targeted everything. The atmosphere. The ocean. The sun itself. The amplification rate climbed beyond measurement.\n\n[This is enough.]\n\nThe storm ceased. Braham's mana pool had multiplied several times over. He activated Teleport.\n\nLight swallowed Grid's vision.\n\n---\n\n## * * *\n\nThe Yatan Church's main temple never stayed in one place. Too many enemies hunted them. Secrecy demanded constant relocation. Since Satisfy launched, not a single player had found it. Even Yatan's own black magicians didn't know the temple's coordinates.\n\nUntil today.\n\n\"Finally.\" Skunk wiped sweat from his brow. \"I found it.\"\n\nThe 1st ranked explorer stood at the edge of history. His party had accomplished what armies and churches couldn't.\n\n\"Looks pretty shabby.\" One of his companions frowned at the structure. \"I thought it'd be grand like the Vatican.\"\n\n\"The Vatican's bloated.\" Another shrugged. \"This makes sense for people on the run.\"\n\nThe temple sat at the edge of the Eighth Canyon, a geological formation where steep walls curved into the shape of the number eight. The building itself looked unimpressive. A rural shrine at best. But the three pillars flanking the entrance matched every description Skunk had found in ancient texts.\n\n\"Contact every major guild and church.\" Skunk cracked his knuckles. \"We're selling this information for a fortune.\"\n\nThe Yatan Church had a long list of crimes. Half the quests in circulation involved their destruction. This location would sell itself.\n\n\"Hao's offering 1.5 million gold.\"\n\n\"That bastard's lowballing us.\"\n\n\"Giant Guild. 1.8 million.\"\n\n\"Still not enough.\"\n\n\"Violet Guild. 2.35 million gold.\"\n\nSkunk paused. \"Violet? The Dominion paladin?\"\n\nThree names dominated the paladin rankings: Damian of Rebecca, Toban of Judar, and Violet of Dominion. Violet ranked lowest of the three. But rumors claimed her combat ability exceeded both rivals. The Dominion Church specialized in war. Their paladins existed to kill.\n\n\"2.53 million gold...\" Skunk's jaw worked. \"Less than I expected.\"\n\nHis party jumped in.\n\n\"It's been over a year and a half since the war with Yatan started. Most players moved on.\"\n\n\"Dominion Church lives for battle. They'll pay.\"\n\n\"Take Violet's offer. No one else will bid higher.\"\n\nSkunk nodded slowly.\n\n\"Fine. But I have a condition.\"\n\n\"What condition?\"\n\n\"She brings reporters from at least fifteen countries.\"\n\nHis grin widened. Skunk's party had discovered the Yatan Church's main temple. He intended to broadcast that achievement to the entire world. His companions nodded agreement.\n\nThree days later, Skunk met Violet. Dozens of reporters filmed their handshake.\n\n\"Nice publicity.\" Skunk accepted the advance payment. \"You'll want them to film you destroying the temple, right? Show the world Violet ended the Yatan Church.\"\n\n\"Our guild runs an internet broadcasting station.\" Violet's expression remained flat. \"More profitable to stream through our own channels than sell footage to outsiders.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Skunk waved toward the reporters. \"Then I guess they go home alone.\"\n\nViolet paid the reporters for their time and dismissed them. She followed Skunk's directions toward the main temple.\n\n\"Follow them.\" One reporter motioned to his camera crew. \"Close.\"\n\nNone of them intended to honor their agreement. This scoop was worth risking Violet's anger. The next day, Violet's forces reached the Yatan Church's main temple hidden in the Eighth Canyon.\n\n\"This is it.\"\n\nViolet's party swallowed hard. Over ninety players stood behind her. All prepared. All equipped. But uncertainty gnawed at them.\n\nTallos. The First Servant of the Yatan Church. The continent's strongest black magician. Information about him was scarce. His abilities remained speculation.\n\nViolet raised her voice.\n\n\"Our class combination is ideal. Four of us have third advancement classes. We have the strength to kill the First Servant and destroy this temple.\"\n\nHer confidence had foundation.\n\n---\n\n> **[Kill the First Servant of Yatan]**  \n> **Difficulty:** SS+\n\n---\n\nShe'd received this quest eighteen months ago. Back then, she'd been a first advancement paladin below level 200. Now she stood at third advancement. Tallos was a named boss designed for her second advancement self. His level couldn't be that high.\n\nThat logic fueled her courage. Violet's group entered the main temple. The reporters crept behind them.\n\nThen everything fell apart.\n\n\"Look at these trivial things.\"\n\nTallos stood alone at the temple's center. A fourth advancement black magician. His presence suffocated the room. Curses spread through Violet's ranks before anyone threw an attack. His subordinates were third advancement casters. Every one of them.\n\nViolet's face twisted as magic ate through her defenses.\n\n\"This is insane!\"\n\nEighteen months of preparation. Gone. She'd spent **2.35 million gold** for information and **300,000 gold** on supplies. Her stomach cramped with rage. She wanted to split the skull of whoever designed a level 200 quest this brutal.\n\nThe reporters forgot their cover. They filmed openly now, capturing the massacre.\n\n*This is huge.* One reporter's eyes gleamed. *Four third advancement users getting crushed. The ratings will be legendary.*\n\nViolet's group descended into desperation.\n\nThen a voice cut through the chaos.\n\n\"Magic Missile.\"\n\nA basic spell. Level 10 magicians learned it in their first hour. Weak. Forgettable.\n\nIt punched through the temple wall and struck Tallos in the chest.\n\n\"Kuaaaaak!\"\n\nThe First Servant screamed. He'd ignored every attack from Violet's third advancement users without flinching. Now he staggered backward, clutching his sternum.\n\nEvery head turned.\n\nA white-haired man stood in the entrance. His expression radiated contempt.\n\n\"A fake.\" He addressed Tallos like an insect. \"Where is Amoract's soul hiding?\"\n\nThe room held its breath.\n\nSomeone identified him.\n\nShock rippled through the crowd."
