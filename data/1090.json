  "content": "**S.A. Group Headquarters – Executive Conference Room**\n\n\"Unconditional proliferation every ten days? This is completely broken!\"\n\n\"How did Morpheus even allow this? Did the system get corrupted?\"\n\n\"We're looking at a catastrophic balance failure. We need to act immediately!\"\n\nAlarm spread through the S.A. Group boardroom as the directors watched Grid forge his new mineral. Even Director Yoon Sangmin—known for his Grid-friendly stance—leaned forward with concern. \"Chairman, we need to consider an emergency patch.\"\n\nThe implications were staggering. Greed doubled in volume every ten days. In theory, the material could grow to planetary scale within a few years—rivaling the entire playable world of Satisfy. And it moved at Grid's command.\n\nOne player shouldn't hold that kind of power.\n\n\"The moment word of this gets out, our stock price will crater,\" one director insisted. \"We have to move now.\"\n\n\"Morpheus might be malfunctioning. We should run diagnostics and take the servers offline for maintenance.\"\n\nThe arguments came fast and heated. Personal feelings about Grid didn't matter—this was objective risk assessment. The proliferation effect needed restrictions. Hard limits.\n\nChairman Lim Cheolho sat in heavy silence. \n\nThe entire philosophy of Satisfy rested on player agency. Whatever direction the players took the world, S.A. Group would observe without interference. Developer intervention would shatter immersion and kill player motivation—a death spiral for any virtual world.\n\nLim Cheolho had held this position since day one. But even his resolve wavered now.\n\nFor the first time since collaborating with Morpheus and his team of scientists to birth Satisfy, uncertainty crept into his voice. Not because he doubted Grid's intentions—Grid had literally changed his life through the game, become a symbol of what Satisfy could offer. Grid would never deliberately destroy his own success.\n\nBut variables existed. What if Grid suffered an accident in the real world and couldn't log in for months? What if the calculations were flawed, and his crafting speed couldn't match Greed's exponential growth?\n\nThose scenarios kept him awake at night.\n\nThe proliferation itself was the issue. Greed's other absurd properties weren't problematic—as a Grid-exclusive item, it fit within acceptable parameters. One player dominating wasn't a threat to the world. Grid *should* lead the new era with overwhelming strength. The continent still held countless challenges: the Different Species, the Grandmaster, the yangbans, immortals, great demons, angels, and gods themselves.\n\nSatisfy's endgame had depth. Other players showed immense potential—Baal's Contractor, the Sword Saint...\n\n\"Chairman!\" The directors pressed harder. \"We need a decision. Now.\"\n\nTheir stance was reasonable. Rational. Yet Lim Cheolho hesitated.\n\nThen he asked a simple question: \"The proliferation property already existed in insane dragon iron. Grid acquired that material years ago. Has it ever caused a crisis?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nThe developers and operators didn't know every detail of Satisfy's systems. How could they? The world rivaled Earth in complexity, with countless interconnected mechanics designed by Morpheus or evolved through player actions. They tracked the critical systems, the world-shaking changes—but proliferation had never triggered an alert.\n\nIf it was truly dangerous, Morpheus would have warned them.\n\n\"The proliferation mechanic is fundamentally stable,\" Lim Cheolho concluded.\n\nBut the directors weren't convinced.\n\n\"Chairman, Greed differs from standard insane dragon iron in crucial ways. Any competent blacksmith can work with dragon iron, and its mass can be controlled with insane dragon stone. But Greed is Grid-exclusive. There's no indication he'll use dragon stone for containment, which means he alone must control the volume indefinitely.\"\n\n\"If something happens to Grid—if he can't access the game for an extended period—the consequences are terrifying.\"\n\n\"Wait.\" Another director frowned. \"If mass control is possible, then maybe proliferation isn't inherently dangerous. The dragon iron items circulating outside the Overgeared Kingdom haven't caused disasters. Perhaps the Chairman's right—proliferation has built-in safeguards.\"\n\n\"But what are those safeguards?\"\n\n\"Everyone, listen.\" Lim Cheolho held up a hand for silence. \"I hear your concerns. But Kentaro, you're missing something fundamental. Greed is Grid-exclusive. When Grid logs out, it transfers to his personal storage and becomes inert. It cannot multiply without Grid actively playing. Have you ever seen pavranium move independently during Grid's offline hours?\"\n\nThe argument faltered. They needed hard data, not speculation.\n\nLim Cheolho raised his voice. \"Morpheus—what is the probability that Grid's new mineral will destabilize Satisfy's world structure?\"\n\nThe supercomputer's response came instantly: **[Zero.]**\n\n\"...!\"\n\nEven Lim Cheolho's eyes widened. Morpheus rarely gave absolute answers. Zero percent meant complete impossibility. Total exclusion of risk.\n\nBut why?\n\n\"So proliferation *does* have a hard cap?\"\n\n**[Negative. However, if Z-003 multiplies beyond critical thresholds, its energy signature intensifies proportionally. All other Z-Objects are coded to detect and respond to this increase. Z-Objects will appear to suppress or destroy Z-003 before it reaches dangerous mass. Unless all Z-Objects are eliminated, proliferation cannot threaten system stability. The probability of total Z-Object extinction is also zero.]**\n\n\"Codename Z...? You mean *dragons*?\"\n\nChaos erupted among the directors. Some looked lost, but Lim Cheolho and most of his senior staff understood immediately.\n\n\"Of course.\" The Chairman nodded slowly. \"Proliferation derives from Insane Dragon Nevartan's power. Therefore, it attracts the hostility of dragons—beings naturally opposed to or wary of Nevartan.\"\n\n\"Whenever Greed exceeds certain size parameters, dragons will hunt Grid to reduce its mass.\"\n\n\"That explains the durability structure. Standard item degradation wouldn't apply to something dragons actively target.\"\n\n\"Wait—does this mean all the insane dragon iron items created in recent years have been destroyed by dragons? Or will be? Are we about to see dragon swarms?\"\n\n**[The Tower of Wisdom intervenes before dragon-level threats deploy. The system generates warning notifications to item owners before Tower intervention. To date, all insane dragon iron lacking proper repression properties has been recovered and disposed of by the Tower. No dragon response has been necessary.]**\n\nMost unregulated dragon iron existed in the Empire—the chandelier Grid had gifted Empress Marie, and the reinforcement stakes driven into Titan's walls. Since they were infrastructure with no registered owners, the Tower had handled them quietly.\n\n\"So it's self-regulating after all.\"\n\nRelief washed through the boardroom. The game was safe. But from Grid's perspective... he'd never be able to multiply Greed without limits. Dragon intervention guaranteed that.\n\nThe directors watched their monitors with mixed emotions—until they realized how thoroughly they'd underestimated their star player.\n\nGrid was already several steps ahead. He'd been subdividing Greed each time it doubled, creating separate items to avoid triggering the critical mass threshold.\n\nChairman Lim Cheolho smiled warmly. \"Grid understands better than any of us.\"\n\nThe dangers of proliferation. The responsibility of wielding such power. Grid knew he walked a razor's edge—that carelessness could endanger everything Satisfy represented.\n\nHe was managing himself.\n\n---\n\n**Violet Kingdom Border – Twilight Orc Territory**\n\n\"*Guruk! Gruruk!* Thank you, human! *Guruk!* You are the savior of our tribe! You have earned the right to stand among us! *Kuruk!*\"\n\n**[Hidden Quest ★Support the Twilight Orcs★ has been cleared!]**\n\n**[Affinity with the Twilight Species has increased by 20.]**\n\n**[You have gained 1 level.]**\n\n**[You may now change your race from Human to Twilight Orc.]**\n\nThe notification expanded with additional details:\n\n*[Becoming a Twilight Orc grants fluency in all orcish dialects and limited command authority over lesser orc tribes.]*\n\n*[Strength and Stamina bonuses increase Attack Power and Health by 180%. Intelligence-based Magic Attack and Mana are reduced by 50%. Depending on your Intelligence stat, you may qualify for Shaman class evolution.]*\n\n*[New class options will become available.]*\n\n*[Warning: Race changes are permanent and cannot be reversed.]*\n\n**[Do you wish to change your race?]**\n\nThe player stared at the prompt, weighing the implications.\n\nOrcs were ubiquitous across the West Continent—countless tribes ranging from primitive scavengers to sophisticated war bands. Most were low-level fodder, leading many to dismiss them as simple monsters.\n\nBut that assessment missed the truth.\n\nOrcs possessed language, tool-making capabilities, crude craftsmanship, and even necromantic traditions. They were smarter and more adaptable than dozens of other monster species. The superior tribes demonstrated shocking combat prowess—hadn't Baal's Contractor Agnus created a death knight from an orc warrior?\n\n\"One-point-eight times attack power and health?\"\n\nThe Twilight Orcs stood at the apex of orcish civilization. They combined high intelligence with physical abilities that completely eclipsed human baseline stats. They understood human speech and maintained their own blacksmith traditions.\n\nThe only drawback was weak magical aptitude. Halved magic attack and mana made skill-reliant builds nearly impossible.\n\nStill, Satisfy catered to diverse playstyles. Plenty of players preferred basic attack builds over skill rotations. Others were fascinated by shamanic paths. Some just loved the brutal aesthetics of playing a monster. And many simply craved something different—unique.\n\n\"I'll do it. I'll become an orc.\"\n\n\"Me too! I want to join!\"\n\n\"*Guruk! Gruruk!* An excellent choice.\"\n\nThe Twilight Orcs were among the original Different Species that had challenged the Saharan Empire's dominance for generations. The Empire had built massive barrier fortifications just to keep these ferocious warriors from flooding the continent. That vicious clan—responsible for slaughtering countless imperial soldiers and knights—had begun moving beyond the fallen barriers when Basara ascended the throne.\n\nOne of their primary objectives was recruitment. Absorb players. Expand influence rapidly.\n\nThey were building toward nationhood. Naturally, that required conquest.\n\nSacrifices would be made.\n\n\"*Guruk! Gruruk!* Forward! Advance! The fertile lands and warm sun don't belong to humans alone! *Guruk!* We will make them understand! *Gruruk!*\"\n\nGreen-skinned warriors surged across the Violet Kingdom's borders.\n\n---\n\n**Mountain Territory – Half-Draconian Lands**\n\n\"Reconciliation? Kukuk... why would we want that?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe single-digit Red Knights often deployed from the capital for one primary reason: confronting the half draconians. These militant hunters made their homes in the mountain ranges, living without permanent structures, dedicated entirely to the thrill of combat. They hunted monsters and beasts not for survival, but for sport.\n\nOnly a few hundred existed. Yet for the past century, the Empire had invested enormous military resources just to contain them. Fighting a single half draconian consumed more manpower than suppressing a hundred lesser tribes combined.\n\nBasara recognized the drain immediately. Upon her coronation, one of her first initiatives was dispatching an envoy to negotiate peace. She sent Marquis Borell—a diplomatic heavyweight—with generous terms. She offered the half draconians a prosperous future, even at significant cost to the Empire.\n\nThe response was... less than diplomatic.\n\n\"We fight you because it's *fun*. Why would we reconcile? Do we look stupid enough to throw away our entertainment?\"\n\n\"How *dare* you—!\"\n\nMarquis Borell was one of the Ten Great Magicians of the continent, a pillar of imperial authority alongside the five great swordsmen. As both a great magician and a marquis of the Empire's highest nobility, the half draconian's dismissive tone ignited his fury.\n\nHe wanted to incinerate the smirking bastard where he stood.\n\nBut he restrained himself. He knew Empress Basara's will. He would endure this insult for her vision.\n\nThat restraint proved fatal.\n\n\"Sir!\"\n\nControlling volatile magic power required absolute concentration. The half draconian recognized the opening instantly—and took the marquis's head in one clean strike.\n\n\"Disgraceful bastard!\"\n\n\"You killed the Marquis!\"\n\nThe escort knights drew their weapons with bloodshot eyes—then froze. Dozens of half draconians had materialized from the rocks and shadows, encircling them completely.\n\nIt was a massacre.\n\nMarquis Borell's severed head rolled across the stone as the knights fell one by one.\n\n\"Go home and deliver this message.\" The half draconian leader grinned savagely. \"Tell your Empress we're going to keep playing with you. *Kukuk! Kuhahaha!*\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe new Empire's dream of unity—of reconciliation with all peoples—would not come easily. Problems erupted from every direction, the accumulated karma of generations of rule through force and fear.\n\nBasara would learn that some debts could only be paid in blood."
