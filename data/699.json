  "content": "[You have abandoned the battlefield. Defeat acknowledged.]\n[The Undefeated King's Trial has ended in failure.]\n[All statistics return to base values. Stamina Maintenance passive destroyed.]\n[The Old Sheath's regard has diminished.]\n\n*—A disappointment. You clung to survival rather than victory. You have failed to surpass my expectations.*\n\nSilence hung heavy in the air.\n\nTwenty-two days. That's how long Oasis had to crush the Red Knights before Mercedes, the First Knight, reached the battlefield. Twenty-two days to prove himself worthy of inheriting a legend's mantle. He'd fought in isolation—the quest parameters locked everyone else out until the empire's champion arrived. Twenty-two days of despair. Twenty-two days of futility.\n\n*I can't do this.*\n\nA balance warrior to his core, Oasis distributed his points equally across stamina, strength, and agility. When the quest activated, multiplying his statistics tenfold, he'd felt invincible. Watching his attributes soar past one thousand in each category, seeing enemy after enemy crumble before his blade—for one glorious moment, he'd believed he was destined for greatness.\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nThe lower-ranked Red Knights fell easily enough. But the moment the fifteenth knight entered the fray, everything changed. His soldiers were systematically dismantled. The enemy's coordinated assault overwhelmed him completely. Every thrust of his sword met a dozen counterstrikes. His balance shattered. His attacks failed. Now he couldn't even raise his weapon.\n\n*If only I'd reached my third advancement.*\n\nThe stat awakening alone would have maximized that tenfold multiplier. Enhanced resistances, improved immunity to crowd control effects, access to advanced combat techniques—all the tools he desperately needed.\n\n*Every Red Knight has their third advancement. The Solo Number Knights have their fourth. I only had my second.*\n\nBut excuses changed nothing.\n\nHe'd failed to reach his third advancement because he lacked the skill. Even with it, the Solo Number Knights would have crushed him. That Fifth Knight especially—just remembering her abilities made his skin crawl.\n\n\"Hey! Chin up!\"\n\n*Slap!*\n\nLost in his spiraling thoughts, Oasis barely registered he was riding behind Ares until a hand clapped his back hard enough to nearly unseat him. The God of War twisted in his saddle, grinning like a madman.\n\n\"I looked into you, you know. Second advancement, right? And you still went toe-to-toe with the empire's finest? Took on an army of monsters *alone*? That's incredible. You achieved something none of us could. If that's not talent, I don't know what is.\"\n\n\"...The quest gave me power I didn't earn.\" Oasis's voice came out hollow. \"In the end, I failed. I'm not qualified to become a legend. How is that talent? I'm nobody special. Just another player.\"\n\nHis laugh was bitter, self-mocking.\n\n\"Of course I failed. How could someone like me inherit legendary power? Unless you're a prodigy like you...\" He shook his head. \"Meeting you during this quest—it's an honor. More than I deserved. I have no regrets now.\"\n\n\"You *idiot*!\"\n\n*Whack!*\n\n\"Gah!\"\n\nOasis yelped as Ares struck him again, harder this time—hard enough that with Oasis at mid-200s and his stats returned to normal, the blow genuinely threatened his health bar. Ares commanded fifty thousand troops and ranked in the top ten million globally. He could beat Oasis to death with his bare hands if he wanted.\n\nYet there was nothing but sincerity in his expression. Pure respect.\n\n\"If you weren't qualified, would you have even gotten the *chance* to become a legend? Stop selling yourself short! Haha!\"\n\n\"...I just got lucky.\"\n\n\"Luck? *Puhahat!*\" Ares threw his head back. \"Think about what you're saying! If you'd been lazy, if you'd coasted through this game like some casual tourist, would the Undefeated King have even *noticed* you?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"It's not luck—it's merit. You earned that connection. You put yourself in position to seize it.\"\n\n\"...Why?\" Oasis stared at Ares's back. \"Why do this for me? You've already helped me more than I deserve. Now you're trying to comfort me? What do you want? I have nothing to offer someone like you.\"\n\n\"Eh? Isn't it obvious?\" Ares glanced back over his shoulder. \"I like you. I came all this way to recruit you.\"\n\n\"Recruit...?\" Oasis shook his head frantically. \"You've made a mistake. I'm not the Undefeated King's successor. I was just a candidate. I *failed* the trial. Your expectations—\"\n\n\"You talk too much. We're going to Valhalla first.\" Ares's grin widened. \"I've got something special waiting—managed to create Coke in Satisfy. Only place on the continent you can get it! We'll discuss your future over a cold drink. *Hiyah!*\"\n\n\"W-Wait!\"\n\nPanic seized Oasis. Ares clearly believed he'd recruited the Undefeated King's heir. Once he learned the truth—that Oasis had failed, that the power was gone, that he was just another player—the disgust and disappointment would be crushing. Ares would discard him like trash.\n\nThe horse galloped faster. Ares leaned back slightly, voice dropping to something almost gentle.\n\n\"I'm not putting pressure on you. I don't expect anything from you. I'm simply... curious.\"\n\nThat smile again, warm and genuine.\n\n\"I want to know more about someone who stood face to face with a legend. There aren't many people in the world who can say that.\"\n\n*...One of the few great people in the world.*\n\nThe words settled into Oasis's chest like stones in still water. Something shifted.\n\nHe *had* become special. Just by reaching for something greater, he'd transcended ordinary.\n\n*Everyone struggles...*\n\nLife grinds you down with its tedious repetition. But you can't surrender hope. You have to remember—you're the protagonist of your own story.\n\nThanks to Ares, courage rekindled in Oasis's heart.\n\n***\n\n\"Ares has recruited the Undefeated King's heir.\"\n\nFaker—the Death God, the man who'd clawed his way to sun-grade despite possessing an ordinary class—delivered his report to the Master of the Overgeared Shadows.\n\n\"The Ares Army assisted someone who failed his rebellion in Lubana.\"\n\nThe timing was unfortunate. Lauel nodded slowly, absorbing the information.\n\n\"The candidate reached out to both Valhalla and us. Ares was the one who answered.\"\n\nNot ideal. If those two forged a genuine partnership, Valhalla's power could explode overnight.\n\n*If the Undefeated King's descendant joins Ares...*\n\nThe thought sent a shiver down Lauel's spine. But then he smiled.\n\n\"I don't think that's what happened.\"\n\nCertainty crystallized in his mind.\n\n\"The 'descendant' is a fraud.\"\n\nMadra earned the title \"Undefeated King\" because he *never lost*. His true heir wouldn't suffer defeat in his first major battle. Logic suggested the candidate had disqualified himself the moment he retreated—or perhaps he'd never been qualified in the first place.\n\n*Not everyone can inherit a legend's legacy. Ares, you've been deceived. You're wasting your time. Kukuk.*\n\nJoy flooded through Lauel as he confirmed his suspicions. Because if the heir was fake, that meant the position remained *open*. And Grid had found something in the Behen Archipelago. Sticks had mentioned it—a hidden treasure called the Undefeated King's Diary.\n\n*After Pagma's legacy and Braham's knowledge... now the Undefeated King's power.*\n\nPerhaps Grid would transcend legend entirely, ascending to myth. Lauel's expectations soared.\n\nBut could it really be that simple?\n\n***\n\n\"If Grid reads the entire diary, will he become the Undefeated King's successor?\"\n\nS.A. Group headquarters bustled with preparations for the third National Competition. Yoon Nahee's responsibilities hadn't changed—as Satisfy's operations manager, she monitored players of interest. Chairman Lim Cheolho shook his head at her question.\n\n\"Impossible. The Undefeated King's heir must have never experienced defeat. Not even once.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nNever lost a single battle? For a player? The requirement was absurd. Yoon Nahee exhaled in relief—she'd worried Grid might monopolize every legendary class in the game.\n\n\"However.\"\n\nLim Cheolho's smile turned enigmatic.\n\n\"That doesn't prevent him from inheriting *fragments* of the power. He qualifies for that much. Similar to how Agnus recently learned a technique from one of the Five Pillars.\"\n\n\"Agnus... Calling what he learned a 'technique' is generous. It's more like exploitation.\"\n\n\"Is that so? Hahaha!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe Five Miracle Players—individuals whose actions consistently defied Morpheus's predictions. Three of them were Kraugel, Grid, and Agnus, and Chairman Lim held particular affection for this trio. He always seemed delighted discussing them. Yoon Nahee understood why, to an extent.\n\nWatching those five players operate was genuinely entertaining, even from an outside perspective. Their unpredictability made them fascinating.\n\n***\n\n\"Sticks!\"\n\nAfter the cleansing of the Behen Archipelago, Sticks had immediately returned to his duties as principal of the Overgeared Academy, guiding students toward their potential, molding them into assets for the kingdom.\n\nNow Grid burst into his office without ceremony. \"Teach me how to convert sword energy into fighting energy!\"\n\nSticks blinked. \"I can explain, but... don't you already know?\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nWhat kind of response was that? Grid froze as Sticks studied him with growing comprehension.\n\n\"Have you not *attempted* to use your fighting energy since acquiring it?\"\n\n\"Uh? Y-Yeah... Is that a problem?\"\n\nHe'd been hunting vampires with Chris. Fighting energy never came up. Honestly, he'd assumed it was a passive resource—something that automatically enhanced his stats as it accumulated during combat. The concept of *actively using it* hadn't occurred to him.\n\n\"...Go to a hunting ground.\" Sticks pinched the bridge of his nose. \"Build up your fighting energy through combat. Then try executing one of your sword techniques.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nJudging by Sticks's expression, Grid had missed something painfully obvious. Sweat beaded on his forehead.\n\n\"Don't tell me fighting energy activates automatically once it reaches a threshold?\"\n\nNo. No way. Grid shook his head violently and sprinted toward the nearest hunting ground."
