The stadium thrummed with energy as competitors threw themselves into the boss raid and labyrinth breakthrough events.\n\nThe results surprised no one. The United States, Canada, and France swept the podium. The 2nd ranked Zibal, 3rd ranked Chris, and 8th ranked Bondre dominated their respective events.\n\nZibal anchored the American boss raid team. His perfect defense and calm leadership allowed the United States to clear faster and cleaner than any other nation.\n\nBondre tackled the labyrinth breakthrough for France. His analytical mind dissected the maze's structure faster than anyone else, securing France a gold medal.\n\nChris participated in both events. The Canadian guild master's leadership shone during the boss raid, earning his team a silver medal behind the United States. Then he turned to the labyrinth. His overwhelming combat power crushed rival rankers, netting Canada another silver behind Bondre.\n\nFinal tally: United States, one gold. France, one gold. Canada, two silvers.\n\nCanadian fans left the stadium frustrated. The three-event participation limit meant Chris had burned through two chances without securing gold. Most analysts now predicted a two-horse race between the United States and France for the overall championship.\n\nDay two shifted focus to two different countries. South Korea and Brazil. The question on everyone's lips: who were the most beautiful women in the world?\n\nAsk anyone. Two names would come up.\n\nYura and Jishuka. Billions tuned in to watch them clash in today's target processing match.\n\n\"Simple facts here. Jishuka is the expert archer. Satisfy's best. She's going to demolish the target processing.\" The first commentator leaned into his microphone.\n\n\"I'm betting on Yura.\" His colleague shook her head. \"Her magic power control is legendary. Nobody matches her casting speed and accuracy. She'll hit every target.\"\n\n\"Magic requires chanting. Arrows fly faster. Jishuka will skewer every target before Yura finishes her first spell.\"\n\n\"You're forgetting range.\" The female commentator smiled. \"Arrows pierce a few targets. Yura's magic obliterates dozens at once.\"\n\nYura had held 5th place since Satisfy launched. Jishuka started six months late but climbed to 13th on the unified rankings. In today's target processing, everyone expected them to claim gold and silver.\n\nHundreds of thousands packed the stadium. Hundreds of millions watched worldwide. The prediction seemed certain.\n\nThe expert analysts disagreed.\n\n*\"We can't overlook the other fifteen countries competing.\"*\n\n*\"Unless the other teams are braindead, they'll focus fire on Yura and Jishuka.\"*\n\n*\"Target processing isn't a solo exhibition. It's pairs. One handles targets while the other provides protection. Korea and Brazil are Satisfy minnows. They lack the firepower to defend their aces. Painful truth, but Yura and Jishuka will get eliminated early.\"*\n\nThe rules were straightforward. S.A. Group designated nine uninhabited islands for the National Competition. Two representatives from each country would spawn on an island called Tira. Each rep had to destroy small targets, five centimeters in diameter, moving at forty meters per second. Destroying targets earned points. Players could attack each other and force logouts.\n\nOne target equaled one point. No bonus points for eliminating opponents. First team to 150 points won.\n\n*\"Before we begin, let's examine Tira's geography. The island spans 67.21 square kilometers, slightly smaller than Ulleungdo. Two mountains dominate the center, rising 589 meters. Dense forest covers most terrain. Monster spawn zones and sheer cliffs pose environmental hazards.\"*\n\n*\"Are the targets concentrated anywhere specific?\"*\n\n*\"No. Fifteen hundred targets distributed evenly across the island, constantly moving. Small, fast, with varied movement patterns. Extremely difficult to hit while defending against hostile players.\"*\n\n*\"The targets come in different colors. Same point value regardless?\"*\n\n*\"Correct, with one exception. The gold target. Destroying it awards fifty points instead of one. That makes it the crown jewel of this competition. Catch is, it moves ten times faster than normal targets. Hitting it will be nearly impossible.\"*\n\n*\"Ten times faster puts it at 400 meters per second? That's pistol bullet velocity. How can anyone destroy that? The targets have 100% status resistance. No slowing them with magic.\"*\n\n*\"Smaller than a human, faster than bullets. Impossible in reality. But Satisfy breaks reality's rules. Maybe Jishuka can nail the gold target easily?\"*\n\n*\"Speaking of which, the players are entering now.\"*\n\nSeoul Olympic Stadium erupted as 33 competitors walked toward the capsule room at the stadium's heart.\n\nThirty-three. Not thirty-four.\n\nEvery country fielded two representatives. Except South Korea. Only Yura walked alone.\n\nThe crowd caught on.\n\n\"What? Where's Yura's partner?\"\n\n\"She's going solo? That's suicide.\"\n\n\"South Korea, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"They're throwing Goddess Yura to the wolves! Someone fix this!\"\n\nBoos cascaded from the stands.\n\nInside the capsule room, players started laughing.\n\n\"South Korea has nobody except Yura. Anyone else would be deadweight. She probably gave up on finding a partner.\"\n\n\"Poor girl.\"\n\n\"Honestly, it's impressive South Korea even qualified for the National Competition. A minor miracle they made the participant list. They should be satisfied with that.\"\n\n\"Right. South Korea has Yura and Peak Sword. That's it. Peak Sword didn't even show up.\"\n\n\"How did they qualify anyway? The selection quests were brutal.\"\n\n\"South Korea hosts the event. S.A. is a Korean company. Probably rigged.\"\n\n\"Maybe Yura slept with the right people. Heh.\"\n\nThe gossip rippled through the room. Yura's expression remained serene. She prepared to enter her capsule, ignoring the chatter.\n\nA British representative approached her. Regas struggled to hide his discomfort.\n\n\"Miss Yura, why are you participating alone?\" His Korean pronunciation was practiced but stilted. \"It was going to be difficult enough. Now you're fighting solo? Surely you aren't giving up like everyone's saying?\"\n\nYura switched to fluent English, sparing him the awkwardness. \"I don't know those words. 'Giving up.' Fighting alone is hard, but I'll win. So don't worry.\"\n\nYura's beauty and 5th rank status made her a global phenomenon. Most rankers had media exposure. Regas had never met her in person, but he'd watched enough interviews to know her personality.\n\n\"You mean it. You really plan to win alone?\" He shook his head. \"But how? Why are you playing without a partner?\"\n\n\"My partner can't be contacted.\"\n\n\"Partner?\"\n\nRegas's eyes widened. *Her teammate!* Anger flared. What kind of representative ghosted their team? He turned toward the capsule beside Yura's. The participant ID on the badge froze him mid-breath.\n\n\"Grid? Grid was supposed to partner with you?\"\n\n\"Grid didn't agree. I registered him without telling him.\" Yura shrugged. \"I don't blame him for not coming. He'll probably complain about my presumption.\"\n\n*Does Yura know Grid's identity? She wanted to rely on him?*\n\nSouth Korea would dominate if Grid participated in the National Competition. But Regas knew better. As a guild member, he understood Grid had no intention of competing.\n\n\"This will be a struggle.\" Regas's expression turned grim. \"The British team won't attack a lone Korean representative.\"\n\nYura smiled. Sharp. Predatory. \"You might get hurt if you ignore a lone woman.\"\n\nThe confidence of a top 5 player radiated from her. Regas caught himself. *Right. Nobody here is weak.*\n\nEveryone participating in the National Competition had earned their spot. Gaps existed between skill levels, but every representative was exceptional. Yura reminded him of that. He felt grateful for the chance to compete against the world's strongest.\n\nMeanwhile, Jishuka pouted in the Brazilian section.\n\n*What? Grid isn't coming?*\n\nThe shock of Grid ignoring her whispers in Satisfy had hurt. But she possessed a strong mental state. She'd checked every event Grid registered for in the National Competition. She'd looked forward to seeing him in target processing. Hoped they could meet.\n\nGrid never showed.\n\n*Really. I can't meet him even though I'm in South Korea?*\n\nHer first real romantic interest, and seeing his face proved impossible. The difficulty seemed excessive, even for a star.\n\n\"I'm angry.\" She forced her emotions down. Priorities mattered. She turned to her partner, Samuel. \"We enter the forest immediately after logging in.\"\n\nSamuel had the strongest fighting power among remaining Brazilian users, but his overall ranking was abysmal. Confusion crossed his face.\n\n\"As an archer, wouldn't you prefer the mountain peak? Easier to snipe from high ground.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it makes us a target. Seventeen teams are participating, not one. Standing out early invites attacks. We hide until enemies thin each other out.\"\n\n\"I see!\"\n\nJishuka led the Tzedakah Guild, one of Satisfy's strongest groups. Samuel recognized her superior tactical mind. He vowed to follow her orders without question.\n\nAll players entered their capsules.\n\nMoments later, the massive screens ringing the stadium flickered to life. Thirty-three players materialized across Tira's small but densely forested island. They spawned at regular intervals, allowing time to secure position. Most teams sprinted toward the mountains. A few, like Brazil, melted into the forest.\n\nYura aimed at small targets streaking through the sky.\n\n\"Dark Storm.\"\n\nThe world exploded.\n\n*BOOM.*\n\nSilence blanked the stadium. One-fifth of Tira's forest vanished, obliterated by the tempest. The commentators found their voices, trembling.\n\n*\"The South Korean team has acquired 28 points! The Italian team has been logged out!\"*\n\nShock rippled through the crowd. The competing players froze.\n\n\"What? Why are the Italians dead?\"\n\n\"The storm blew them off a cliff.\"\n\n\"That's insane.\"\n\n\"Look at that forest. What kind of magic is that? How high is her magic power?\"\n\n\"She's the Eighth Servant for a reason.\"\n\nThe 5th place on the unified rankings held special meaning. Since Satisfy launched, countless rankers tried to break through. The 5th rank never changed. Yura's wall proved too high, too solid. The 5th place remained insurmountable.\n\nWitnessing her power firsthand drove the point home. But the other competitors weren't afraid.\n\n*We're strong too.*\n\nRight now, she was a candle in a hurricane.\n\nThe United States waiting room buzzed with activity. Zibal watched the live feed on the monitors, smiling.\n\n\"She's going for a quick victory. Smart girl. I respect that.\"\n\nShe was outnumbered from the start. If enemies formed alliances and dragged out the fight, Yura would be helpless. She planned to win before the other teams organized. Hit hard, hit fast.\n\n\"But Yura.\" Zibal's smile sharpened. \"Don't underestimate the competition. Everyone here is wise and strong.\"\n\nHe felt certain. Yura would meet her end soon. This was her limit, despite her 5th rank.\n\nAt the same time, at the stadium entrance, Youngwoo paused.\n\n\"The crowd sounds incredible.\"\n\nHe walked forward."
