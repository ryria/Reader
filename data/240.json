Players might neglect their real lives, drowning in the virtual child's existence. Or they might abandon the digital offspring entirely, chasing the next quest. The system required maturity. Genuine maturity. Only users who demonstrated established values qualified for the parenting mechanics.\n\nGrid stared at the notification.\n\n*Can I really do this?*\n\nThe old Grid would have clicked 'yes' without hesitation. But he had learned caution. He understood consequences now. The weight of responsibility settled over him like plate armor.\n\n*I'm still...*\n\nStill immature. Still learning. The word 'father' felt foreign on his tongue. But Irene deserved happiness. She was precious. More precious than items. More precious than legendary drops. Through her, he had learned what it meant to love another person. He wanted to give her this. He refused to let her down.\n\n*I want this too. A child. Our child.*\n\nHours passed. Grid sat motionless in his chair, wrestling with the decision. Finally, he reached for the keyboard.\n\n\"I am grateful for the news of the pregnancy.\"\n\nThe system responded instantly.\n\n> [Congratulations on your wife's pregnancy!]\n\n> [The preferences and abilities of the child will be affected from prenatal development.]\n\n> [What type of child do you want? The child you want and the child your wife wants will affect prenatal development. Work hard to communicate with your wife.]\n\nGrid's hands hovered over the keys.\n\n\"I wish my child...\"\n\nThe image crystallized in his mind.\n\n*Someone different from me.*\n\nNo pettiness. No stupidity. Grid had spent years drowning in his own inadequacy, suffocating under debt and failure. His child deserved better. Needed better.\n\n*Someone like Irene. Bright. Generous. Beautiful. Intelligent.*\n\nHe typed carefully, each word measured.\n\n*I want a clever child to be born. Congratulations on your pregnancy. And thank you.*\n\nThe letter to Irene required three drafts before he felt satisfied. No traces remained of the careless boy he'd been. Grid would turn 28 in five months, real time. Fatherhood was forcing him to grow.\n\nHe leaned back, exhaling.\n\n\"Taemyeong means 'fortune.' Like hitting a jackpot...\"\n\nHis naming sense remained garbage. But at least he'd stopped there. At least he hadn't tried to name the actual child yet.\n\n***\n\nThe S.A. Group boardroom occupied the entire top floor. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooked the city. Executives sat in leather chairs around a table worth more than most users' annual salaries. The main agenda covered budget allocation for the Second National Competition in Paris. Standard business.\n\nThen someone mentioned Grid.\n\n\"Grid again!\" One executive slammed his palm on the table. \"Are we serious right now?\"\n\n\"The parenting system only activates for mature players.\" Another executive adjusted his glasses. \"The criteria are strict.\"\n\nThe operations team leader had delivered the report. The room erupted. Grid. The parenting system. These two concepts did not belong in the same sentence.\n\n\"We've been watching him since the beginning.\" The first executive shook his head. \"He sent us malicious emails when he couldn't make legendary items. Death threats over virtual swords. And now he's qualified to raise a child?\"\n\nSomeone muttered a curse.\n\nGames had implemented parenting systems before. Princess Mama. Virtual families. Child-raising simulators. Those games carried no weight. Users could delete children. Abandon them. Abuse them. The pixels didn't care. 2D sprites followed scripts. Nothing more.\n\nSatisfy was different.\n\nMorpheus gave NPCs perfect artificial intelligence. Thoughts. Emotions. Fears. Dreams. They weren't pixels. They were people. Virtual people, yes, but the distinction blurred with every interaction.\n\n\"If Grid neglects this child...\" The operations team leader cleared his throat. \"If he abuses it... We're looking at a PR nightmare. Lawsuits. Government investigations. The media would crucify us.\"\n\nThe parenting system was a blade that cut both ways. Used properly, it enhanced immersion. Misused, it could destroy the company.\n\nThat's why the activation requirements were brutal. Maximum affinity with the spouse. Maximum respect for NPCs. The system filtered ruthlessly. Only the most qualified users could trigger pregnancy.\n\n\"And yet Grid qualified.\" The first executive stood. \"There must be an error. A glitch. We need to rollback this immediately.\"\n\nDirector Yoon Sangmin cleared his throat.\n\nEveryone turned. Yoon Sangmin. The man who had hated Grid with visible passion. Who complained about Grid at every meeting. Who had once called Grid 'a stain on our playerbase.'\n\nYoon Sangmin met their stares without flinching.\n\n\"Don't you know about the recent Grid?\" His voice was calm. Measured. \"He has grown. He's different from the past. So don't worry.\"\n\n\"We all know his abilities have grown.\" The first executive crossed his arms. \"Three gold medals. Saving the kingdom from the golem army. Nobody's disputing his combat prowess. We're questioning his character.\"\n\n\"His character has grown too.\"\n\nSilence fell over the boardroom.\n\nThe executives exchanged glances. Someone coughed.\n\n\"How do you know that?\" The question came from the back of the room.\n\nYoon Sangmin pulled up footage on the main screen. Grid's recent actions played in fast-forward. Protecting NPCs. Treating subordinates fairly. Showing restraint. Growth.\n\n\"You'll see it quickly if you pay attention.\" Yoon Sangmin paused the footage. \"His inner development is visible in every action. And regardless of our opinions, the system chose him. Morpheus chose him. That means Grid is qualified. There's no room to negotiate.\"\n\nThe executives stared. Director Yoon Sangmin, defending Grid. The world had turned upside down.\n\nYoon Sangmin studied the frozen image of Grid on screen.\n\n*A human who learns and develops through the game.*\n\nMost people followed a predictable pattern. They matured through society. Work. Relationships. Responsibility. Then they used games to vent stress. Good people in real life became villains in virtual worlds. The pattern repeated endlessly.\n\nGrid reversed it.\n\nHe lacked social skills in reality. But Satisfy was teaching him. Growing him. Transforming him into something better. He was the perfect example of what the game could achieve. Perfect publicity material.\n\nIf Grid cooperated, anyway.\n\n***\n\n\"Shit!\"\n\nThe White Wolf Guild hall felt like a morgue. Quest failure. Total wipeout. One player had annihilated their entire force. Pride lay shattered on the floor like broken pottery.\n\nVeradin moved through the room, stopping at each dejected member.\n\n\"Don't mind it.\" His voice carried confidence. Authority. \"Grid is the best. It isn't a shame to be defeated by him.\"\n\nThe words landed. Stuck. Grid stood at the peak of the rankings. With Kraugel maintaining mysterious silence, Grid represented the strongest known force. His control might be lacking. His tactics might be crude. But his power was undeniable.\n\nVeradin was right. A small guild losing to Grid was expected. Natural. Like water flowing downhill.\n\nBut the guild members watched Veradin with worry etched into their faces.\n\nA month ago, Veradin had cleared an S+ grade quest. The reward had been Dantalian's bones. High-ranking demonkin remains. During the battle with Grid, Veradin had summoned the undead Dantalian.\n\nHis trump card.\n\nEven Grid had shown concern.\n\nVeradin with Dantalian was a force multiplier. He'd managed to pressure Grid despite being under level 300. Far above his ranking. His true abilities had shone through.\n\nThe problem was everyone else.\n\nThe guild members were weak. Useless. They'd dragged Veradin down like anchors on a sinking ship. The shame burned. Nobody could meet his eyes.\n\nKiki broke the silence.\n\n\"But Veradin.\" She tilted her head. \"Why didn't you report Grid to Earl Zebra?\"\n\nGrid was a duke of the Eternal Kingdom. His presence in imperial territory was a violation. A scandal. Reporting it to the upper ranks would create massive problems for Grid. Veradin held the key to revenge. Why wasn't he using it?\n\nVeradin smiled.\n\n\"It isn't time yet.\"\n\nThe vague answer settled over the room. Kiki nodded slowly. Veradin was playing a longer game. Something bigger.\n\n***\n\nKraugel had last visited the western Eternal Kingdom eight months ago.\n\nThe west had been a wasteland then. Pure desert. Monsters infested every dune. Taking a single step meant confronting enemies. Moving forward meant complete isolation. A death sentence for most players.\n\nEverything had changed.\n\nThe desert had shrunk. Monster populations had thinned. The area had transformed into viable hunting grounds. Kraugel analyzed the terrain as he walked. Grid had clearly destroyed multiple giant worm nests after becoming Lord of Reidan. Systematic elimination. Strategic planning.\n\nImpressive.\n\n*Grid exceeds the rumors.* Kraugel adjusted his straw hat against the sun. *After absorbing the Tzedakah Guild, he's building real power.*\n\nKraugel knew about Grid. Everyone knew about Grid. A global celebrity. But Kraugel had never paid special attention. Their playstyles diverged completely. Kraugel devoted himself to adventuring and hunting. Grid participated in external events. Politics. Territory management. Different worlds.\n\nKraugel assumed they'd never intersect.\n\n*My inventory's at capacity.* He checked his weight limit. Critical mass. *Is Reidan the only equipped city nearby?*\n\nTen days of monster hunting while traveling west. His inventory groaned with loot. Reidan was the logical choice for selling. Not to meet Grid. Just business.\n\nThe city materialized on the horizon.\n\n\"An agricultural city.\"\n\nKraugel stopped at the edge of the wheat fields. The crops stretched endlessly, golden under the desert sun. A city in the middle of a wasteland, growing food. Impossible. Yet here it stood.\n\n*He cleared the desert and developed infrastructure.* Kraugel resumed walking. *Management skills matching his combat ability.*\n\nGrid had dominated the National Competition. Crushed the golem army. But he'd also built this. A legendary blacksmith with top-ranked subordinates and territory development expertise. Near-perfect.\n\n*Zibal lacks this dimension.* Kraugel considered the implications. *The first player to become king might be Grid, not Zibal.*\n\nDid he feel regret?\n\nNo.\n\nKraugel enjoyed solo play. His path diverged from Grid's completely. Different activities. Different goals. No sense of crisis. No competition.\n\nHis boots crunched through the wheat stalks as he approached Reidan's gates.\n\nAn NPC emerged from the fields. The man held a rake in one hand and a hoe in the other. He stepped into Kraugel's path.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nKraugel stopped.\n\nThe NPC's eyes held an intensity that set off warning bells. This wasn't a normal farmer.\n\n***\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**\n\n**OG: Glossary Link.**\n\n**Current schedule: 20 chapters a week.**\n\n**Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
