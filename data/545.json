Though it resembles an ordinary pickaxe at first glance, closer inspection reveals hidden ingenuity—the blades on both sides can fold as needed, and half the hilt consists of a sharpened edge. It can function as a sword. However, its unconventional form makes it unsuitable for standard swordsmanship techniques.\n\n**Conditions of Use:** Mining or Farming skill. Advanced Mastery Level 1. **1,200 Strength**.  \n**Weight:** 880\n\n---\n\nPeak Sword hadn't understood the design when Grid first handed him this pickaxe. *Shouldn't a tool stay true to its purpose?* The whole concept had baffled him. Why transform a mining tool into a weapon? Why not just carry a proper blade alongside the pickaxe? The reasoning had eluded him completely.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe pickaxe's peculiar form allowed Peak Sword to adapt his swordsmanship style in ways a conventional weapon never could. He'd cut through the infiltration force on Cork Island like wheat before a scythe, then systematically dismantled the R77 unit.\n\n> [Your level has risen.]\n>\n> [You have neutralized the Eternal Navy's covert operation.]\n>\n> [A signal flare has been found on the dead enemy's body. It can be used to disturb the enemy.]\n\n\"God Grid...\" Peak Sword's voice caught with emotion. \"You're the best.\"\n\n*Grid must have foreseen this exact scenario.* The realization filled Peak Sword with awe. His respect for Grid deepened into something approaching worship.\n\nThe truth? Grid had designed the weapon-pickaxe hybrid purely for Piaro's benefit. But Peak Sword would never know that.\n\n---\n\n## The Flame Archer's Regret\n\nSkin bronzed from countless hours under the sun. Crimson hair that cascaded like living flame. Lips the color of ripe cherries. Jishuka, South America's most stunning beauty, stood atop Patrian's high walls and surveyed the approaching army.\n\n\"The participation rate increases every day,\" she observed, her tone conversational despite the gravity of the situation.\n\nAfter the Eternal Kingdom branded Grid and the Overgeared members as traitors, a deluge of quests had flooded every player within its borders.\n\n*Defeat Grid. Destroy Overgeared. Occupy Bairan. Seize Reidan. Capture Patrian. Take Grid's family hostage.*\n\nEach quest promised substantial rewards. The players had no reason to refuse—both for the material gain and to fulfill their duty as citizens of the Eternal Kingdom, sworn to suppress rebellion.\n\nThis was the power of Satisfy's immersion. Players weren't just gaming—they *lived* as heroes in another world. The line between player and citizen blurred until it vanished entirely.\n\n\"Why?\" Toban's voice trembled.\n\nJishuka turned to him, noting how he swallowed nervously. She understood his fear. The enemy numbers were staggering—ten thousand Eternal Kingdom soldiers formed the vanguard, average level 160. That force alone posed little threat to Overgeared's elite. But thousands of players accompanied them, including high-ranking competitors. The variety of classes and skill combinations created countless variables, each one potentially lethal.\n\nJishuka's laugh rang out, sharp and defiant.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" she asked.\n\n*Kkirik!*\n\nShe drew her bow, the motion fluid and practiced, and sighted down the battlefield.\n\n*Hwaruruk!*\n\nFlames erupted at the arrow's tip, casting dancing shadows across the wall.\n\n\"We'll sweep them all away.\" Her eyes narrowed. \"Or should we show mercy to dogs that bare their teeth at us?\"\n\n\"...Wait, what?\" Toban stared at her, dumbfounded.\n\n*Why isn't she afraid?* The woman didn't even flinch.\n\n*Kuwaaaaaang!*\n\nThe fire arrow streaked across the battlefield, a comet of destruction that detonated in the enemy's midst. The explosion consumed dozens of soldiers instantly. Even the veteran Eternal Kingdom players blanched.\n\n\"The red flame archer...\" one whispered. \"They say she's practically cheating during sieges.\"\n\n\"How do we even counter that arrow bombardment?\" another asked, voice hollow.\n\nWithin seconds, Jishuka's consecutive volleys transformed the battlefield into an inferno. Both sides—Eternal Kingdom forces and Overgeared members alike—watched in stunned silence as she demonstrated firepower optimized for mass annihilation.\n\nYet Jishuka felt only dissatisfaction.\n\n*I can't display my full power with this bow.* She'd commissioned it from Grid herself. Despite being twenty-two levels beyond its requirements, she'd never replaced it—there simply weren't better alternatives. *This weapon's ceiling is too low for my current abilities.*\n\n---\n\n## The Cautious Marquis\n\n*Marquis Steim is being more cautious than necessary.*\n\nIn Reidan, Lauel rubbed his temples against an oncoming headache. Securing Patrian had served one primary purpose—connecting Reidan to the North and securing Marquis Steim's support. Yet the Marquis watched from the sidelines, unwilling to commit unless Grid's path to the throne seemed certain.\n\n*He's not even nervous with Irene in Reidan.* \n\nThat fact troubled Lauel most. Marquis Steim loved his daughter deeply. Irene was his only heir, and Grid was Irene's husband. The logical conclusion seemed obvious—supporting Grid meant ensuring his daughter became queen and his grandson a prince.\n\nBut Marquis Steim proved more pragmatic than Lauel had calculated. The man distinguished cleanly between personal desires and political necessity. He refused to let bloodline cloud his judgment. One wrong choice could endanger millions of northern citizens. The Marquis prioritized their safety above family advancement, seeking absolute certainty before committing.\n\n\"Well...\" Lauel sighed. \"I can't blame him.\"\n\nHe understood and even respected the choice. Seeing a noble genuinely care for his people was refreshing. Still, the situation grated.\n\n*Your political accomplishments revived the North—I appreciate that. But those same people have become shackles. You can't be the tool we need.* \n\nWhen the kingdom was founded, Marquis Steim couldn't hold a key position. Lauel filed that mental note away and opened the ranker list. A habit. Monitoring high-ranker levels should be standard practice for anyone in his position.\n\n\"...Huh?\"\n\nLauel's eyes widened as he scanned the rankings, searching for potential hostile forces. He blinked, certain he'd misread.\n\nThree hours ago, Grid had been level 322. Now he showed 324.\n\n\"What the hell?\"\n\nGrid's level had been rising steadily in the East Continent, approaching fifteenth place in the unified rankings. But even accounting for that pace, gaining two full levels in three hours?\n\n\"He's ninth on the list?\" Lauel stared at the screen. \"Grid, what the hell are you doing over there?\"\n\n*Is this a bug?* He laughed, imagining the media frenzy this would cause, then felt a spike of anxiety.\n\n*Maybe he'll return to the West Continent much sooner than expected.* Would Grid arrive before the project to crown him king was complete?\n\n---\n\n## The Unnecessary Guardian\n\nShadows pooled in the corners. Faker's breathing slowed until it became imperceptible as he watched Irene and Lord. His focus remained absolute—any threat would be eliminated before it materialized.\n\nThen he noticed something. His protection wasn't needed.\n\n*A potato?*\n\nIrene sat reading with Lord cradled in her arms. Above them, a worker transporting potatoes to the garrison lost his grip. One rainbow-colored potato tumbled free, plummeting toward Irene's head.\n\nFaker tensed to move.\n\n\"Ahat!\" Lord's delighted laugh rang out.\n\nThe child's hand blurred. A dagger materialized and flew upward with such speed and stealth that Irene never noticed.\n\n*Peeok!*\n\nThe potato split perfectly in half. Faker's expression turned bemused.\n\n*My protection... isn't necessary.*\n\nLord's exceptional skill was only part of it. Two hundred women stood within range of Irene and Lord. Each had drawn weapons simultaneously, ready to intercept the potato. And lurking in Lord's shadow, Kasim—the King of Shadows—remained on constant vigil.\n\n\"...They're both safe in Reidan.\" Faker exhaled slowly.\n\nHe had nothing to do. *Is there anything more pointless than guarding the safest people in the world?*\n\n---\n\n## The Dungeon's Reward\n\n> [You have succeeded in killing 10 armored needles.]\n>\n> [The quest 'Subjugate the Armored Needles (1)' has been cleared.]\n>\n> [Affinity with the Red Phoenix Group has risen and 5 silver threads have been acquired.]\n>\n> [Affinity with the Red Phoenix has risen to the peak.]\n>\n> [The quest 'Subjugate the Armored Needles (2)' has been created.]\n\n**[Subjugate the Armored Needles (2)]**  \n<span class=\"s-rank\">Difficulty: S</span>\n\nA large number of armored needles infest the dungeon beneath Pangea Castle. Bring peace to Pangea by eliminating those who threaten it.\n\n**Quest Clear Conditions:** Kill 20 armored needles.  \n**Quest Clear Reward:** 5 silver thread.\n\nGrid studied the notification, calculating. Ten armored needles had yielded only two silver threads as drops. The drop rate was abysmal. Quest completion seemed like the only reliable method to acquire them.\n\n*But five threads for killing twenty...*\n\nThe armored needles spawned too infrequently. Hunting twenty would consume substantial time.\n\n*Two days if my luck runs true to form,* Grid estimated grimly.\n\nHe sighed and exited the dungeon with the Red Phoenix Group.\n\n\"Oh! Pangea's Duke of Virtue! You're safe!\" White rushed forward.\n\n\"Grid!\" Han Seokbong called out.\n\nAt the well's entrance, both men waited despite half a day passing since Grid had descended. Their concern was evident.\n\nHan Sua stepped forward to explain. She recounted Grid's overwhelming strength against the armored needles and his condemnation of Arube's actions.\n\nHan Seokbong's regard for Grid visibly warmed.\n\n\"You've gone through considerable trouble, Duke of Virtue,\" Han Seokbong said. \"Your assistance was invaluable. You must be exhausted and famished. I've prepared delicacies that can only be enjoyed in Pangea, specifically for you.\"\n\n> [Lord Han Seokbong is feeling more favorable toward you.]\n>\n> [There is a place for you to stay in Pangea Castle. It is a place with hot springs for stamina recovery.]\n>\n> [All facilities of Pangea Castle are available free of charge and you will be served meals whenever you want.]\n\n\"Delicacies...\"\n\nGrid's stomach growled audibly. Starvation clawed at his insides. The mere mention of quality food made his mouth water.\n\nBut Grid had learned—painfully—that effort and patience always yielded rewards. He wrestled his appetite into submission.\n\n\"The meal...\" His voice caught slightly. \"I'll eat outside.\"\n\nIdan's restaurant waited. Securing stat increases mattered more than avoiding food poisoning. Grid swallowed his disappointment and departed the castle, feet dragging with each reluctant step. He retrieved the Unknown Mark and Arube's Ring from his inventory.\n\n*I shouldn't get my hopes up...* He steeled himself. \"Legendary Blacksmith's Appraisal.\"\n\nTime to acknowledge reality: most of his predictions went sideways anyway."
