  "content": "Chris staggered backward, his upper body trembling as he absorbed Grid's relentless barrage. Each clash of steel sent shockwaves up his arms. The giant of the Giant Guild was losing the contest of raw strength.\n\n---\n\nThe waiting room assigned to third-round participants was silent save for the distant roar of the crowd. Kraugel sat alone, eyes fixed on the arena feed.\n\n*Chris is being overwhelmed in pure power?*\n\nThe thought jarred him. He'd never considered the possibility. Chris possessed a unique strength stat that made him unrivaled in physical contests. Even Kraugel himself couldn't match the man in a test of brute force.\n\nYet Grid was winning.\n\n*The more I learn about him, the deeper the mystery runs.*\n\nMost people had limits. Expose them long enough, and you'd eventually scrape bottom. See the foundation beneath the facade. Grid defied that logic. Every encounter revealed new dimensions. New strengths.\n\nKraugel leaned forward, a rare excitement building in his chest.\n\n*Could he be the one?*\n\nThe 'Beat Baal's Contractor' quest. Agnus, the necromancer growing into a monster in real-time. Grid might be the only player capable of standing against him.\n\nHe tempered the thought.\n\n*That's a problem for the distant future.*\n\nThe immediate question surfaced. *Have they even met? Grid and Agnus?*\n\nKraugel filed the curiosity away and returned his attention to the match.\n\n---\n\nMost greatswords followed a simple design philosophy. Linear. Brutal. The aesthetic of overwhelming force.\n\nGrid's blue blade rejected that tradition entirely.\n\n<span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Failure</span> was sleek, curved like a shark's fin cutting through water. Three-dimensional details wrapped the weapon in elegant lethality. If a standard greatsword was Rambo, this weapon was Pexri. Beautiful and terrifying in equal measure.\n\nChris deflected another strike, his arms screaming. \"Why the hell is it named Failure?\"\n\nThe answer was academic. The weapon outclassed everything in his arsenal.\n\n*Clang! Crash!*\n\nChris's boots scraped across the platform as he gave ground. His eyes narrowed, searching for an opening that didn't exist. The psychological damage cut deeper than the physical.\n\n*I can't be Kraugel.*\n\nHe'd accepted that truth long ago. Made peace with it. Chris had chosen his path. Attack power. Pure, overwhelming destructive force. He'd promised himself mastery in that single domain.\n\nAfter acquiring the Tyrant second class and Grid's Greatsword, he'd believed he'd reached the summit.\n\nReality was crushing that belief with every exchange.\n\n\"What is that weapon?\" Chris ground out between parries. \"You made it over a year ago. Why is it stronger than Grid's Greatsword?\"\n\nChris knew greatswords. Knew them better than anyone. The blue blade in Grid's hands was objectively superior. The best he'd ever seen.\n\nGrid's expression softened slightly. \"Failure is the origin. Grid's Greatsword is... technically the mass-produced version.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThe weapon Chris had considered the pinnacle two minutes ago was mass production? His jaw clenched.\n\n\"I see.\" The words came out flat. \"That's why you never enhanced Grid's Greatsword to +9. No point investing in disposable equipment.\"\n\n*I asked for his best. He gave me a factory model.*\n\nBetrayal prickled at the back of Chris's skull. Grid's eyes widened.\n\n\"Wait, you're misunderstanding.\" He parried a heavy slash. \"Grid's Greatsword is actually superior to Failure. The option effects are far more valuable. Failure only wins on raw attack power.\"\n\n\"Attack power is the only stat that matters in a weapon!\"\n\n*Clang!*\n\nTheir blades met again. Energy burst from the impact point, scattering across the platform.\n\nGrid grimaced. \"Fair point. The attack power is exceptional.\"\n\n*But it's still a failure.*\n\nThe usage requirements were so absurd that no player could equip it. Couldn't be sold. Couldn't be used.\n\n*Except Chris might reach those stats in a year.*\n\n*And by then, I'll have something even better.*\n\nThe thought brought a wide smile to Grid's face. Superiority was intoxicating. He'd spent so much of his life on the losing side. Crushed. Mocked. This reversal was sweeter than any victory condition.\n\nBut Grid wasn't stupid. Gloating came after winning.\n\n\"Pagma's Swordsmanship.\"\n\n*Clang! Crash!*\n\nGrid stepped into the sword dance. His horizontal slash transitioned seamlessly as his waist pivoted.\n\n\"Linked Kill.\"\n\nThis was different from a year ago. Everyone had grown. Everyone had become stronger. That made this victory taste better. Defeating a true powerhouse validated everything Grid had built.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nThe first energy blade screamed forward like a cannonball.\n\nChris's response was simple. Brutal. He blocked it head-on.\n\n*He has to*, Grid noted. *His agility is too low for dodging.*\n\nMeanwhile, Grid's own agility exceeded 2,000 points.\n\n\"Smash!\"\n\n*BOOM!*\n\nChris's unique skill, Tyrant's Destruction, collided with Linked Kill. The shockwave rattled the platform like an earthquake. Dust exploded from the impact point.\n\n\"The attack power...\" One of the commentators struggled for words. \"How high are their stats?\"\n\n\"200 ton Sword!\"\n\n*CRASH!*\n\nThe second Linked Kill met Chris's next skill. Their cloaks whipped violently in the resulting windstorm.\n\n\"God Hands!\"\n\nGrid called the golden constructs as his third consecutive Linked Kill launched. The God Hands converged on Chris instantly, weapons raised.\n\nChris grunted through the pain and activated 300 ton Sword, canceling the third Linked Kill.\n\n\"Kuk!\"\n\nGrid choked back a groan. Chris had started overwhelming him at 200 ton Sword. The 300 ton Sword felt like trying to stop a landslide.\n\n> [The durability of **Failure** has decreased by 20.]\n\n*That's massive damage!*\n\nGrid's admiration for Chris paled next to Chris's appreciation of Grid.\n\n*He's a mountain.*\n\nChris had known from the opening exchange. He couldn't break through Grid's defense. Couldn't outlast him. But frustration never entered the equation. This was exhilarating. Fighting someone who matched him in pure strength made his blood sing.\n\n\"1,000 ton Sword!\"\n\nThe ultimate destructive skill erupted in response to the fourth Linked Kill. The momentum exceeded even Kill's devastating power. The third-advancement ultimate lived up to its legendary-tier reputation.\n\nGrid's face went pale. *Do I need Blackening?*\n\nHe braced for impact.\n\n*CRASH!*\n\nThe 1,000 ton Sword tore through the fourth Linked Kill like paper and slammed into Grid's chest.\n\n> [You have suffered **25,900** damage.]\n> [The durability of **Triple Layers** has decreased by 55.]\n> [The durability of **Thick Helmet** has decreased by 21.]\n> [The durability of **Largest Gloves** has decreased by 15.]\n> [The durability of **Shiny Leggings** has decreased by 34.]\n\n\"Kuak!\"\n\nChris's passive skills, Defense Penetration and the Tyrant's bonus damage proportional to enemy defense, created explosive synergy. Even Grid's legendary armor that reduced physical damage couldn't fully absorb the blow.\n\nBlood sprayed across Grid's torso. He wheezed but remained standing.\n\n\"Interesting.\" Grid wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"Would I have died if 3 Joint Attacks had triggered? Let's find out who drops first.\"\n\nAn eye for an eye. Grid straightened his posture and prepared Pagma's Swordsmanship, Pinnacle Kill.\n\nThe system announcement interrupted everything.\n\n> 『 **Chris has been defeated!** 』\n\n\"What?\"\n\nChris turned to grey light and vanished. Throughout the entire exchange with Grid, the God Hands had been systematically chipping away at his health. They'd finally depleted his last point.\n\nGrid lowered his blade. \"Ah.\"\n\nVictory felt hollow. He'd won, but not in the way he'd wanted.\n\n---\n\n\"Couldn't you have held on for one more strike?\"\n\nGrid's complaint echoed in the waiting area. He'd been beaten bloody and wanted payback.\n\nChris, by contrast, looked refreshed. Content. \"That was a clean fight. No tricks. No deception. I lost, but it felt good.\"\n\nHe extended his hand. \"Let's do it again sometime.\"\n\nGrid studied him with narrowed eyes. The eagle evaluating prey. Then he laughed and clasped Chris's hand.\n\n\"Let's grab a drink sometime.\"\n\nThe tension bled away. Grid felt lighter.\n\n---\n\nThe round-of-eight waiting room.\n\nKatz wasn't alone. Lauel sat across from him.\n\n\"Should I tell you how to beat Grid now?\" Lauel asked as soon as the match concluded.\n\nKatz snorted. \"I'll win because I'm stronger. Simple as that.\"\n\nLauel's expression didn't change. \"Confidence is good. But if you want better odds, listen to what I have to say.\"\n\nHe began explaining. Lauel knew Grid better than anyone. He laid out weaknesses, patterns, exploitable habits.\n\nKatz frowned halfway through. \"You're giving away too much. What if I become Grid's enemy later?\"\n\nLauel shrugged. \"You want his items. That makes long-term hostility unlikely.\"\n\nThat was only part of the answer. The real reason ran deeper.\n\n\"Grid is evolving right now. Faster than anyone can track. The weaknesses I'm describing? He'll have overcome them before you could exploit them twice.\"\n\nKatz blinked. *He sounds like Damian.*\n\nThe appearance of a Grid worshipper, right down to the zealous gleam in his eyes."
