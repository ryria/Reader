  "content": "Heroes of old, drawn by sacred hymns, had raised temples to the goddess and nurtured the first saint—who became both pope and champion. From that legend arose the Rebecca Church. The Holy Sword was the first manifestation of the goddess's will, the pope's symbol, the church's pride.\n\nThough it had lost all function after being driven into stone at the end of the Dark War, its symbolic weight remained immeasurable. At least, that's what the Rebecca Church believed.\n\n*Our most sacred relic—in the hands of those filth!*\n\nFrom the eldest prelates to the lowest priests, every believer reeled. Their holiest treasure, forbidden to all outsiders, now clutched in a Yatan Servant's defiled grasp? Unthinkable.\n\n[The Sword Stuck in the Rock has fallen to the Yatan Church!]\n\n[Rebecca Church morale has plummeted.]\n\n[All Rebecca Church members: Defense and Magic Resistance -60%.]\n\n[The pope's duty is to lead. Your morale remains steady.]\n\n[The Sword Stuck in the Rock is contaminated by Yatan's essence! Its residual divine power flickers and dims!]\n\n[All Rebecca Church members: Confused for 10 seconds. Cannot act.]\n\n[The pope's duty is to lead. You resist confusion.]\n\nThe system's protection held Damian's mind intact, but his composure shattered regardless.\n\n\"What...?\" The worst scenario he'd never imagined suddenly made real. Sealed in this cursed barrier, cut off from the world outside, confusion overwhelmed him. Screams echoed beyond the dark prison. The church teetered on the brink—and he could do nothing.\n\n*Is this even possible to clear?*\n\nCompletely restrained. Severed from the battle. The entire Rebecca Church in crisis, and he couldn't lift a finger.\n\n*Think. Think, damn it!*\n\nYears of consuming every anime, manga, and film he could find suddenly proved useful. He forced himself to step back, to view Satisfy's world design like a reader analyzing a story's structure.\n\n*The Rebecca Church can't fall. Not logically.* With the Yatan Church and other dark forces working to resurrect the Great Demons across the world, the Rebecca Church's destruction would shatter the world's balance completely.\n\nHell on earth. No dreams. No hope. Chairman Lim Cheolho had promised a world where players could achieve what reality denied them. Why would he design this dystopia?\n\n*Impossible. The world's narrative won't allow the church to collapse.*\n\nCertainty steadied him, even as the weight of realization crushed down. The burden settling on his shoulders threatened to break him.\n\n*The fate of the world rests on me alone.*\n\nIf the Rebecca Church fell, the world ended. And only he could prevent it. The pressure should have paralyzed him. Would have, if his spirit were ordinary. But years of defending his passions against mockery had forged something unbreakable.\n\nAfter all, someone ordinary wouldn't have shouted \"Isabel, I love you!\" in official meetings. Wouldn't have kept praising Grid-sama despite universal ridicule. Damian was anything but ordinary.\n\n*This is incredible!*\n\nThe crushing pressure transformed into blazing excitement. Anxiety vanished from his eyes.\n\nThat's right. Damian was a protagonist. The same breed as Grid.\n\n*Think it through again.*\n\nRecognizing the crisis as surmountable, he forced his mind into overdrive. After a moment, a hypothesis emerged: *What if an NPC were pope when this happened?*\n\nAn NPC pope would likely overcome this easily—forewarned by divine message, flexibly adapting to pre-designed scenarios. But players? They stumbled into crises blind, at a severe disadvantage compared to NPCs.\n\nThen again... *Players face more disadvantages than NPCs, but we have unique advantages too. Think like player Damian, not Pope Damian.*\n\nExplosions thundered closer together. Through the shattered ceiling, Rebecca followers' screams pierced the air. Damian clenched his jaw, forcing himself to ignore their suffering. He couldn't spare them even a second. He had to think.\n\n***\n\n\"Kikikik! Kihahahahahat!\"\n\nAgnus's wild laughter echoed through the hall, his hair a chaotic tangle from sustained combat. Two demons already slain. Others wounded. He'd lost two death knights—only Lich Mumud remained.\n\nYatan's Fourth Servant, Silvenas, was in rough shape too. Gasping. Drenched in blood. A named NPC of a major faction, and a single player pushed her to her limit.\n\nRose, dominating Chucksley, felt a chill of horror at the sight.\n\n*Silvenas is level 420.*\n\nA player in the 300s dealing that much damage alone? No ordinary level 300 could pressure Silvenas like this. Legendary classes were more terrifying than expected. Fierce jealousy coiled in Rose's chest as she aimed her staff at Chucksley sprawled on the ground—the golden-named NPC who'd served as Eternal's blade, now Overgeared's shield.\n\nRage shook her hands. This NPC had stalled her for ten minutes.\n\n\"Because of you, I couldn't hunt enough followers! Trash like you interfering—!\"\n\nShe'd received subquests to slaughter Rebecca's faithful. Precious quests that boosted intelligence for every priest and paladin killed. She'd expected massive growth from this bloodbath, but one NPC ruined everything. The other Yatan Servants and black magicians had reaped most of the prey already.\n\n\"Die! Wrapped in thorns—die! Tempting Thorns!\"\n\nPurple vines erupted from cracked stone. Blade-sharp thorns coiled toward Chucksley's body—\n\nA dagger flashed through the air, severing the vine crawling up Chucksley's ankle.\n\n\"...!?\"\n\nRose whipped around as Chucksley's face flushed with emotion.\n\n\"Your Highness...\"\n\n\"What?\" Rose barely trusted her ears. She knew Chucksley served Grid's son. Knew Lord was five or six years old. Yet there he stood, at the end of her gaze.\n\n*That child threw the dagger? Cut the vine?*\n\nAbsurd.\n\nDenying reality, Rose aimed her staff at Chucksley again. A second dagger flew, striking her throat precisely.\n\n[You have suffered 1,300 damage.]\n\n[Casting forcibly canceled.]\n\n\"You're kidding—!\"\n\nShe yanked the thin blade from her neck, turning back to Lord. Those eyes—identical to his father's—stared back at her.\n\n\"You!\"\n\nA monster that must not be allowed to grow. Instinct screamed the warning. Rose prepared a new spell—this time targeting Lord directly. The boy drew another dagger. Throwing techniques Kasim had drilled into him before he could even toddle, now unleashed.\n\n\"Kkh—! Gah!\" Another blade pierced her throat. Casting canceled again! The little prince's daggers couldn't deal lethal damage through her legendary armor, but they disrupted her perfectly. Fury blazed white-hot.\n\n\"You—! You really are your father's son!\"\n\nRose blamed Grid and Overgeared for her death in the Belial raid. She held no mercy for Grid—or his child, no matter how young. Conjuring a shield against Lord's daggers, she began chanting.\n\n\"No!\" Coke and Royman broke away from the black magicians, gazes snapping to Lord. Coke threw himself forward, intending to shield the boy with his body—\n\n*Thud.*\n\nHe collapsed, stamina depleted. Instead, he watched Agnus—locked in struggle with Silvenas—reach out toward Lord.\n\nAgnus's golden eyes blazed as his attention shifted backward. Rose casting magic at Lord. At Irene.\n\n\"This bitch!\"\n\n\"Selling an opening?\"\n\n\"Kuk...!\"\n\nBad. Rose's disgrace ignited something irreversible in Agnus. With his focus on Rose, Silvenas moved freely. She phased through Mumud's magic, materialized at Agnus's back, and thrust her weapon toward his heart.\n\n\"Ah...!\" Irene's eyes widened in horror. Her son and savior both in mortal danger. Only one option remained.\n\n\"I'm sorry. Truly sorry.\" Agnus and Coke both gasped apologies—efforts wasted. Irene sprinted forward, throwing herself over her young son. The only protection she could offer. She squeezed her eyes shut, waiting for death. Her body would be the shield that let him survive.\n\n\"Your Majesty!\" Chucksley surged upright, transcending his limits once more. His blade arced toward Rose—but her casting time was shorter. The spell completed. A massive lance of magic hurtled straight at Irene and Lord. Agnus couldn't reach them. Silvenas clung to him like a vice.\n\n\"Kik...! Kikikik! Kihahahahat!\"\n\n*Again?*\n\nHe'd grown stronger. Still couldn't save a woman? Shame flooded Agnus's eyes—\n\nThen a voice reached him.\n\n\"Thank you for buying time, Agnus-chan.\"\n\nA holy voice. Someone who'd taken his own life to resurrect at the Vatican. Damian—who'd escaped the dark barrier in the most player-like way possible.\n\nHe descended between Irene and Lord, turning to face Agnus and Silvenas. A brilliant golden magic circle blazed to life, annihilating black magic in a purifying shockwave that billowed Damian's white vestments. As Irene and Lord opened their eyes, they glimpsed divine armor gleaming beneath those robes. Confirming his mother's safety, Lord smiled at the person he trusted most after his father.\n\n\"Teacher Damian!\"\n\n\"Sorry I'm late. I'll protect Lord-chan and your mother now.\"\n\nThe pope's grandeur captivated everyone present. Bathed in the goddess's blessing, he radiated power—this man who matched Sword Saint Kraugel blade-for-blade, who helped the Overgeared King build his legend, who learned farming at Piaro's side.\n\nOne of the game's absolute strongest overwhelmed them all."
