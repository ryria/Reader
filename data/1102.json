  "content": "The elves had always been few in number—a consequence of their extended lifespans and meager fertility. Scattered across the continent's forests despite their small population, they endured not through breeding, but through dominance.\n\nThey were apex predators. An upper species that surpassed even vampires and evil eyes in raw potential.\n\nAnd yet, they had chosen harmony. Chosen peace with humanity.\n\nThat choice had been their mistake.\n\n\"Black thing...?\" One elf's voice carried through the canopy, wary and cold.\n\nThe intruder below didn't flinch. \"Your old colleague. I need the flesh of the fallen.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean.\"\n\nFive elves concealed themselves within the giant tree's embrace, bows already drawn. Their patience had worn thin. Kir's betrayal still festered like an open wound. One of the 12 Te had fallen because of human treachery. The lesson had been carved into their flesh: harmony with humans was impossible.\n\n\"This is your final warning, human. Leave the forest. Now.\"\n\n\"Shut up and tell me where the black thing is.\"\n\n\"Then you die.\"\n\nThe elves loosed their arrows without hesitation. Wind elementals blessed each shaft with impossible speed, turning the man below into a pincushion before he could even scream.\n\nBlood sprayed. The intruder—the name *Agnus* flickering above his head—crumpled to the forest floor. Beasts surged from the underbrush at the elves' silent command, tearing into the body with fang and claw. Bones snapped. Organs ruptured. Crimson pooled across moss and root.\n\nThe elves descended from their perch to recall the predators, already turning back to their posts.\n\n\"It hurts.\"\n\nThey froze.\n\nThe corpse sat up. Agnus twisted his neck at an unnatural angle, grinning through blood-slicked teeth. \"Hiding in trees is annoying.\"\n\n\"You're... not human.\"\n\nDeath should have been final. That was the law of nature, the sacred order. What stood before them violated that fundamental truth, and the elves—beings who embodied life eternal—recoiled from the wrongness of it.\n\nDark hands erupted from the soil.\n\nThe spectral limbs seized elves and beasts alike, draining vitality in ravenous gulps. Youth withered in seconds. Immortal flesh sagged and wrinkled as centuries caught up all at once. The beasts collapsed into desiccated husks.\n\nAgnus' wounds closed. His broken bones mended. Color returned to his cheeks as life flowed from his victims into his veins.\n\n\"You lasted longer than the animals.\" He approached the withered elves with measured steps, admiring their suffering. One hand closed around a white-haired throat, fingers sinking into tissue-paper skin. \"Same hair color as that black thing. I came to the right place after all.\"\n\nThe elf choked, unable even to struggle.\n\n\"Tell me where she is. I'll make it quick.\"\n\n\"...Go to hell... I don't know...\"\n\n\"No?\" Agnus' grip tightened. \"Then I'll burn every tree in this forest until I find her myself.\"\n\nNo madness gleamed in those gold eyes. Just cold, methodical certainty. The man who had once been chaos incarnate now moved with purpose—and that made him infinitely more dangerous.\n\nHe strangled the elf to death and discarded the corpse like refuse. The others followed quickly. Then he turned toward the forest's heart, where an unnatural stillness waited.\n\n\"Come out, Beniyaru.\"\n\nA dark elf. The first to accept demonic energy. Her unique physiology, combined with the Stone of Life...\n\nAgnus walked deeper into the trees, conviction guiding every step. In his withered hand, he clutched a portrait—paint faded and edges worn.\n\nHis former lover smiled up at him from the canvas.\n\n---\n\n> **[You have been defeated in a spar.]**\n>\n> **[You have been defeated in a spar.]**\n>\n> **[You have been defeated...]**\n\nGrid collapsed onto his back, chest heaving. \"Wow. You're impossible to beat.\"\n\nThanks to the equipment Grid had forged for him, Teruchan had evolved into something magnificent. Improved coefficients for attack power, defense, and health. Skills like **5 Joint Attacks**, **Bisect**, and **Crush**—all of which cost zero mana. The orc lord had become a monster.\n\nNot that Grid minded losing. He was *thrilled*.\n\nFor once, the infuriating game logic of \"powerful enemies become weak allies\" had failed to trigger. Teruchan remained just as terrifying now as he'd been before pledging loyalty.\n\n*People who can beat him? I could count them on one hand. Player or NPC.*\n\nKing Maxong had proven that peak-of-species NPCs transcended ordinary limits. Teruchan stood at level 500, wielding **Failure**—a weapon that crippled anyone more than ten levels below its wielder.\n\n*Piaro and Mercedes could take him, probably. They're immune to fear, can read all his moves, and their stats are ridiculous. Still, Teruchan's racial bonuses to strength and stamina...*\n\nGrid's thoughts trailed off as he raised a hand in surrender. \"Let's call it. I can't move a finger.\"\n\nTeruchan, meanwhile, looked fresh as morning dew. The orc lord's stamina was inhuman—fitting for his race. \"Grid. Gruruk. You would have won if you'd fought seriously.\"\n\n\"Haha, you don't need to comfort me. I'm happy to lose to you.\"\n\nNineteen years old and already this considerate. Grid smiled and pulled up the **God Hands'** information.\n\n---\n\n> **[God Hand]**\n>\n> **Rating:** Myth  \n> **Durability:** Infinite  \n> **Dexterity:** 2,583 | **Strength:** 1,795  \n>\n> *An artifact forged from Greed by Grid, who walks the path to myth. It perfectly reproduces Grid's hands, allowing unrestricted use of any item and blacksmithing functions.*\n>\n> *Hexetia, God of Blacksmiths, covets it with unbridled envy.*\n>\n> **Effects:**\n> * Applies 50% of owner's strength and dexterity.\n> * Can replicate owner's unique skills at 30% power (consumes owner's mana).\n> * Item-based skills function at full power without resource cost. Buff skills affect the owner.\n> * Possesses **Advanced Blacksmith's Craftsmanship**.\n> * Possesses **Advanced Weapons Mastery** and **Shield Mastery**.\n> * High chance to trigger **Crush** on attack.\n> * Chance to trigger **Reconstruction** when struck.\n> * +10% defense in canyon terrain.\n> * +20% wide-area skill damage in canyon terrain.\n> * Reduces target's defense and magic resistance by 10% against great demons ranked 22nd or lower.\n> * If damaged enough to be destroyed, durability is fixed for 5 seconds. Recovers 10% durability afterward (24-hour cooldown).\n> * No magic currently attached.\n> * Easily increases affinity through use.\n>\n> **Restrictions:** Grid only.  \n> **Weight:** 21\n\n---\n\nThe new **God Hands** vastly outperformed their predecessors. Not through radical changes—just pure refinement. That made sense. They were modeled after *his* hands. Their essence was replication. Alter that, and they'd cease to be **God Hands** at all.\n\n*Don't lose sight of the core concept.*\n\nThe fact that even a god coveted his creation filled Grid with quiet pride. *Myth*-rated. He was approaching the realm of divinity itself.\n\n*Will I actually become a god when I hit myth rating?*\n\nHe'd never taken the idea seriously before. But now, having witnessed gods firsthand, curiosity gnawed at him. Gods in Satisfy weren't omnipotent. Flawed. Vulnerable. Which meant players could ascend to their ranks...\n\n*I want more God Hands.*\n\nFour had been his limit when manual control was required. But these new models possessed autonomy—they made judgments and acted independently. He could deploy them without micromanagement.\n\n*A hundred God Hands would make me unstoppable. Not that the system would allow it.*\n\nGame balance would impose restrictions. Penalties, limitations. He needed to test the actual cap.\n\n*Fine. I'll forge a helmet next, then focus on God Hands.*\n\nHe was still stuck with that degraded **Cone Helmet**. Embarrassing. But that project had to wait for Greed to proliferate further.\n\n*And I need to decide what to do with the Water Clan King's Tear.*\n\nPreviously, he'd used one to grant **Magic Missile** to the **God Hands**. But his intelligence now exceeded 3,000. Though his **Great Magician** class had transformed into **Duke of Wisdom**, he still hoped to learn **Fireball**.\n\n*When Braham wakes up and sees my growth, he'll teach me new spells. I'll save the tears for that.*\n\nThe tears were increasingly rare. Maxong had wept every five months once, then yearly. Now? Even less. Grief for his dead daughter had dulled, replaced by duty to his people.\n\n*Unfortunate. But also good, I suppose. Better to save them than risk damaging them during disassembly.*\n\nLearning new magic depended on Braham's awakening. Grid chose optimism. The more his intelligence grew, the more Braham's soul should recover.\n\n*Right. I'll hunt while I wait. For Braham's sake.*\n\nHe stood, resolve hardening—\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nGrid's heart stopped.\n\nTeruchan froze mid-breath. The air itself seemed to crystallize.\n\nA girl materialized before them without warning, her presence suffocating despite her small frame. The dragon child. The hatchling who could unmake kingdoms on a whim.\n\nNefelina.\n\n\"W-Why did—you—a shabby person like you—come to this precious place?!\" Grid's panic mangled his words.\n\nNefelina's frown deepened. \"The movements of the different species. The agents of the great evil. They've provoked *her*.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Grid's confusion was genuine.\n\n\"The being who slept in the deepest dark.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"The woman who can claim the vampire king's throne.\"\n\nRealization struck like lightning. *Marie Rose.*\n\n\"She's taking an interest in the world again.\"\n\nGrid's mouth went dry. An absolute being from another dimension—a force of nature that had slumbered through centuries—stirring because of recent events?\n\n\"I don't want to lose my current home,\" Nefelina said, amber eyes boring into him. \"You need to soothe her.\"\n\nShe vanished as abruptly as she'd arrived.\n\nGrid stood frozen, a statue carved from shock and dread."
