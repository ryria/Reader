If there was one thing he excelled at, it was performing under pressure. And unlike most raid bosses, the enemies he'd faced weren't mindless monsters howling \"Kuwoooh!\" before charging.\n\nSatisfy's named bosses shaped the game's world. Each possessed distinct personalities, histories, and motivations. That singularity had taught Grid an unconventional approach. Where others memorized attack patterns and cooldown timers, he studied psychology. Understanding a boss's nature, their drives and obsessions, turned impossible fights into winnable ones.\n\nThe Pascal raid hadn't been a test of strength. It had been theater. Manipulation. Grid had orchestrated the entire scenario to ensure victory.\n\n*I could've been a raid consultant,* Grid thought idly. *Selling strategies to guilds. Making actual money from this talent.*\n\nThe idea died as quickly as it formed. He lacked the business acumen to monetize anything.\n\n*Elfin Stone is the key.*\n\nGrid's mind worked through the problem. The vampire earl could annihilate their entire party whenever he wished. Yet over four days, he'd killed only one person per night. Why the restraint?\n\n*Entertainment.*\n\nElfin Stone savored their terror. Each calculated murder maximized fear, watching them fracture under the psychological pressure.\n\n*He wants us scared and broken.*\n\nIf the vampire simply wanted them dead, he'd have slaughtered everyone immediately.\n\n*That would end the game too quickly.*\n\nThe earl didn't want corpses. He wanted toys.\n\n*I can use this.*\n\nGrid's expression darkened as the plan solidified.\n\n\"Rapid Pressure.\"\n\nPeeeeeong!\n\nWhile Grid strategized, the Overgeared members fought desperately. Huroi maintained aggro through constant provocation, allowing Vantner to focus on defense while the damage dealers attacked from multiple angles.\n\nThey moved like a precision instrument. Each member's unique abilities created synergies that amplified their total output beyond simple addition. These were top-twenty rankers, the best players in the world, demonstrating exactly why they held those positions.\n\nFaker's performance bordered on supernatural. His speed made even Elfin Stone's reactions seem sluggish. The assassin's dagger opened crimson lines across pale flesh before the vampire could shift into smoke form.\n\nBut Blood Field negated everything. Elfin Stone recovered over 1,000 health per second by draining the Overgeared members. His total health pool seemed bottomless. Grid estimated eight million. Impossible to burn down with just eight players.\n\n\"Lightning Kill!\"\n\nKwajijijik!\n\nRegas' fist punched clean through Elfin Stone's chest. The vampire's torso dissolved into smoke at the point of impact, reforming instantly.\n\n\"Got you!\"\n\nWithout retracting his arm, Regas twisted his entire body. His heel arced toward Elfin Stone's skull. An unorthodox, flowing strike.\n\n\"Kkuk...!\"\n\nElfin Stone grunted. He'd anticipated a follow-up punch, not the spinning kick. Before he could recover, Pon closed the distance.\n\n\"Rain Spear!\"\n\nPepeng! Pepepeng!\n\nThe spearman leapt, his weapon blurring into a downpour of thrusts. An unavoidable skill. Elfin Stone could transform his entire body to smoke to evade, but the technique created massive recovery lag. He'd be helpless afterward.\n\n\"Blood Shield!\"\n\nJjejeong! Jjeejeeeong!\n\nElfin Stone converted his own health into scarlet barriers. Dozens of shields materialized, intercepting Pon's assault mid-air.\n\nPuk! Puk puk!\n\nFaker materialized behind the vampire. His dagger found the neck again and again, exploiting Iyarugt's combo system to stack damage.\n\nElfin Stone's head snapped around. \"I'll deal with you first!\"\n\n\"...!\"\n\nFaker tensed. The vampire's attention had shifted from Huroi.\n\nPeeng!\n\nIyarugt pulsed crimson. \n\n> **[Blood Cry]**\n\nChiing!\n\nThe Overgeared members staggered, ears ringing, balance shattered. Elfin Stone seized the opening.\n\n\"Blood Thorns!\"\n\nPuuok! Puuok!\n\nCrimson spikes erupted from Blood Field, impaling Faker's thighs. The attack dealt minimal damage, but the thorns carried a vicious debuff. They corrupted the bloodstream, drastically reducing movement speed. Faker's greatest asset, his mobility, evaporated.\n\nElfin Stone smiled. Iyarugt rose, aimed at the assassin's neck. Flaming arrows intercepted the blade before it could descend.\n\nJishuka provided cover from range.\n\n\"Entertaining,\" Elfin Stone murmured. \"You humans show promise.\"\n\nThe longer this continued, the more the advantage tilted toward the vampire.\n\nKwajak!\n\nElfin Stone snapped an arrow with casual force. His health remained at eight-tenths. The Overgeared members had lost between one-third and half their health pools. Blood Field was grinding them down.\n\nZednos cast Blessing of the Wind on Faker, restoring his movement speed. \"At this rate, we're wiped in two minutes.\"\n\nVantner grunted agreement.\n\nElfin Stone's individual stats, attack power, magic power, defense, speed, weren't exceptional for a boss of his level. What made him overwhelming was utility. Area-of-effect drains. Wide-range offensive and defensive skills. Vampire racial abilities. Single-target defensive techniques. An endless toolkit.\n\nThey'd need the entire Overgeared Guild to have a chance. Could even a level 300 Grid defeat this monster alone?\n\nDoubt crept into their minds.\n\nThen Grid's whisper arrived.\n\n> **{Sacrifice Huroi. Elfin Stone's rampage is because of him. The vampire will stop after Huroi dies.}**\n\nWhat?\n\n\"...?\"\n\nEveryone except Huroi froze. Regas rolled away from Iyarugt's sweeping arc, his voice tight with disbelief.\n\n> **{Selling out our companion? Tell me I heard that wrong.}**\n\nGrid shook his head.\n\n> **{You heard correctly.}**\n\nPon's shout cracked with anger.\n\n> **{Don't make us lose faith in you!}**\n\nJishuka's response was ice.\n\n> **{A man who betrays his allies doesn't deserve to lead anyone.}**\n\nPeak Sword, Zednos, and Faker remained silent, but their discomfort radiated through the mental link. The criticism was warranted, natural even.\n\nGrid met their judgment without flinching. When he spoke, his voice carried absolute conviction.\n\n\"This is to protect the others.\"\n\nHe wasn't sacrificing Huroi arbitrarily.\n\n*One death saves eight lives.*\n\nMost people couldn't make that calculation, especially when the variable was someone they valued. Sentiment clouded logic. But Grid operated on ruthless pragmatism. Emotional decisions? Not his style. Never had been.\n\n\"Cough!\"\n\nAn attack hammered Faker. Grid surged forward and drew Failure.\n\nChaaeng!\n\nBlue orichalcum clashed against blood-red stone.\n\n> **[The durability of +9 Failure has decreased by 5.]**\n\nThe blood stone's hardness far exceeded blue orichalcum. Perhaps even surpassed adamantium.\n\n*Iyarugt's creator outclasses my current skill level.*\n\nGrid clicked his tongue and opened a private whisper to Huroi.\n\n> **—Do you understand what I'm asking? You need to die for everyone else.**\n\nHuroi's response came instantly.\n\n> **—I understand, My Lord.**\n\nNo hesitation. No protest. Grid's chest constricted.\n\n> **—Why don't you ever push back? It makes this worse, you being so goddamn obedient.**\n\n> **—I exist to follow your commands. When those orders are logical, like now, I'm even more willing.**\n\nThe death penalties were brutal. Experience loss. Item durability damage. Potential drops. For someone like Huroi, whose combat weakness made leveling agonizingly slow, the cost multiplied.\n\nYet he never balked.\n\n> **—I'll get revenge on Elfin Stone. And I'll compensate you enough to offset today's loss. You have my word.**\n\n> **—Compensation is unnecessary. Sacrificing myself for you and those you value is my purpose. I want nothing in return. Besides, this situation is my fault—**\n\n> **—You're not responsible. And don't forget, you're one of those precious people too.**\n\n> **—...**\n\nGrid steeled himself. He turned to Elfin Stone, who watched him with cold amusement over their crossed blades.\n\n\"I'll hand over the companion who insulted your parents.\" Grid's voice carried no emotion. \"Kill him. Satisfy your anger.\"\n\nElfin Stone's eyes widened fractionally.\n\n\"Selling out your ally to preserve your own life?\" A laugh, sharp and cruel. \"Humans truly are filthy, pathetic creatures.\"\n\n\"So you refuse?\"\n\nA smile split Elfin Stone's pale face.\n\n\"On the contrary. I accept.\"\n\n*Exactly as predicted.*\n\nElfin Stone wanted to prolong the hunt. Make the game last.\n\nGrid stepped back from the vampire. \"Go die.\"\n\nHuroi moved immediately. He sprinted toward Elfin Stone. The other members shouted.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"What are you doing, you insane—\"\n\nTheir protests meant nothing. Grid had decided. Huroi obeyed Grid.\n\n\"I'll make this exquisite.\"\n\nPuok!\n\nHuroi didn't resist as Elfin Stone toyed with him. Blood Thorns pierced his ankles, pinning him in place. Iyarugt slashed his wrists, severing tendons. Then the vampire began carving, treating Huroi's body like a butcher block. Methodical cuts. Precise mutilation.\n\nFinally, the blade cleaved into his skull.\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe pain simulation was dulled compared to reality, but the psychological trauma remained visceral. Huroi endured in absolute silence. His mind had been forged during hundreds of hours trapped in darkness. This was nothing.\n\n\"I can't watch this!\"\n\nThe Overgeared members trembled with righteous fury. Grid's voice cut through their building rage.\n\n\"Control yourselves and retreat. Now. Anyone who disobeys gets expelled from the guild.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nGrid had never possessed traditional charisma. His high Dignity stat meant nothing when he constantly undermined himself chasing gold and glory. He seemed frivolous. Weak.\n\nBut now, something had shifted. Guilt and sorrow warred behind his eyes. He forced the emotions down, burying them beneath iron composure. \n\nThe Overgeared members saw it. The weight he carried. The cost of command.\n\nThey retreated.\n\nOn that day, Huroi died.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms.**  \n**OG: Glossary Link.**  \n**Current schedule: 20 chapters a week.**\n\n**Check out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
