Two legends, two legacies intertwined in a location of profound importance to Satisfy's history. Which was precisely why Skunk's Expedition Group had become obsessed with it.\n\nUnraveling the Sword Grave's mysteries would eclipse even their discovery of the main Yatan Temple. Fame. Fortune. Everything they'd dreamed of. Skunk envisioned his own private jet. Dog Woman pictured cutting-edge medical facilities to save her dying brother. Crocodile fantasized about a garage housing a dozen supercars.\n\nA full year invested in this place.\n\nThen the uninvited guest arrived.\n\n\"G-Grid...!\"\n\nBlack-haired and crowned, the intruder possessed hawkish eyes and a muscular frame his armor and cloak couldn't quite conceal. The expedition members recognized him immediately—the floating name above his head confirmed their worst fears.\n\nGrid tilted his head. \"You are...?\"\n\nThe Sword Grave's existence should be unknown to anyone unconnected to Pagma's Successor, let alone its location. Finding people already here set off alarm bells.\n\nHis eyes narrowed. \"Were you following me?\"\n\n\"No. That would be impossible.\" Skunk answered quickly, mind racing. A year of work hung in the balance—he wouldn't antagonize Grid now. Leaders didn't survive by making stupid choices. \"This must be coincidence.\"\n\nHe forced his rigid facial muscles to relax, painting on his brightest smile. \"What an honor, meeting you here by chance. I'm Skunk, first-ranked explorer. A humble name, but... perhaps you've heard of it?\"\n\n\"Skunk? Ah.\" Memorable name—hard to forget something that made you think of farts. Grid recalled their previous encounter at the Yatan Temple, when Braham first used Assimilation. \"I remember. You discovered the main Yatan Church's location. Made quite a splash.\"\n\n\"I'm honored you remember.\" Skunk maintained his smile, but surprise rippled through him. Wasn't Grid supposed to be arrogant and belligerent in public? Why this polite demeanor in private, where no audience existed?\n\n'Can't be genuine kindness...'\n\nSkunk's thoughts darkened. Grid ruled a kingdom. His intelligence network operated on an entirely different level. With the right resources, Grid could easily have monitored their activities for months.\n\nThe conclusion hit like a punch. Grid must have been watching, waiting for them to excavate the Sword Grave's secrets on his behalf. Of course he'd pay attention—this place held special meaning. So he'd let them do all the work, then claim the prize...\n\n'He's being polite out of guilt for using us.'\n\nWhat a fool. Chasing anything Pagma-related without considering Grid might be watching. Thinking he could profit without understanding the game. His naivety was about to come due.\n\n\"...Um.\" Managing his expression grew harder. Guilt toward his colleagues warred with fear of those predatory eyes. But he gathered his courage and bowed deeply. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe apology carried layers. Sorry for trying to preempt Grid's quest. Sorry for the pretense of coincidence.\n\n\"Skunk! What are you doing?!\"\n\n\"Why apologize?!\"\n\nHis colleagues erupted in confusion. Dog Woman quickly understood and shushed the others. Grid, however, remained genuinely baffled.\n\n\"I don't know why you're apologizing.\"\n\nSkunk's heart plummeted. *He won't forgive me.*\n\nHe reconstructed his understanding of Grid. The ambitious man who'd married into Eternal nobility, accumulating enough power to devour the kingdom. Who'd installed Damian as pope and controlled him. Who'd used NPCs as shields during the Belial raid, then weaponized their deaths to annihilate Immortal. Who'd attempted Empire diplomacy while collecting powerful allies like Yura and Jishuka.\n\nVicious. Cunning. Ruthless. Brilliant.\n\nMercy from such a man seemed impossible.\n\n\"I see. So that's your answer.\"\n\nUnforgivable—daring to trespass in Pagma's grave.\n\n'I accept punishment. But my colleagues are different.' Skunk glanced at his team's nervous faces. 'I can't let them suffer for my mistake.'\n\nThey'd wasted a year. Would they lose their lives too? Unacceptable. He bit his lip, then raised his head.\n\nGrid said nothing. That silence demanded they choose their own punishment. Clearly, he viewed the expedition as insignificant—beneath him to pronounce judgment directly.\n\nSkunk spoke through a bitter smile. \"My colleagues discovered how to unlock the secrets here. They'd be valuable to you. Please—direct your anger at me alone. Show them mercy...\"\n\n\"Skunk! Shut up!\"\n\n\"Captain, why take responsibility alone?! There's only one Skunk Expedition Group!\"\n\nThe others finally understood and screamed protests.\n\n\"If Grid kills us, we die together!\"\n\n\"Damn it! I don't even know why we have to die!\"\n\n\"Captain! Stop shouldering everything alone!\"\n\nTheir agitated voices filled the clearing as they all turned toward Grid.\n\nHe had turned away. Staring at the stars. Silent.\n\n*I didn't see you today.*\n\n*I'm not seeing you now.*\n\n*Leave.*\n\n*Nothing happened.*\n\n*I'll forget.*\n\nThe unspoken message hung in the air. Something shifted in Skunk's chest. 'I completely misunderstood him.'\n\nOf course Grid had reason to hate them. They'd tried to rob his teacher's grave, planned to sell his legacy back at inflated prices. Yet Grid showed mercy, barely controlling anger that must burn inside...\n\n'His heart is vast as the ocean.'\n\nThe realization shook him. He'd analyzed Grid as wicked and self-serving. But Chris, Faker, Pon, Regas, Damian, Yura, Jishuka—powerhouses all. Would they follow Grid for years if he was truly ruthless?\n\n'They know the real Grid.'\n\nSkunk shivered and bowed again. \"Thank you. I'll never forget this.\"\n\nHe sent a friend request. \"Please whisper if you need help in the future. I'll answer.\" Parting words before departing. Grid never looked at them. Skunk glanced back several times—the Overgeared King remained motionless, studying the heavens.\n\n'A great person.'\n\n\"Overgeared King. The Overgeared Kingdom...\" A new home to consider.\n\n---\n\nGrid had completely forgotten the expedition existed. His senses focused entirely on the stars.\n\n> [An unknown light approached you but stopped.]\n\n> [The unknown light claims it never missed you.]\n\n> [The unknown light insists it has forgotten the days spent with you. Those days were insignificant and poor.]\n\n> [The unknown light doubts your quality—you are still weak.]\n\n> [The unknown light wanted to ask if you've been eating well but stopped.]\n\n> [The unknown light can't endure it.]\n\n—*You're still ugly.*\n\nThe voice in his mind felt achingly familiar. Grid had never forgotten it. Recognition sparked through him, and tears welled.\n\n\"Aren't you supposed to be a transcendent great magician? More like a dog magician.\" His face twisted.\n\nHe understood now. Why Braham had left earlier than planned. How long Braham had suffered after departing. The soul fragments revealed everything. His voice trembled. \"Really... I really wanted to see you, Braham.\"\n\nLaughing or crying? He couldn't tell. Grid smiled through tears as Braham's soul fragments shone quietly around him."
