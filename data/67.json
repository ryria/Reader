One of the five forbidden zones of the Eternal Kingdom. Terrible monsters. Monstrous terrain. High-level users died there without warning. He'd been there once before, back when he was a level 80 warrior doing Earl Ashur's quest, and the memory still made his stomach clench.\n\n*Going back at my current level is suicide.* \n\nBut leveling up the normal way would take weeks. Weeks he didn't have. His family's debt hung over him like a guillotine, and every hour spent grinding monsters was an hour he could have spent crafting items to sell.\n\nGrid stopped pacing and stared at the horizon. *Should I just postpone the damn quest? Make money instead?*\n\nNo. He knew himself too well. If he postponed it now, he'd keep finding excuses. The quest would rot in his log forever. Better to handle it while he still had the nerve.\n\n*There has to be a faster way.*\n\nThen it hit him.\n\nItem Creation.\n\nA grin split Grid's face. He turned and headed for the stairs, taking them two at a time down to the smithy floor.\n\n\"This is it. I'll use the Legendary Blacksmith's Creation skill.\"\n\nThe skill let Pagma's Descendant design items that didn't exist in Satisfy yet. Custom work. Exclusive work. The kind of thing that could solve problems a sword couldn't.\n\nGrid leaned against a workbench, thinking it through. *What do I actually need for Kesan Canyon?*\n\nThe canyon was a nightmare of geography. Deep ravines, brutal winds, steep slopes that chewed through stamina like a woodchipper. When he'd gone there as a warrior, exhaustion had nearly killed him before the monsters even showed up.\n\nBut that wasn't the real problem anymore.\n\n*My stamina's way higher now as a blacksmith.* Even at level 45, his stats were solid. He could handle the terrain. The monsters, though. That was different.\n\nThe monsters of Kesan Canyon started at level 160. They lurked in caves all over the area and attacked on sight. Even with his inflated stats, even with the Ideal Dagger, Grid wouldn't last five minutes in a straight fight.\n\n\"I need better gear. Something like the Sword of Self-transcendence, maybe some armor to match.\"\n\nHe considered it. Creating another legendary weapon wasn't impossible, but it would take time. Resources. Testing. And even then, he'd still be level 45 fighting level 160+ monsters. The numbers didn't work.\n\nGrid frowned. *Wait. Do I even need to fight them?*\n\nThe thought stopped him cold.\n\nHe wasn't going to Kesan Canyon to hunt. He was going to find Pagma's swordsmanship. Fighting monsters was a distraction, a waste of time and health potions. What he really needed was a way to *avoid* them entirely.\n\n\"An invisibility cloak.\"\n\nThe idea clicked into place like a puzzle piece. Invisibility cloaks existed in Satisfy. Two hundred years ago, the legendary tailor Kruger had made five of them. Two were still out there somewhere, worth astronomical sums because they made the wearer completely invisible.\n\nGrid straightened up, excitement building in his chest. \"If I can make one of those, Kesan Canyon's a joke. And I can sell it for a fortune afterward.\"\n\nHe spun on his heel and crossed the smithy floor. Khan was hunched over an anvil, hammer striking steel in a steady rhythm. Sweat dripped from his chin.\n\n\"Khan.\"\n\nThe old man stopped mid-swing and looked up. He wiped his forehead with the back of his hand.\n\n\"Are there materials for making stealth items?\" Grid asked.\n\nKhan set down his hammer and thought for a moment. \"Silver dragon scales.\"\n\n\"Silver dragon?\"\n\n\"They act cautiously. Stealthily. Their scales have a protective coloration that human eyes can't detect. If you made an item from them, you'd have an incredible stealth tool.\"\n\nGrid's excitement dimmed. \"How do you find scales you can't see? And anyway, aren't dragons the strongest creatures in the world? Getting their scales is basically impossible.\"\n\n\"For most people, yes.\" Khan smiled. \"But you're Pagma's Descendant.\"\n\nGrid didn't share the old man's optimism. He shifted tactics. \"What about the tailor Kruger? What did he use for his invisibility cloaks?\"\n\n\"I'm not certain,\" Khan admitted. \"But I believe he used sylphid scales.\"\n\n\"Sylphid?\"\n\n\"Small air fairies. Their scales work for stealth items, similar to dragon scales. The difference is that dragon scales are hard as minerals. Sylphid scales are thin, more like cloth. That's why Kruger used them. He was a tailor, not a blacksmith.\"\n\n\"Cloth.\"\n\nBlacksmiths worked with minerals and leather, not fabric. But Grid wasn't a normal blacksmith.\n\n*Will it work for me?*\n\nGrid took a breath and activated the skill. \"Legendary Blacksmith's Creation.\"\n\nA window materialized in front of him.\n\n> **[Legendary Blacksmith's Creation Skill]**\n> \n> You can create three equipment item production methods every time the skill level of the 'Legendary Blacksmith's Craftsmanship Skill' goes up.\n> \n> Number of items that can be created at present: 5/6.\n> \n> * When items are produced using this skill, the name of the creator is automatically placed on the item.\n\nAnother prompt appeared.\n\n> **[What item do you want to create?]**\n\nGrid hadn't touched this skill since making <span class=\"rarity-legendary\">Failure</span>. His hands were steady now.\n\n\"A cloak.\"\n\n> **[Have you decided?]**\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n> **[What materials would you like to use?]**\n\n\"Sylphid scales.\"\n\nIf the system couldn't handle cloth-based items, a warning would appear. Grid held his breath.\n\nNo warning came.\n\n> **[Have you decided?]**\n\nRelief washed over him. \"Yes.\"\n\n> **[Please design the item.]**\n\nA blank blueprint spread out before him like unrolled parchment. Grid had done this before with the greatsword. This time he knew what to expect.\n\n*Keep it simple. A cloak, but with a hood. Actually, no. Hoods make me think of priests, and priests are boring.*\n\nHe adjusted his mental image.\n\n*What if it's not a cloak at all? What if it's a hoodie? Something modern. Comfortable. A zip-up hoodie.*\n\nGrid began sketching. The system's correction effect smoothed out his lines, refining proportions and seams until the design looked professional. High-end, even. Like something a famous designer would make.\n\n\"I'd actually look good in this,\" Grid muttered. \"Women might even notice me for once.\"\n\nThen he remembered. *It's an invisibility cloak, you idiot. No one will see it.*\n\nGrumbling, he pressed the 'Finish' button at the bottom of the blueprint.\n\n> **[Have you decided? When you complete the blueprint, the number of available creation skills will decrease by one.]**\n\n\"Do it.\"\n\nThe blueprint came alive. Numbers and text scrolled across its surface as the system filled in details, adjusted measurements, calculated material requirements. After a few seconds, the finalized design appeared. Clean. Functional. Professional.\n\n> **[Please describe the characteristics of the item.]**\n\nThis was the critical part. With Failure, Grid had panicked and rambled. Not this time. He spoke clearly.\n\n\"The wearer can completely hide their appearance. No one can see me when I wear this.\"\n\n> **[Please name the item.]**\n\n\"Transparent Zip-up Hoodie.\" Grid paused. \"No, that's too long. Just call it Hooded Zip-Up.\"\n\nThe system didn't respond to his correction. Instead, a new prompt appeared.\n\n> **[Have you decided on 'Transparent Zip-up Hoodie um This is too Messy Let's just say Clean Hooded Zip-Up?']**\n\nGrid's eye twitched. \"Just call it the Hooded Zip-Up.\"\n\n> **[Have you decided on 'Hooded Zip-Up?']**\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA hologram materialized. The hoodie was white, sleek, with a modern cut. The item window unfolded beneath it.\n\n> **[<span class=\"rarity-unique\">Hooded Zip-Up</span>]**\n> \n> Rating: Unique  \n> Durability: 61/61  \n> Defense: 10\n> \n> * Movement speed will increase by 30%.  \n> * Wind resistance will increase by 20%.\n> \n> A cloak designed by a legendary blacksmith. However, the appearance is different from the normal look of a cloak.\n> \n> Thanks to the sylphid scales being used as the material, affinity with wind and movement speed will increase. You can hide while wearing it, but the stealth will be turned off when an enemy is attacked.\n> \n> Conditions of Use: None.  \n> Weight: 5\n\nGrid stared at the stats. His mouth went dry.\n\nHe'd only wanted the stealth function. But the system had added movement speed and wind resistance on top of it.\n\nA slow smile spread across his face. *This is going to make me rich.*"
