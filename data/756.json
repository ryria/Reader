  "content": "Most dungeons were hunting grounds—repositories of monsters waiting to be slaughtered for experience and loot. Few players cared where those monsters came from or why they existed. The origin didn't matter when gold was on the line.\n\n\"Chicken's not half bad.\"\n\nDark's blade carved through the cockatrice's neck. The creature shrieked, blood vessels bursting in its eyes as it thrashed—but not at him. Despite losing a tenth of its health in a single strike, the boss monster ignored its attacker entirely, driven deeper into the dungeon by something more primal than rage.\n\n*Which means no petrification.*\n\nDark watched the creature flee toward the dungeon's heart, safe from the devastating status effect that defined the cockatrice's threat. One of the deadliest debuffs in Satisfy, nullified by simple misdirection.\n\n\"Snake Dungeon was the right call.\"\n\nMost players treated dungeons as generic monster spawners. But every dungeon had a purpose—a design philosophy that dictated which creatures thrived within. Dark understood this better than most. After all, he'd built several himself.\n\n**[Snake Dungeon]**\n**Rating:** Epic\n**A dungeon created by Dungeon Maker Dark.**\n\n**Due to the abundant argandi trees planted throughout, ratmen and other rodents proliferate within. This ecosystem serves as an ideal habitat for snake-type monsters who prey upon them.**\n\nDark had originally constructed the Snake Dungeon as a diplomatic tool—building it near the Burangtang Clan's village to curry favor with the snake-worshipping tribe. The gesture had unlocked the hidden quest chain for the Burangtang's Treasure. Mission accomplished, dungeon moved on.\n\nBecause that was the beauty of his Dungeon Summoning skill. The ability only worked in 'occupied' spaces—caves, abandoned buildings, mountain hollows—but when triggered, it manifested his custom dungeons for a limited duration. Anywhere he needed them.\n\nAnd right now, he needed the Snake Dungeon in Reilt Canyon. Specifically because cockatrices—those grotesque hybrids of rooster and serpent—had a favorite delicacy.\n\nAmphisbaena.\n\n*Kieeeeek—!*\n\nThe boss monster's supernatural resilience closed the gash on its neck within moments. It resumed its frenzied dash, blind to everything except the scent of prey deeper in the dungeon. Dark's party might as well have been invisible.\n\n\"Bongsik, now!\"\n\n\"**Severe Cold Spear!**\"\n\nMa Bongshik thrust forward. One of Blood Carnival's four founding members, Bongsik had perfected the hybrid art of spell-enhanced melee combat. His magic spearman class allowed him to enchant weapons with elemental properties—and induce the insidious 'chill' status.\n\n*Clang!*\n\n*Screeeech—!*\n\nThe spear bit deep. Ice spread from the wound, and the cockatrice's movements turned sluggish. Chill wasn't as immediately devastating as frostbite or frozen—no dramatic ice sculptures or shattered limbs. But it ignored abnormal status resistance entirely, gradually sapping health and agility until the victim collapsed.\n\n\"Perfect! Keep it up!\"\n\nDark launched himself skyward as the cockatrice staggered. His battle power—amplified by the dungeon buff—rivaled Grid's strength before the Overgeared King had obtained his Enlightenment Sword.\n\n*Slash!*\n\nAnother tenth of the health bar vanished.\n\n*Kiik...! Kiiiiik!*\n\nThe cockatrice's eyes widened. Pain finally pierced its hunger-addled brain. Its gaze swung toward Dark—\n\n\"Uh-uh-uh! Boys, don't let it get distracted!\"\n\nViola twirled her staff, witch's hat bobbing with the motion. Another Blood Carnival founder, her conjurer class specialized in effect manipulation—strengthening buffs, extending status durations, and in this case, reinforcing mental compulsions.\n\nThe cockatrice's attention snapped back to the dungeon depths. It resumed its charge while Dark systematically butchered it.\n\n**『 W-What is going on here?! 』**\n\nThe commentators' confusion bled through the broadcast. Why was there a dungeon in Reilt Canyon? The subjugation expedition's official documentation from S.A. Group made no mention of such a structure. Why was the cockatrice obsessed with it? Why weren't the Korean players getting petrified?\n\nAnd more importantly...\n\n*They're strong.*\n\nThe Korean team was supposed to be nobodies—unknowns cobbled together from a nation lacking top-tier players. Yet they moved with practiced efficiency. Dark in particular was exceptional. The cockatrice was only a level 260 field boss, but its base defense was substantial. Among the fifteen hundred rankers competing in this National Competition, perhaps a handful could strip a tenth of its health with a single strike.\n\nDark did it *consistently.*\n\n\"**Waaahhh!**\"\n\n\"I don't know who this guy is, but he's incredible! Go Korea!\"\n\nWhile the commentators floundered for explanations, the crowd erupted. Nothing excited an audience like watching the script get shredded.\n\n***\n\n\"A dungeon?\"\n\nThe Russian team finally descended into the canyon. They entered the cave where the Korean players had taken shelter—and stopped.\n\n> **[You have entered Snake Dungeon.]**\n> **[You lack the creator's permission. The dungeon regards you as an intruder.]**\n\n\"Ah.\" Alexander nodded slowly, piecing it together. \"This dungeon is the true stage. The canyon was misdirection.\"\n\nIkonikoski's eyes lit up with understanding.\n\n\"That makes sense! We wasted time and stamina climbing while the objective was down here all along!\"\n\n\"Exactly. I should have realized sooner.\"\n\n\"Still, impressive that the Koreans figured it out immediately.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nAlexander hesitated. *Did they figure it out, though?*\n\nDark, Viola, Ma Bongshik. The Korean representatives were complete unknowns—players he'd never heard of in his career. Given South Korea's shallow talent pool at the top levels, Alexander was confident these three ranked among the weakest of the fifteen hundred competitors present.\n\n\"They got lucky,\" he decided. \"The cockatrice wandered toward their hiding spot. Right place, right time.\"\n\nPathetic, really. Winning through circumstances rather than skill.\n\n\"We intercept. Even bottom-tier players can kill the cockatrice with enough time. We can't give them that opportunity.\"\n\nThree minutes had elapsed since the cockatrice entered the dungeon. The opening petrification wave should be resolving right about now, giving the Koreans their window to counterattack.\n\n*They'll be chipping away at its health... maybe down to a thirtieth by now. Not insurmountable.*\n\nNo point in taking chances. Alexander lit a torch and charged deeper, his team following. The dungeon sprawled larger than expected. Snake-type monsters emerged periodically—but they were only level 100. Barely a nuisance.\n\n*Strange.*\n\nAlexander's instincts prickled. Level 100 monsters had no business appearing in a National Competition event. Combined with that warning message about the creator's permission...\n\n*This is a separate space. Something's wrong here.*\n\nBut there was no concrete evidence to act on, and the alternative was abandoning the hunt entirely. The Russians pressed forward until they reached the dungeon's heart.\n\nWhere they saw—\n\n*Kyaak—!*\n\nThe cockatrice's head toppled from its shoulders.\n\n\"*What?!*\"\n\nSeven minutes. **Seven minutes** since the boss had entered the dungeon. Yet the cockatrice was already dead—butchered by Korea's unknown team.\n\n\"W-Who the hell are you people?!\"\n\nAlexander's voice cracked. Dark didn't even look up as he looted the corpse.\n\n\"The gold medal favorites.\"\n\n***\n\n\"To the cave!\"\n\nSouth Korea's upset victory against Russia sent shockwaves through the competition. In subsequent Group A matches, every team sprinted for the canyon entrance at the starting gun. Everyone now knew the cockatrice would descend to that location.\n\nExcept...\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"...????\"\n\nThe cockatrice didn't move. It remained at the canyon's peak, waiting for challengers to climb. Game after game, the pattern held consistent.\n\nApart from South Korea's match, the cockatrice never descended.\n\n*What the hell is happening?*\n\nCommentators, spectators, participants, viewers—everyone searched for explanations that didn't exist. The cockatrice's behavior defied established patterns, responding to some variable unique to the Korean team. The mystery remained unsolved as the tournament progressed.\n\nUntil the quarterfinals. Where South Korea drew a bracket with the United States and Canada.\n\nNobody pitied South Korea for facing two tournament favorites in the same group. Not after watching them dismantle the cockatrice in seven minutes flat.\n\n*This is going to be tricky.*\n\nCloud, the US representative, grimaced. America had failed to secure gold in any of the four previous team events. The subjugation expedition was their last viable opportunity—but now they faced Canada, who'd claimed three golds already, and South Korea, whose power level remained an unknown quantity.\n\n*If we lose here, we don't even medal.*\n\nThe American team needed an edge. The solution came quickly.\n\n\"We keep the Koreans away from the cave.\"\n\nThe cockatrice's anomalous behavior was clearly linked to the Korean team accessing that specific location. The mechanism was unclear, but preventing them from reaching it eliminated the variable entirely.\n\nAt the starting signal, the US team sprinted toward Korea's spawn position. Canada made the same calculation simultaneously—both teams converging on the Korean players.\n\n**『 South Korea is under immediate assault! 』**\n\nThe gambit made tactical sense. South Korea's unexpected strength made them a target worth eliminating. As commentators speculated about Korea's survival, the targeted team remained remarkably calm.\n\nNo—they looked *pleased.*\n\n\"Cloud and Henry... now *this* is a proper debut. At least they're worth fighting.\"\n\n\"Better than some Russian nobody.\"\n\n\"Guess we're hunting people instead of chickens.\"\n\nThe American and Canadian teams had committed their best. Six players from the unified rankings' top 500—proof both nations took this event seriously. With the overall medal count still competitive, they'd invested their strongest pieces.\n\nBut South Korea had invested **more.**\n\nDark wasn't ranked because rankings were **meaningless** to a Sun-grade powerhouse. He operated at Grid's level—the absolute peak of player capability. Top 500 rankers were children playing with wooden swords compared to him.\n\n*Thud!*\n\n*Slash—slash—slash!*\n\nWithout activating a single special ability, Dark's party annihilated the American and Canadian representatives through raw combat superiority. Both nations were eliminated without claiming bronze.\n\nSouth Korea took gold.\n\nBy day's end, Dark dominated search engine rankings across every Korean portal site. Sales of spicy jokbal surged nationwide—though ironically, the actual restaurant Dark operated in Haenam was closed for the holiday."
