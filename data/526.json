Yet three years after the game's launch, only one proven route existed: the Behen Archipelago.\n\nIt was no simple crossing.\n\nOf Satisfy's two billion players, a mere thirty had successfully navigated the archipelago to reach the East Continent. The single-player instant dungeon proved so brutal that reaching even the tenth island was considered an achievement worthy of pride.\n\nThose who made the journey were exceptional—though a fortunate few had stumbled upon Fog Island early and slipped through without the grueling trial.\n\n---\n\n*I was the strongest on the West Continent.*\n\n*Who could've imagined I wouldn't even escape the starter village?*\n\n*Damn my luck. If I'd known what this place was like, I would've never come.*\n\n*I thought meeting Fog Island early was fortune smiling on me...*\n\nA shabby tavern on Pangea's North Street hosted four dejected figures hunched over their drinks. All were players—**Level 310** \"beginners\" who'd arrived on the East Continent a month ago but remained trapped in Pangea.\n\n\"That damn Kraugel,\" one muttered, taking a long pull from his mug.\n\nThey'd rushed to the East Continent with grand ambitions. Not merely to level, but to monopolize new content—titles, skills, hidden items. All the advantages of being first.\n\nBut when they'd arrived, Pangea already lay in Kraugel's wake. The starter village had been thoroughly plundered, triggering a new episode that exponentially raised the difficulty.\n\n\"The scenario's clear as day,\" Lane said bitterly. \"A player arrives from the West Continent. Pangea faces crisis. That player becomes a hero by repelling the monster invasion.\" He slammed his mug on the table. \"First one gets everything. Kraugel reaped all the benefits while we're stuck chasing scraps.\"\n\n*How rotten,* Mook thought. *A month here, and I haven't seen a single special quest. Kraugel hoarded them all.*\n\n*We should leave Pangea for new territory, but...*\n\nThe monsters to the north had been growing steadily since their defeat at Kraugel's hands. They'd become too powerful.\n\n*Our skills aren't enough to push north...*\n\n*That bastard Kraugel.*\n\nThey couldn't achieve their original purpose. Kraugel had cleared most hidden quests, and the environment had grown hostile. Moving to a new area was the only solution—except it was impossible. The northern route was blocked by powerful creatures the players had nicknamed \"hamsters.\"\n\n\"At least the neighborhood errands and local monster hunts provide decent experience,\" Evan offered.\n\n\"True. We're definitely stronger than when we arrived,\" Oshihoz agreed. \"Probably stronger than those Seven Guilds losers or Overgeared's so-called rankers.\"\n\n\"The East Continent's been good for growth,\" Lane admitted. \"But we'll die if we face the Queen Rat directly. We can't take her.\"\n\n\"Then we don't fight her,\" Mook said, leaning forward. \"We use the next newcomer as bait. While the Queen Rat's distracted, we break through to the north.\"\n\nThe past month hadn't been wasted. Through countless mundane quests, they'd uncovered the Queen Rat's weakness: <span class=\"rare-gold\">Golden Walnuts</span>.\n\n\"Did you get the promised amount?\" Lane asked.\n\n\"Ten,\" Mook confirmed.\n\n\"That's forty total. Should be enough.\"\n\n\"I went broke buying these things,\" Evan grumbled.\n\n\"Same,\" Oshihoz said, shaking his head.\n\nAs their name suggested, <span class=\"rare-gold\">Golden Walnuts</span> gleamed like treasure. Despite tasting identical to ordinary walnuts, their effects were extraordinary:\n\n> **All stats +10% for 1 hour**  \n> **Average chance to permanently increase one stat by 5 points**\n\nThey functioned as both supreme buff potion and half-elixir—a prize any player would covet.\n\nBut the price reflected their rarity: **160,000 gold** each. In real currency, over two million won per walnut. The limited supply and noble patronage across East Continent kingdoms drove costs through the ceiling.\n\nUnless wealthy or gambling-addicted, no rational player would purchase them.\n\n\"Giving such expensive items to a *monster*,\" Mook said with a pained expression.\n\n\"Consider it an investment,\" Lane said firmly. \"Anyone who escaped Pangea clearly used these walnuts.\"\n\n\"Exactly. If we break through to untapped territory, we'll find our land of gold. One good item, title, or skill makes it worthwhile. Once we're stronger, we return to the West Continent and rake in the profit.\"\n\nAnticipation coursed through the group.\n\nThen someone approached their table.\n\n\"Excuse me? Are you players?\"\n\nA black-haired man with a sturdy build—approximately 181 centimeters tall, with broad shoulders, a flat chest, and well-defined muscles. An ideal physique. Obviously another player, though his ID remained hidden behind a black mask covering half his face.\n\n*This must be the newcomer,* Lane thought.\n\n*The target walked right to us. This is too easy.*\n\nThey kept their excitement hidden, greeting him with manufactured politeness.\n\n\"What a surprise! We didn't expect to meet another player from the West Continent out here.\"\n\n\"You made it all the way to the East Continent, so you must be high level. Pleasure to meet you.\"\n\n\"But what's with the mask?\"\n\n\"Is it decorative? Looks intimidating, but doesn't it block your vision...?\"\n\nThe masked man scratched his head awkwardly.\n\n\"I was accused of molestation by the guards and had to run. I'll need to wear this for a while. Sorry, but could you pretend we're traveling together? Just until things cool down.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\nA molester? Introducing himself as such right away? The four players exchanged bewildered glances.\n\n*I've heard rumors about players who harass NPCs, but I never thought I'd actually meet such trash.*\n\n---\n\nThe man behind the bizarre laughing mask was currently livid. After giving Yang Fei a massage outside Idan's restaurant, he'd been chased by guards while heading to the smithy—falsely accused of publicly harassing women.\n\n*What the hell?*\n\nGrid's legendary dexterity proved useful in many situations, but the risk was equally great. He made a mental note to restrain his hands in public. He'd dodged the guards by ducking into the tavern, where he'd encountered four players.\n\n*Lane, Mook, Evan, and Oshihoz.*\n\nStrange. They'd crossed to the East Continent, which meant they were at least third advancement. Yet their IDs and faces were unfamiliar—unofficial rankers, most likely.\n\n*Met them by chance, but I should gather information.*\n\nThe old Grid would've tried to exploit them. The current Grid could manage moderately decent human relations like a normal person.\n\n\"Do you know any good hunting grounds?\" he asked, gesturing to the bar. \"Let me buy you a round. We can exchange information.\"\n\nThe four players' eyes gleamed. The prey had approached voluntarily.\n\n*Shame we don't know his identity yet.*\n\nPerhaps he'd concealed it from the start, already on guard. They suppressed their curiosity, focusing on ensnaring the masked stranger.\n\n\"We got a huge jackpot today, actually.\"\n\n\"Ever since arriving on the East Continent, it's been heaven. Money and experience just pour in.\"\n\n\"We know plenty of good hunting grounds. Though as a skilled player who made it here, you probably already know where to look.\"\n\nBehind his mask, Grid's eyes lit up.\n\n*Excellent hunting grounds!*\n\nLeveling was Grid's primary goal on the East Continent. These words grabbed his full attention.\n\n*I've been here less than three days. I don't know much...*\n\nIf they discovered the truth, they might refuse him. Grid bluffed, unwilling to expose his current situation. He needed to maintain the dignity befitting Overgeared's leader.\n\n\"Of course I know a few good spots. Want to share information?\"\n\n*What could he possibly know?*\n\nThe players knew when this masked newcomer had arrived. The fool was trying to deceive his deceivers.\n\n\"Sure, why not? Benefits both of us. Players in a strange land should help each other out.\"\n\n\"Exactly. The hunting grounds are vast—one more person won't hurt.\"\n\nThey smiled widely at Grid.\n\n\"We just finished eating. We'd be happy to lead you to a hunting ground right now.\"\n\nGrid accepted readily. \"Sounds good. Afterward, I'll share what I know about hunting spots.\"\n\nThe players exchanged wicked grins. They left the tavern and headed north toward the Big Poisonous Rat community.\n\nGrid's internal alarm bells rang.\n\n*Wait. This is the 'good' hunting ground?*\n\nCertainly, the Big Poisonous Rat community qualified as \"good\"—but not after the Queen Rat's death. The respawned rats were significantly weaker, their average level dropped by thirty, yielding reduced experience.\n\n*I wanted somewhere other than here.*\n\nGrid clicked his tongue in disappointment.\n\nMeanwhile, the four players' thoughts raced:\n\n*Huh? What happened?*\n\n*Why are the rats so weak?*\n\n*This is strange. Something changed with them, but the Queen Rat should still be strong. Did we apply the illusion magic to the walnuts correctly?*\n\n*Yes. No way he can tell these are Golden Walnuts. Even a top-grade appraisal item will only show ordinary walnuts.*\n\nFinding a newcomer to serve as bait was fortunate. The players believed their plan would succeed flawlessly.\n\nIt was, of course, a misunderstanding.\n\nOne that would likely work in Grid's favor."
