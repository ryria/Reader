  "content": "**Pangea's Duke of Virtue.**\n\n*If someone doesn't know the title, they'd probably read it as 'Pan Deokin'!* Grid thought wryly. The Korean characters could pass for a person's name.\n\nBeing misunderstood wasn't the problem—the name \"Pan Deokin\" was fine, if a bit ordinary. No, the real issue was the title's effect.\n\n*A chance to spare monsters while hunting?*\n\nWhat about the experience? The money? The loot!\n\n*Especially during a boss fight...*\n\nImagine pouring dozens of minutes—or even hours—into a raid, victory finally within reach, when suddenly—\n\n> **[The effect of the title 'Pangea's Duke of Virtue' has been activated!]**\n\nThat notification window appearing.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nJust imagining it made him queasy. Grid's stomach cramped at the thought. He took the title's effect at face value, never considering possibilities like building favorable relationships with spared monsters or unlocking tamer class skills. For Grid, such speculation was pointless.\n\nWhy? Because Grid was already an all-rounder—blacksmith, swordsman, magician, skeleton summoner. Adding yet another class seemed not only unlikely but undesirable.\n\n\"Ah, shi...\"\n\nHe'd handed over the **Red Phoenix Bow** and earned 80 affinity points. Was *this* garbage title his reward? Grid simmered with frustration until Han Seokbong extended his hand, offering a bead.\n\nA red bead.\n\nBeautiful, like Braham's eyes. At first glance, Grid mistook it for a polished ruby, but then he noticed something—\n\n\"Flames?\"\n\nInside the translucent crimson sphere, a small flame flickered. Tiny as a match's flame, yet radiating tremendous intensity. As if life itself burned within. Grid examined it more closely. \"A torch?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nAny player would've appreciated Grid's observation. But NPCs didn't know what a torch was.\n\n\"What is a torch?\" White and Han Seokbong asked simultaneously, heads tilting in confusion.\n\nGrid waved off the question. \"Then this torch... No, what *is* this bead?\"\n\n\"The fire in the bead...\" White began, studying the beautiful sphere and searching for a name. *It's like the picture...*\n\nHan Seokbong cut in. \"It's the Red Phoenix's Breath.\"\n\n\"Breath?\"\n\n\"Yes. The breath that drops when the four divine guardians pass by to bless those ascending to daoist immortality.\"\n\n*Divine guardians... Daoist immortal.*\n\nKey concepts for the East Continent. The Hwan Kingdom, national treasures, yangbans, divine guardians—all clearly influenced by Korean and Chinese culture.\n\n*Which means there will definitely be areas influenced by Japanese culture, too.*\n\nPeak Sword would throw a fit if he were here. He'd probably demand to know why the Korean S.A. Group was promoting foreign cultures worldwide.\n\nGrid smiled, thinking of the friend he hadn't seen in a while. A notification window materialized before him.\n\n> **[You have obtained 'Red Phoenix Breath' as a reward for the quest 'Win the Smithy Competition!']**\n\n*Legendary Blacksmith's Appraisal.*\n\nTtiring~\n\n> **[Red Phoenix's Breath]**\n> \n> **A blessing of the Red Phoenix.**\n> \n> **Increases fire resistance by 30%.**\n> \n> **Can be used to infuse items with the powerful aura of the Red Phoenix. However, it can only be attached to items with a strong fire attribute.**\n> \n> **Weight: 2**\n\n\"Hah.\"\n\nSo the **Pangea's Duke of Virtue** title wasn't the only reward. *This* was the true compensation for creating the Red Phoenix Bow.\n\n\"If I use this, will it become the real Red Phoenix Bow?\" Grid asked.\n\nHan Seokbong nodded. \"That's right. It's the energy of fire that won't die forever. There is no stronger fire energy.\"\n\n*Amazing!*\n\nTruly amazing. Grid couldn't imagine how powerful the bow would become when harmonized with the white phosphorus wood.\n\n*This is a reward worthy of a legendary rated item!*\n\nWasn't it possible to upgrade the Red Phoenix Bow to **myth rating** if he combined it with the Red Phoenix Breath? Grid's face lit up with delight, and Han Seokbong smiled at the reaction.\n\nPangea possessed a total of three Red Phoenix Breaths. One belonged to the original Red Phoenix Bow—the stolen one—leaving only two. This shouldn't have been given to Grid. If the Red Phoenix Bow were ever lost again, restoring it might prove impossible.\n\nHowever, Han Seokbong knew how to repay favors. The Red Phoenix Bow Grid created surpassed the original in value, so rewarding him with the most precious treasure was only fitting.\n\n*I won't repeat the same mistakes.* Han Seokbong vowed silently. He wouldn't allow the Red Phoenix Bow to be lost again.\n\nGrid pocketed the treasure and asked, \"By the way, where is the castle's dungeon?\"\n\nHan Seokbong laughed. \"You can enter it through a well in the west of the castle.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nArmored Needles! Silver thread! A new hunting ground. Grid's fantasy about the dungeon—one only accessible to a select few—soared to grandiose heights. He was so excited he wanted to sprint forward immediately, but Han Seokbong raised a hand.\n\n\"It's true you have the right to enter the castle's dungeon. However, you can't access it arbitrarily anymore.\"\n\n\"Eh? I have access rights, but I can't freely use them?\"\n\n\"This is for your safety. You can only enter with a full guard escort.\"\n\n\"Guards?\"\n\nHan Seokbong glanced at White, his expression turning bitter. \"Years ago, Pangea suffered a terrible incident and lost a great blacksmith. Dawhite... Boss White's father.\"\n\nWhite stiffened at the mention.\n\n\"Dawhite won the championship and gained entrance to the castle's dungeon. He was murdered by an Armored Needle.\" Han Seokbong's voice was heavy. \"The lord realized then that he couldn't completely protect the weak.\"\n\n\"Anyone who enters the castle's dungeon must be fully equipped to protect themselves,\" Han Seokbong continued. \"You can only enter if you have a minimum of six silver or gold class mercenaries as escorts.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nMercenaries meant those who moved only for money. But Grid was **Pagma's Descendant**, not an ordinary blacksmith. He possessed power—he didn't want to waste gold hiring mercenaries. There was no reason to do so.\n\n\"I have enough strength to protect myself.\"\n\n\"Everyone says that,\" Han Seokbong replied dryly.\n\n\"No, I'm serious.\"\n\n\"Hrmm...\" Han Seokbong looked Grid up and down. Grid wore worn-out clothing—he projected a certain unknown dignity but seemed vulnerable when it came to defense. \"In your current state, you'll die if you're merely scratched by an Armored Needle or silver thread.\"\n\n\"Then what about this?\"\n\n*Clink!*\n\n*Clink clink!*\n\nAs always, Grid was dressed in beginner's clothing. Now he retrieved **Triple Layers** from his inventory. His body was armed in an instant, and Han Seokbong and White's eyes widened.\n\n*A blacksmith can wear such heavy armor?*\n\n*Yes, a person of distinction... He has the strength and stamina of the greatest blacksmiths.*\n\nDue to the nature of the profession, **Strength** and **Stamina** were paramount for blacksmithing. A top blacksmith might possess as much physical power as a knight. Grid wearing such heavy armor wasn't unrealistic. Still, Han Seokbong remained concerned.\n\n\"Just because you can wear armor with high strength and stamina doesn't mean you have the skills to utilize it properly,\" Han Seokbong said. \"You won't be able to bring out the armor's full potential.\"\n\nThe absence of **Heavy Armor Mastery**—in other words, the penalty—was being pointed out. Those who wore heavy armor without the mastery skill couldn't even apply half the armor's effectiveness.\n\nGrid spoke confidently to the worried Han Seokbong. \"I'll be fine.\"\n\n**Pagma's Descendant** was technically classified as a non-combat profession. The passive effect of **Pagma's Swordsmanship** functioned similarly to Sword Mastery, but he possessed no armor mastery skills. A fatal drawback—except Grid didn't suffer penalties when wearing items. In other words, he couldn't bring out 101% of the armor's effectiveness, but he could extract the full 100%.\n\n*Most people are too confident and take needless risks. That is the nature of distinguished individuals,* Han Seokbong thought bitterly, reminded of Dawhite in the moments before his death. He pulled out a trump card.\n\n\"Then prove it.\"\n\n\"Prove?\"\n\n\"Yes. There's a gatekeeper at the dungeon entrance. He has attack power similar to the Armored Needles. Try to endure one of his blows.\"\n\nOf course, he'd instruct the gatekeeper to adjust his power. If the gatekeeper used his full force, Grid would die.\n\n*I'll command him to use 30% of his power... That should be enough to avoid killing him.* Grid would merely faint for a few days. With that thought, Han Seokbong guided Grid and White to the castle dungeon entrance.\n\nWhite's complexion was ashen as he followed. Like Grid, White was in a position to access the dungeon.\n\n*I want to avenge my father and earn some silver thread...* But it was impossible for him to even enter! He felt deeply ashamed.\n\nGrid placed a hand on White's shoulder. \"The Mass Production Grid Set... It's good armor you can wear with your current level and strength. How about it? Want to borrow it?\"\n\n\"Hah. C-Can I really?\"\n\nWhite trusted Grid completely. Grid smiled without hesitation.\n\n\"The hourly rental fee is 500 gold. Deal?\"\n\nIn fact, Grid had wanted to charge more. However, it was hard to act so cruelly toward White.\n\n\"I'll offer up everything I own if I can pass the gatekeeper's trial,\" White said fervently.\n\nThe deal was struck. Satisfied, Grid opened his inventory and retrieved a **Mass Production Grid Set** tucked in a corner. A Grid Set with **unique rating** that had been enhanced to **+7**—the same set worn by Reidan's young knight, Royman.\n\n*That woman... Is she growing well?* He wasn't thinking about her chest. He meant her skills as a knight. Royman was a talent handpicked and trained by Piaro. Grid's expectations for her were high.\n\n***\n\nA few minutes after Grid and White concluded their deal, the party reached the well in the west of the castle—the dungeon entrance. A two-meter-tall man stood guard beside it.\n\n\"You must experience being hit by this man who can crush rocks into powder,\" Han Seokbong said, giving Grid one last chance to reconsider. \"Do you have to go through with it?\"\n\n\"Hit me. I'll be okay.\"\n\nGrid paused. \"Ah, by the way—\"\n\nHe turned to White. \"You might get hurt. This gatekeeper isn't normal.\"\n\n\"...Huh?\"\n\nWhite paled but clung to his faith in the armor Grid had lent him.\n\nMeanwhile, someone watched them with an unpleasant expression—the daughter of Han Seokbong, a knight belonging to the castle dungeon exploration team."
