Ttang...*\n\nGrid had finished his maintenance work ten minutes ago, his usual equipment now perfectly restored. Yet his hammer continued its steady rhythm. He wouldn't dream of disturbing Picasso, who stood motionless before her canvas, utterly transfixed by the process of capturing his image. The intensity in her gaze—unblinking, completely absorbed—spoke of true artistic devotion. Grid found himself respecting that dedication.\n\n*What to do while she finishes?*\n\nHe certainly wasn't going to craft underwear for posterity's sake. Mass-produced Grid Sets, perhaps? As he mulled over his options, his thoughts drifted to the First Holy Sword. After countless cycles of disassembly and reconstruction in his attempts to break its curse, his understanding had reached sixty percent.\n\nPerfect reproduction remained impossible, but a partial recreation? That was within reach.\n\n*A smaller version would show me the sword's true capabilities.*\n\nWith luck, the attempt might even deepen his understanding further. Grid's gaze wandered to the mineral storage along the smithy's wall.\n\n\"What materials do you need, sir?\" \n\nA young blacksmith had already noticed his attention and hurried forward.\n\nGrid grimaced internally. *This feels like I'm the school bully demanding lunch money.*\n\nThe deference was unsettling. They anticipated his every need before he voiced it, reading his desires like an open book. And it stemmed not from fear of his power, but from genuine respect and goodwill.\n\n\"Iron ore and mithril.\"\n\n\"Right away!\" The apprentice practically sprinted to the warehouse.\n\nMoments later, the young man returned laden with ore. Grid fed iron into his pre-heated furnace, considering his materials.\n\n*Of course, nothing compares to the divine stone Hexetia himself created.*\n\nAmong earthly minerals, few could channel divine power as effectively as mithril. His plan was straightforward: minimize the iron ore, maximize the mithril. That balance should allow some measure of divine power to flow through the blade.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nHe cycled through the familiar sequence—smelting, tempering, quenching. Under his methodical work, formless stone gradually took shape, becoming steel, becoming blade.\n\n*I can see it perfectly! The First Holy Sword's true form!*\n\n*Ttang!*\n\nGrid slipped into the deep focus of a trance state, his mind reaching back to when he'd first encountered the holy sword in the hands of Yatan's Servants. Every detail surfaced with crystalline clarity: the divine stone's properties, the blade's storied history, the intentions woven into its very essence. He poured it all into his reproduction.\n\n*Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!*\n\nThe result wasn't flawless, but the soul of the original remained intact. The sword taking shape on his anvil bore striking resemblance to its legendary counterpart. Yet something was wrong.\n\n*The divine power...*\n\nThat was the missing piece. His reproduction captured the form, but the divine energy running through it was a pale shadow of the original. Inevitable, really—mithril had its limits. Its greatest quality was accepting divine power, not generating it. Like his work on the Divine Shield in the past, he needed a Rebecca Church priest to properly infuse the blade with sanctity.\n\n*What a blunder!*\n\nThis wasn't a holy sword at all. He'd overlooked a fundamental aspect of its essence.\n\n*I'm an idiot.*\n\nDisappointment washed over him. How could he have forgotten to secure priestly assistance? But perhaps he was being too harsh on himself. Anyone might make this oversight. So focused on capturing the sword's intent and appearance, he'd simply missed a crucial component.\n\n*...Breathe. Stay calm.*\n\nGrid set down his hammer and drew a long breath, centering himself. The half-finished blade gleamed on the anvil, but there was no reason to panic.\n\n*I can request temple support later.*\n\nEven if the priests claimed to be short-staffed, he'd have other chances to attempt this recreation. No need to despair over a single setback.\n\n*...Hold on.*\n\nAs his anxiety dissipated, his mind cleared. New possibilities emerged. Grid's eyes widened as realization struck.\n\n*The iron ore magic training method!*\n\nThat technique allowed him to temper minerals through sustained magical bombardment. The training speed depended on the caster's power and skill level. Traditionally, the method's glacial pace made it prohibitively challenging.\n\n*But I have the elemental now!*\n\nThat was the crucial insight—the advanced light elemental changed everything.\n\n*Can I use the elemental to train minerals?*\n\nHe pulled up the elemental's detailed information.\n\n---\n\n> **[Light Elemental (Advanced)]**\n>\n> You can command the advanced light elemental.\n>\n> Current elemental level: 1\n>\n> **Available Elemental Techniques:**\n>\n> * The advanced elemental possesses infinite energy. It requires no resources from its contractor.\n>\n> **[Sword of Light]**\n>\n> Transforms the elemental into a sword of light.\n>\n> The elemental will follow its contract, illuminating darkness for the contractor. Upon detecting enemies with darkness attributes, it will attack autonomously.\n>\n> The Sword of Light's attack power scales with the contractor's **physical attack power** and **magic attack power**.\n>\n> * This skill maintains indefinitely. However, other techniques cannot be used while in Sword of Light state.\n>\n> **[Flash]**\n>\n> The light elemental instantaneously relocates to any target designated by the contractor.\n>\n> If targeting an enemy, the elemental emits intense radiance, inflicting 0.3 seconds of blindness. This effect cannot be resisted.\n>\n> If targeting an ally, the elemental bestows a single-use **dark attack resistance** buff.\n>\n> Cooldown: 5 minutes.\n\n---\n\n*Perfect! I can use Sword of Light to repeatedly strike the blade!*\n\nThe Magic Battle Gear Production Method had always been too labor-intensive for regular use. When he'd last employed it, training ore with Magic Missile had consumed a full two weeks. Despite using mana potions liberally, his stamina had plummeted, leaving him physically and mentally drained.\n\nEven for someone who practically worshipped hard work, the Magic Battle Gear Production Method pushed beyond reasonable limits. But now?\n\n*The elemental changes everything!*\n\nThe elemental would cast the magic. The elemental possessed infinite energy.\n\n*I'll remelt the blade and have Sword of Light strike it ten thousand times.*\n\nThe divine power infusion would perfect the sword's completeness. The Magic Battle Gear Production Method's proficiency would likely increase. And Grid wouldn't expend a single drop of stamina!\n\n\"Kukukuk! Puhahahaha!\"\n\nWhat kind of fool was he? A genius, that's what! The sheer brilliance of utilizing the advanced light elemental this way left him giddy with excitement. Without hesitation, Grid set his plan in motion. He returned the half-formed blade to molten state and commanded the light elemental to begin mineral training.\n\nThe elemental's trials began immediately. A white blade of pure light materialized and struck the molten metal on the anvil in an endless rhythm. Grid folded his arms and observed.\n\n\"What in the world...?\" \n\nThe young blacksmiths gaped at the spectacle, whispering among themselves. They turned to their seniors, seeking explanation for Grid's unprecedented technique. But who could answer? Even the master craftsmen stood mute, witnessing something entirely new—a blacksmith wielding an elemental in their craft.\n\nThey could only watch in reverent silence, unable to imagine what would emerge from this process.\n\n\"...\"\n\nPicasso applied the final strokes to her canvas. The painting was complete.\n\nAgainst a background of blazing crimson, a crowned figure wielded his hammer while dozens of blacksmiths bore witness. A radiant light elemental wreathed the central figure in brilliance.\n\n*What will the system judge this?*\n\nPicasso's soul burned with anticipation as she focused on her finished work. She swallowed hard, waiting for the rating. She'd poured everything into this piece—the result exceeded even her own expectations—but would the system agree? \n\nThe answer came swiftly.\n\n---\n\n> **[You have completed a new work!]**\n>\n> **[The birth of a masterpiece that perfectly captures the legendary blacksmith, king, and Hero King who commands the awe of blacksmiths across the world!]**\n>\n> **[The first extremely honorable painting created in 177 years.]**\n>\n> **[You deserve recognition for immortalizing the greatest figure of this age for future generations!]**\n>\n> **[All stats increased by 20 points for completing a masterpiece.]**\n>\n> **[All stats increased by 50 points for completing an extremely honorable painting.]**\n>\n> **[All class-related skills increased by 1 level!]**\n>\n> **[Class quest 'Painter who will go down in History' has been generated!]**\n>\n> **[The subject of the extremely honorable painting will feel deep gratitude toward you.]**\n\n---\n\n*Extremely honorable painting?*\n\nPicasso stared at the notifications, confused by this unintended and unexpected classification.\n\n---\n\n> **[You have become the subject of an extremely honorable painting. Your appearance and achievements will be preserved for future generations unless this painting is destroyed.]**\n>\n> **[Your current stats are engraved within the extremely honorable painting. Regardless of what befalls you, you may recover the strength stored within by recalling the identity preserved there. This opportunity may only be used once.]**\n\n---\n\n\"...What?\" Grid's mind filled with questions.\n\nPicasso turned to him, her voice warm with sincerity. \"Even the system acknowledges you as the finest of your generation.\" It wasn't empty flattery or baseless speculation. She expressed profound gratitude: \"Thank you for allowing me to paint you. This honor will stay with me forever. I'll continue serving the Overgeared Kingdom and repay this debt.\"\n\n\"...Excuse me?\"\n\nGrid retracted his earlier self-assessment. This situation made zero sense. Bewildered, he belatedly examined the painting itself.\n\nWas his vision playing tricks? Or had Picasso deliberately enhanced his appearance? The portrait captured his smithing passion with such artistry that the result was... undeniably impressive.\n\n---\n\n**Twenty days later...**\n\n---\n\n> **[A temple dedicated to God Hexetia has been completed in Reinhardt, capital of the Overgeared Kingdom!]**\n>\n> **[This marks the first temple erected for Hexetia!]**\n>\n> **[The artistic value of the statues—perfect recreations of God Hexetia and Goddess Rebecca—reaches celestial heights!]**\n>\n> **[These new sacred artifacts will sharpen your insights. A pilgrimage to Reinhardt is highly recommended.]**\n\n---\n\nThe world message appeared before every player currently logged into Satisfy."
