  "content": "*Shhhh...*\n\nThe steady cascade of water drummed against tile. Building strength required consistency—something Grid had learned the hard way. Years of dedicated training had transformed his once-frail physique into solid muscle, each contour defined beneath the stream of cold water. The changes ran deeper than flesh; his spirit had been forged alongside his body. That transformation was the wellspring of his confidence.\n\n*The Magic Battle Gear Production Method has obvious strengths and weaknesses.*\n\nGrid tilted his head back, letting the cold water shock his overheated thoughts into clarity.\n\n*Beyond the standard metalworking, I have to infuse the material with magic. Four times the normal crafting duration, and the metal's durability takes a significant hit.*\n\nLifael's Spear served as the perfect case study. The original myth-rated weapon boasted 1,500 durability. After undergoing magical enhancement through repeated Magic Missile exposure, that number had plummeted to 990—a loss of one-third.\n\n*If I tried this on something with naturally low durability, like a dagger... it might become unusable entirely.*\n\nEquipment needed durability as a baseline requirement. Repeated use and repairs inevitably degraded maximum durability over time. Players avoided low-durability items for good reason.\n\n*For mass production or items meant for sale, the Magic Battle Gear Production Method isn't worth the investment.*\n\nThe enhanced items were objectively superior, of course. Lifael's Spear had emerged more magnificent than before. But such results only manifested because the base item was myth-rated.\n\n*The higher the item's initial rating, the more dramatic the improvement.*\n\nMost of Grid's creations averaged epic rating. Investing four times the normal production time for marginal gains made no economic sense.\n\n*However... for the core equipment my guild members will use, it's a different story.*\n\nSpending precious time on items for his comrades felt justified. The durability drawback was negated by his personal repair skills—when Grid himself performed maintenance, maximum durability remained intact.\n\n『 Global attention on the world's first player-established nation continues to intensify. This isn't just a South Korean phenomenon. Viewers worldwide are fixated on Overgeared's upcoming founding ceremony. Many are questioning why Overgeared, having already met the minimum requirements for kingdom establishment, continues to delay the official announcement. 』\n\n『 Preparation at this scale naturally requires time. This is an event capturing global interest across every nation. They're clearly aiming to create an unprecedented, spectacular founding ceremony. 』\n\n『 The palace restoration following the Belial raid will require considerable effort. 』\n\nThe bathroom wall-mounted television droned on about Overgeared as Grid showered. He caught the broadcast's content and shut off the water.\n\n*Busy times ahead.*\n\nAs the news predicted, Overgeared was orchestrating a founding ceremony of unprecedented grandeur. They would announce the supremacy of the world's greatest guild while billions of eyes watched. The scale exceeded what Lauel could manage alone. Every Overgeared member had assumed specific responsibilities, Grid included. Fourteen days remained until the ceremony, and he needed to craft reward items for the core members.\n\nLauel's plan was brilliantly calculated. Once the legendary blacksmith's creations were unveiled before billions of viewers at the kingdom's founding, the resulting shockwave would be tremendous. The vision was clear: new equipment would elevate the Overgeared Guild's power by orders of magnitude. Viewers witnessing this display would burn with envy and yearning to join Overgeared.\n\n\"Overgeared King... Heh.\"\n\nNo matter how he considered it, the name was perfect. Grid admired his own naming sense as he stepped from the bath and wrapped a towel around his wet hair.\n\n*Drrrrring—*\n\nThe living room phone chimed. Jishuka's name appeared on the display. Grid startled.\n\n*She's already secured sixty million gold?*\n\nSixty million gold represented an astronomical sum. No amount of in-game item sales could accumulate that total. She must have purchased gold from trading sites with real money—he couldn't imagine the transaction fees involved. Acknowledging Jishuka's extraordinary effort, Grid spoke clearly.\n\n\"Answer.\"\n\n*Beep—*\n\nThe ringing ceased. Video filled the screen, revealing Jishuka with an endless azure sea stretching behind her. As always, her smile radiated brilliance.\n\n\"Hi~! Grid...!\"\n\nShe tucked wind-blown strands of hair behind her ear, then abruptly froze, color flooding her cheeks.\n\n*Why?*\n\nGrid tilted his head in confusion while Jishuka's face deepened from pink to crimson, her gaze locked on one particular area of the screen.\n\n\"Are you... trying to seduce me?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nAh. He wasn't wearing any clothes. Belated embarrassment crashed over Grid as he bolted for his bedroom to grab something—*anything*. In the video feed, Jishuka vacillated between mortification and delight.\n\n\"He's absolutely perfect for me...\"\n\n***\n\n**Reinhardt Palace—Restoration Site**\n\n\"Erase every trace of Eternal's royal family.\"\n\nThe Eternal Kingdom had endured four centuries. Though Reinhardt Palace lay partially ruined from the Belial raid's aftermath, remnants of the dynasty persisted everywhere. From minor decorative flourishes to fundamental architectural philosophy. The persistence irritated Lauel.\n\n\"Historical value? There's no value in the history of losers. Remove all statues of Eternal's kings and erect Grid's statue in their place. Burn every item bearing the silver dragon emblem that symbolized Eternal, then brand the new items with hammer and anvil. All facilities designed for left-side traffic patterns will be converted to right-side traffic, and...\"\n\nLauel directed the construction teams with relentless precision. His hands remained constantly pressed to his scalp—the real-world habit of worrying about hair loss had transferred seamlessly into the game.\n\nAdministrator Rabbit approached with a report.\n\n\"Every royal family across the fifteen kingdoms has rejected the founding ceremony invitation. The continental atmosphere suggests no kingdom intends to acknowledge us.\"\n\nLauel didn't flinch.\n\n\"Expected.\"\n\nTechnically, Grid was a rebel who had toppled his own kingdom. Recognizing Grid meant legitimizing rebellion itself—an impossible position for other monarchies to accept. The Overgeared Kingdom would remain unrecognized.\n\n\"Diplomatic isolation will severely hinder national development. Do you have a solution?\"\n\nLauel nodded at Rabbit's question.\n\n\"Diplomatic quests will resolve it naturally.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nOvergeared was a player-established kingdom. Its evolution would inevitably follow player consensus, since most of Overgeared's population consisted of users rather than NPCs. Lauel's strategy focused on cultivating both NPC development and player growth. In other words: quests.\n\n*If Overgeared players venture into foreign kingdoms to hunt and complete quests repeatedly, our culture and influence will gradually permeate those nations. Eventually, those kingdoms will have no choice but to acknowledge and accept Overgeared's legitimacy.*\n\nA problem that would resolve through time and persistent effort. Only one concern required active management: disruption from hostile forces like the Saharan Empire, Ares, Agnus, and Blood Carnival. If powerful factions actively persecuted Overgeared players abroad, recruitment would stagnate. Most players would refuse to join.\n\n*We must demonstrate the power to prevent that outcome.*\n\nThey needed to prove their strength decisively. That's why he'd invited not only Kraugel, Damian, and Chris to the founding ceremony, but also high rankers who had previously been hostile.\n\n*I have to prove our influence is undeniable.*\n\nPlease let the invited rankers actually attend the ceremony.\n\nVantner approached the fervently praying Lauel and whispered conspiratorially.\n\n\"'Grow Head.' Unusual name, right? It's a Korean hair-loss medication. Apparently works well.\"\n\n\"Vantner, you...\"\n\nHe'd recognized Lauel's distress at a glance and recommended hair-loss medicine?\n\nLauel made an internal vow. Even with a blade at his throat, he would never use hair-loss medicine recommended by the completely bald Vantner. His confidence in such a recommendation was precisely zero.\n\n***\n\n**Rebecca Church—The Vatican**\n\n\"Many followers have volunteered for the Reinhardt temple construction effort.\"\n\n\"A reflection of their profound respect for Grid, who defeated the great demon Belial and restored peace to our world.\"\n\nThe Vatican's council chamber hummed with quiet discussion. Following the fall of Pope Drevigo and papal candidate Pascal, the high-ranking priests had ascended to positions of greater authority. Their gratitude and respect for Grid was genuine, filling Damian with satisfaction.\n\nSensing the positive atmosphere, Damian announced, \"I received an invitation from Grid to attend the Overgeared Kingdom's founding ceremony. I intend to accept. Would any of the elders care to accompany me?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nSilence crashed down like a physical weight. The elders manufactured polite smiles and sealed their mouths shut.\n\nDamian recognized his mistake.\n\n*They respect Grid, but supporting the Overgeared Kingdom could bring persecution from the Saharan Empire... That's a genuine concern. I was too short-sighted.*\n\nWould they pressure him to decline the invitation? As worry crept through Damian's thoughts—\n\n*Slam!*\n\nAll fifteen elders surged to their feet simultaneously. They fixed Damian with expressions bordering on resentment.\n\n\"W-What's wrong?\"\n\nDamian recoiled slightly under their intensity. Then the elders cried out in unison.\n\n\"This is outrageous! How can Your Holiness monopolize the opportunity to bless Grid's path?\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"We will accompany you! We shall lead all the believers of the Vatican to bless Grid and the Overgeared Kingdom!\"\n\n\"Please take us as well!\"\n\n\"...Yes. Of course.\"\n\nDamian nodded, stunned by the unexpectedly fervent response.\n\nBeside him, Isabel smiled radiantly. With her health fully restored and the shadows lifted from her mind, she had never looked more beautiful.\n\n***\n\n**Level 300 Dungeon—Location Unknown**\n\n\"Kraugel, what about you?\"\n\n\"Will you attend?\"\n\nSword Saint Kraugel. Hao and Alexander had tracked him down deep in a dungeon filled with level 300 monsters, which Kraugel was clearing solo. Would someone obsessed with reclaiming first place actually participate in the Overgeared Kingdom's founding ceremony? Alexander was convinced the answer would be no. Kraugel's hunger for strength exceeded anyone else's—he wouldn't appreciate having his training interrupted.\n\nBut Kraugel's response defied expectations.\n\n\"I'd like to attend. I can't let down a friend.\"\n\n\"...Excuse me?\"\n\nWhile Alexander stood dumbfounded, Hao chuckled softly.\n\nKraugel continued. \"If you're interested, why not come with me?\"\n\n\"I accept. I'll accompany you.\"\n\n\"...Understood. I'll attend with the Russian rankers as well.\""
