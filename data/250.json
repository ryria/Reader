The straw hat on his head did little to keep the sweat from pouring down his neck. His hands moved with mechanical precision, harvesting wheat like he'd done it his whole life.\n\n*This is insane.*\n\nWhy was a pope candidate breaking his back in a field during the busiest time of year? The answer lay one week in the past.\n\n---\n\n**One Week Ago**\n\nThe strange farmer blocked Damian's path, hand planted firmly on his hip. \"You can't enter Reidan unless you knock me down first.\"\n\nDamian stared at the man. *I stepped in shit.*\n\nPiaro. This farmer was certifiably insane. The evidence was undeniable. He'd grabbed a random stranger off the road and demanded a duel. When Damian refused, the lunatic turned into a thug. This aggressive, stubborn temperament went beyond eccentric. It crossed into dangerous.\n\nWorse, he was strong. Avoiding a powerful crazy person was nearly impossible.\n\n*I made a mistake.*\n\nDamian sighed. He'd traveled all this way to meet Grid, to ask him to seal Lifael's Spear. Instead, he was stuck dealing with a psychopath farmer who wouldn't let him pass.\n\n*Shit... I can't avoid this.*\n\nHe needed to see Grid. That meant knocking down this obstacle. Damian planted his feet and triggered **Light's Blessing**.\n\nA golden pillar of light crashed down from the heavens. Damian's muscles surged with power. His senses sharpened.\n\n> **[Light's Blessing]**  \n> Your attack power, defense, and accuracy have increased by 80% for 3 minutes.\n\nPiaro's eyes widened. \"Truly remarkable divine power!\"\n\nDamian gripped his sword. \"I'll accept your duel. Try not to die.\"\n\n\"Good fighting spirit.\" Piaro's hand moved to the sword at his waist.\n\nNo more words. They collided.\n\nDamian fought like a machine, his one-handed sword technique polished through countless battles. Piaro discarded his hand plow and hoe, drawing steel. Their blades sang. The clash looked fierce, almost even.\n\nIt lasted ten minutes.\n\nThen Damian hit the dirt.\n\n\"Your defense surpasses the emperor's royal guards.\" Piaro loomed over him, not even breathing hard. \"Your healing power rivals a priest's. You're the first to last this long against me. This... this will be excellent for training my swordsmanship.\"\n\nDamian's ears rang. He couldn't hear the praise through the roar of his own disbelief.\n\n*This can't be happening.*\n\nThanks to Grid's equipment, Damian had become the Goddess' Agent. He'd carved through monsters by the hundreds. Boss monsters that made others flee? He tanked their attacks for hours without breaking a sweat.\n\nHe was the peak of the paladin class. He'd believed that with every fiber of his being.\n\nAnd a *farmer* just demolished him in ten minutes.\n\n\"This is ridiculous!\" The words tore out of his throat.\n\nAnother figure approached. Another farmer, face shadowed beneath a wide-brimmed hat. Kraugel, though Damian didn't know it yet.\n\nThe second farmer stopped in front of him. \"Let's fight.\"\n\n\"...You've got to be kidding me!\" Damian's voice cracked. \"Fine! Fight! Let's fight! You farmers don't know when to quit!\"\n\nHis hands shook as he raised his sword. The result? Another loss. This time he managed twenty minutes. It was not a comfort.\n\n\"Unbelievable!\" Damian sat in the dirt, head in his hands.\n\nTwo consecutive losses to farmers. He'd thought he was the protagonist of his own story. Turned out he was just a background character.\n\nPiaro crouched beside him. \"Duke Grid is away right now. He won't return for at least three weeks. Why don't we make use of the time?\"\n\nDamian looked up slowly. \"What?\"\n\nPiaro pointed at the endless wheat field. \"Work in the morning. Spar in the afternoon.\"\n\n\"...What?\"\n\n*This farmer is insane.*\n\nDamian opened his mouth to refuse. A window materialized in his vision.\n\n> **★ Hidden Quest ★**  \n> **[Fun and Enjoyable Training!]**\n>\n> Live with the farmer Piaro in Reidan. If you join him, you can grow significantly.\n>\n> **Quest Clear Conditions:** Live together with Piaro for three weeks. You must perfectly follow Piaro's schedule.\n>\n> **Quest Clear Rewards:**  \n> **Strength +30**  \n> **Stamina +60**  \n> **Advanced Sword Mastery** will rise by two levels.  \n> The skill **'Farming'** will be obtained.\n\nDamian's breath caught.\n\n*Advanced Sword Mastery* normally required three months of non-stop grinding to gain a single level. This quest offered two levels in three weeks. Plus ninety stat points. The equivalent of nine level-ups.\n\n*The farming skill is useless, but...*\n\nThe quest was too good to refuse. The name sounded ominous, but he'd faced worse. Maybe the crazy farmer wasn't blowing smoke after all.\n\nDamian accepted.\n\n---\n\n**Present Day**\n\nOne week of hell. That's what it had been.\n\nDamian was stronger now, though the quest hadn't updated yet. His stats remained the same. But daily sparring against Piaro and the nameless farmer had sharpened his control to a razor's edge.\n\nHe could now last fifteen minutes against Piaro.\n\n*I should be happy, but...*\n\nThe confusion gnawed at him. Who was Piaro, really? And why did wielding a sickle feel almost natural now? He was forgetting himself. Forgetting he was a paladin, not a farmer.\n\n*But I need to see Grid.*\n\nThere was no point in agonizing while he waited. Damian cleared his mind and returned to work. He hoisted ten bundles of harvested wheat onto his shoulders. The weight barely registered anymore.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nMovement on the horizon. Beyond the wheat fields, a group approached. Not just a few travelers. *Hundreds.*\n\nDamian squinted. \"Who are they?\"\n\nNo visitors had come to Reidan all week. The city was isolated, cut off from the kingdom. So why was an army suddenly marching toward them?\n\nPiaro appeared beside him, grinning. \"Very welcome guests.\"\n\nDamian's stomach dropped at the farmer's enthusiasm.\n\n---\n\n**Libra Oasis**\n\nThe gathering place of the seven guilds hummed with tension.\n\n\"They have no concept of time.\" Seuron of the Golden Guild checked his interface again.\n\nTen minutes past the agreed meeting time. Six guilds were supposed to be here. The Giant Guild had declined. But the Ice Flower Guild, Yak Guild, and Zeraph Guild still hadn't shown.\n\nSeuron turned to Zibal. \"How much longer should I waste? You think our time means nothing?\"\n\nThe Golden Guild was the third largest guild in Satisfy, after Snake and Giant. Lately, their pride had swelled to match their numbers. Their master, Seuron, had acquired a unique hidden class. During the National Competition, he'd been ranked 70th. Now? 23rd on the unified rankings.\n\nAnalysts predicted his class, **Soul Predator**, had higher combat potential than even Pagma's Descendant.\n\nZibal kept his voice level. \"We wait ten more minutes. We shouldn't move without a full force.\"\n\nHao, master of the Hades Guild and 16th on the unified rankings, folded his arms. Even Yura had admitted she couldn't beat him. Zibal had no interest in starting a fight.\n\n*It doesn't matter. Reidan is empty.*\n\nThe Snake Guild alone could level the city. But Zibal had called for aid to cement alliances. The Giant Guild, Golden Guild, and Hades Guild. With them, he'd have security. At least for now.\n\n\"Fine. We move on Reidan.\"\n\nSnake Guild: 275 members.  \nGolden Guild: 211 members.  \nHades Guild: 70 members.\n\nOver five hundred players marched toward the empty city. No one discussed strategy for the NPC guards. They weren't a threat. NPC soldiers couldn't match organized players.\n\n\"Developing such a large city as farmland.\" Zibal surveyed the endless wheat fields. \"Grid has no talent for management.\"\n\nHe turned to his strongest magician. \"Burn the fields first.\"\n\nBig Boy nodded. \"Leave it to me.\"\n\nThe mage began gathering mana when a voice cut through the heat.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nFour figures emerged from the wheat. Farmers, from the look of them. They carried hand plows, scythes, and hoes. One stepped forward, adjusting his straw hat.\n\n\"You reek of killing intent. Are you enemies of Reidan?\"\n\nZibal burst out laughing. A *farmer* was challenging an army of over five hundred. The audacity was hilarious.\n\n\"Are you like your master?\" Zibal grinned. \"Even the farmers here are idiots.\"\n\nHe laughed until his sides hurt. Then his expression went cold.\n\n\"Kill them.\"\n\nSimple as swatting flies. That's all these farmers were. Flies.\n\nBig Boy raised his staff. **[Flame Tsunami]**, a large-scale A-grade spell designed to incinerate everything in its path. Perfect for burning wheat fields and pest farmers simultaneously.\n\nFire roared to life. The heat became oppressive. The four farmers would be ash in seconds.\n\n\"Eh? What?!\" Big Boy's voice cracked.\n\nEveryone froze.\n\nThe farmer swung his hoe. The tsunami of flames *vanished*. Just... gone. Like it had never existed.\n\n\"What just happened?\"\n\nMurmurs rippled through the guild members. Confusion turned to unease.\n\nPiaro tossed his straw hat aside and smiled. \"Welcome to Reidan.\"\n\n\"Battle formation! Now!\" Zibal's instincts screamed. Something was wrong.\n\nToo late.\n\nPiaro moved. One moment he stood twenty meters away. The next, he was in front of Zibal.\n\n\"**Fated to Perish**.\"\n\nThunder cracked. The hand plow blurred.\n\n*Thunk.*\n\nThe sharpened end of the tool punched through Zibal's forehead.\n\n> **[You have suffered fatal damage!]**  \n> **[You have died.]**\n\n\"???\"\n\nThe 2nd ranked user collapsed. Dead. One hit.\n\nFive hundred and fifty players stood frozen, minds unable to process what they'd witnessed.\n\nKraugel and Damian stared. Kraugel's eyes narrowed behind his hat. Damian's jaw hung open.\n\n\"An instant-death skill...\" Damian whispered.\n\n*Broken. Completely broken.*\n\nPiaro was more powerful than either of them had imagined. Far, far more.\n\n*Who the hell is this man?*\n\nThe guild members finally snapped back to awareness. Fear replaced confusion.\n\n\"W-Who are you?!\"\n\nFive hundred players backed away from one farmer. The image would've been comical if it wasn't so terrifying.\n\nPiaro looked at them calmly. \"I am a farmer of Reidan.\"\n\nIt wasn't a lie. He received **73 silver** per month from Administrator Rabbit. He enjoyed saving the money. It was simple work for simple pay.\n\nFor reference, Rabbit earned **5,300 gold** monthly.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms:**  \nOG: Glossary Link.\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and well as achieve the goals for extra chapters.
