  "content": "\"Soul Decay.\"\n\n\"Dirty Whispers.\"\n\n\"Mel-Pia's Land.\"\n\n\"Rising Desire.\"\n\nBlack magic converged on Damian from every direction—curses meant to rot his body, shatter his mind, corrupt his soul. The thousands of black magicians expected him to crumble. Instead, notifications flooded his vision.\n\n[The pope cannot be corrupted by darkness.]\n\n[The 'decay' state has been resisted.]\n\n[The 'confused' state has been resisted.]\n\n[The 'hunger' state has been resisted.]\n\n[The 'berserk' state has been resisted.]\n\nNothing touched him. Damian's 80% dark resistance and complete immunity to black magic crowd control made him untouchable. The black magicians stared, their confidence evaporating as their magic splashed harmlessly against an invisible wall.\n\nThe battlefield shifted.\n\n[The emergence of the Rebecca Church's pope has reduced the morale of the Yatan Church members.]\n\n[The defense and magic resistance of Yatan Church members have been reduced by 60%.]\n\n[Yatan's Servants have a duty to lead their followers. The morale of Yatan's Servants is not affected.]\n\nRose's body lurched as her defenses plummeted. Around her, black magicians who'd held their ground for hours suddenly buckled under the knights' assault. *This is his true strength.*\n\nDamian surveyed the carnage—the knights with blood-soaked armor, the church members trembling from exhaustion. They'd endured every curse thrown at them while he'd been trapped. Fought through pain that would've broken lesser men.\n\nHe raised his hand.\n\n[Light Rain Lv. 1]\n\nGolden droplets materialized in the air, spreading across three hundred meters in every direction. The divine rain kissed the skin of ally and enemy alike, but its touch brought vastly different reactions.\n\n\"Kuaaaack!\" Black magicians clawed at their flesh as the holy water burned.\n\n\"I can breathe again!\" A knight straightened, the pallor fading from his face.\n\n\"His Holiness saved us!\"\n\nThe Rebecca Church rallied. Wounds closed. Minds cleared. The battle wasn't over, but suddenly, victory seemed possible.\n\nRose stumbled, her skin blistering where the rain touched. *How did he escape?* The barrier they'd crafted—Yatan Essence combined with their most powerful black magic—should've held him until the end. That essence had corrupted one of the empire's strongest knights. It had fueled Drevigo's fall. It could even damage the World Tree.\n\nNothing escaped a barrier reinforced with Yatan Essence.\n\nNothing.\n\n\"Rebecca's dog!\" Aliburn's shout cut through the battlefield. The Third Servant gestured toward the sword embedded in stone. \"Stop this wretched rain, or watch your precious symbol disappear!\"\n\nThe elders of the Rebecca Church froze. Their Holy Sword—centuries of history made manifest—in the hands of the enemy.\n\n\"What should we do?\" one whispered.\n\nDamian met Aliburn's gaze. \"Destroy it.\"\n\nSilence crashed over the battlefield.\n\n\"What?\" Aliburn blinked.\n\n\"I said destroy it.\" Damian's voice carried across the Vatican grounds. \"It's a worthless antique.\"\n\n\"You—\" The elder started to protest.\n\n\"A symbol?\" Damian spoke over him. \"Goddess Rebecca is our symbol. Does destroying a sword unmake a pope? Our history lives in countless books, in the hearts of believers. I won't sacrifice living souls for a piece of metal.\"\n\nAliburn's face twisted. \"That's absurd! You deny the value of every artifact on the continent!\"\n\n\"Do I?\" Damian tilted his head. \"You serve great demons. You want to turn humanity into cattle. Since when do you care about the value of artifacts?\"\n\nThe Third Servant's mouth opened, then closed.\n\n\"No relic from the past,\" Damian continued, \"matters more than the people standing here right now. Do you understand, villain?\"\n\nYears of manga and anime had shaped Damian's worldview. Simple truths delivered with conviction—the kind Aliburn had no counter for. Not when the moral high ground belonged entirely to Damian.\n\nThe Yatan Church members' morale cracked further. Even some Rebecca followers looked uncertain, disappointed by their pope's apparent willingness to abandon their sacred sword.\n\nDamian didn't care. He had the *Recapture the Holy Sword* quest—failure meant devastating penalties. But showing weakness now would be worse. If he'd begged and pleaded for the sword's safety, Aliburn would've leveraged it mercilessly. Better to call the bluff.\n\n\"Kuoh...\" Aliburn clutched the sword tighter, but the threat in the gesture had vanished.\n\n*Perfect.* Damian kept his expression neutral, hiding his satisfaction.\n\n\"Fine! I'll handle this myself!\" Aliburn thrust his hand skyward. \"Come forth, Hell's Keepers!\"\n\nCerberuses materialized—massive three-headed dogs that charged Damian with fire pouring from their jaws. The heat forced him back despite his divine protection.\n\nThen Hill moved.\n\nFor someone so rotund, the Seventh Servant covered ground with shocking speed. Damian's eyes widened as he dodged away from the flames—directly into Hill's range.\n\n\"My stone fists fly twelve times per second!\" Hill's arms blurred. \"Haaaap!\"\n\nTwelve impacts hammered Damian's armor in the span of a heartbeat. Again. Again. The monk's fists were small, almost comical, but struck with the force of boulders.\n\n\"Kuhahaha! Can you handle Hill's twelve punches per second?\"\n\nThe pope who'd dominated thousands of black magicians staggered like a beaten dog. Hill grinned, already imagining the kill.\n\nBut Damian had fought Grid.\n\nHe'd faced Link—thirty strikes per second, each one potentially lethal. Twelve punches? Slow by comparison.\n\nHis shield spell absorbed impacts. His eyes tracked the pattern. Hill's rhythm became predictable—twelve rapid strikes, then a half-second pause to breathe.\n\nDamian's blade lanced out during that pause.\n\n\"Keok!\" Hill's eyes bulged as steel pierced his gut.\n\n\"I've fought monsters much faster than you,\" Damian said.\n\nDivine light surged through him, amplifying his strength to its peak. Meanwhile...\n\n[The demon, Dyulebul, has been badly damaged and fled.]\n\n[The demon, Cao, has gotten into great trouble and fled.]\n\n[Lich Mumud has less than 20% health remaining. Be careful.]\n\n*This bastard!*\n\nLight Rain didn't discriminate. Agnus, already battered and bleeding, took the holy damage full force. He'd thought Damian was an ally, someone who'd help him fight the Yatan Church.\n\nInstead, the pope attacked everything evil in range.\n\nAgnus glared at Silvenas across from him. The Fourth Servant was also scorched by holy rain, skin blistering.\n\n\"I'll kill you first!\" Agnus snarled.\n\n\"Traitor! I'll tear you apart!\"\n\n\"Then I'll take the pope's head!\"\n\n\"Fine! Curse that Rebecca dog together! Wait...\" Silvenas paused. \"Are we enemies or allies?\"\n\nThe absurdity of fighting a madman who kept switching sides made Silvenas want to scream.\n\nMeanwhile, in a village below the Vatican, Sticks materialized on the road leading upward.\n\n\"This is a problem.\" He frowned at the invisible barrier blocking the path. \"I can't teleport directly inside. The barrier only permits evil beings. I'll need time to analyze and break it down...\"\n\nGrid stared at the shimmering wall of energy. Paladins shifted nervously behind him.\n\n\"Blackening.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty!\"\n\nSticks moved to stop him—going through alone was madness. Mercedes caught the sage's arm.\n\n\"The king will rescue his queen and prince.\"\n\nSticks gaped at her. *That's the attitude of a knight sworn to protect him?*\n\nGrid smiled. \"Exactly. Follow once you break the barrier. I'll protect Irene and Lord until—\"\n\nDozens of black magic spells erupted toward him simultaneously."
