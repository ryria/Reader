  "content": "# Chapter: The First King's Coronation\n\nThe world's eyes burned hot on Reinhardt. Overgeared—the first player-built kingdom—commanded global attention, and media crews from every major network descended upon the capital like vultures to a feast.\n\n\"Reposition cameras five and seven! I want Grid covered from every angle!\" A director's voice cracked with urgency.\n\n\"Japanese viewership is spiking for Katz—get a cam on him, intermittent shots!\" Another shouted into their headset.\n\n\"Overgeared's loaded with beauties. Crank those lights up, maximize the glamour shots—*Hey!* Why the hell are you filming Vantner? You trying to kill our ratings?\"\n\nEach broadcaster sculpted their coverage to match their audience's appetite. Romance-focused networks zoomed in on anyone handsome. Information networks delivered crisp analysis of Grid, Reinhardt, and the Overgeared Guild's strategic position. Political channels assembled expert panels to dissect the nascent kingdom's future with surgical precision.\n\n\"Kuk... I'm nervous.\"\n\nCameras bristled like a steel forest. Lights blazed from every corner.\n\nSeveral Overgeared members shifted uncomfortably, acutely aware that the entire world watched them. Most had come from the Silver Knights Guild—high rankers, yes, but unused to the media's hungry gaze.\n\n\"You're citizens of South Korea *and* the Overgeared Kingdom.\" Peak Sword's voice cut through their anxiety like a blade. \"Straighten those shoulders. No shrinking back.\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nHis words worked like a spell. The Silver Knights members squared their stances, meeting the cameras with pride.\n\n> ***Live Commentary***\n> \n> \"Interesting observation—Overgeared's roster skews heavily Asian.\"\n> \n> \"Mostly Korean, actually. Natural result of absorbing the Silver Knights Guild.\"\n> \n> \"What surprises me is the lack of national bias. Most country-anchored guilds show favoritism. Why doesn't Overgeared?\"\n> \n> \"That's Grid's genius showing through. Overgeared started multinational. If he prioritized one country too heavily, he'd alienate members from others. Grid deliberately stripped away national colors to prevent that fracture.\"\n> \n> \"Just look at Katz as proof. A famous Japanese nationalist, yet he's integrated seamlessly into Overgeared. Grid's coordination skills are exceptional.\"\n> \n> \"Expected from someone who built networks spanning both players and NPCs.\"\n> \n> \"His capacity as a leader defies ordinary measurement. Grid operates beyond standard parameters. Recently, Chinese commentators claimed he's Liu Bei reincarnated.\"\n> \n> \"Liu Bei? From the Three Kingdoms era? *Hah*, truly. China still insists on claiming anything exceptional as theirs. Why would Korean Grid be a Chinese historical figure reborn?\"\n> \n> \"Ahem. Please refrain from personal commentary during broadcast.\"\n\nThose who once mocked Grid had vanished like morning mist.\n\nHe'd proven his worth through countless trials, built achievements so towering that even former critics stopped calling him a psychopath. But could anyone truly grasp another person's full measure? The world still hadn't plumbed Grid's depths.\n\n*Liu Bei reincarnated? What absolute nonsense!*\n\nGrid's jaw clenched as he caught fragments of the commentary. Pangea's Lord of Virtue—a title with some probability of sparing monsters during hunts. He'd acquired this useless distinction through pure misunderstanding, and it grated on him like sand in his boot.\n\n\"Ugh, this is ridiculous. Why isn't there a feature to delete titles?\"\n\nGrid waited for the coronation, frustration simmering, when Lauel materialized through the crowd.\n\n\"Generally speaking, titles connect directly to Satisfy's lore and narrative framework. If players could delete them at will, the entire story architecture would collapse.\"\n\n\"...What the hell are you wearing?\"\n\nGrid's voice died in his throat. Lauel stood before him with a black eye patch covering his left eye and a black mask obscuring his mouth. Both items served zero function—pure aesthetic choices favored by middle schoolers everywhere. Lauel caught Grid's bewildered expression and raised two fingers in a peace sign.\n\n\"Kukukuk! Grid, I coordinated this style to match yours. A recreation of my dragon knight days. Pretty cool, right?\"\n\n*What a waste of a perfectly good face.*\n\nPorcelain skin and silver hair—Lauel possessed the kind of mysterious beauty that seemed lifted straight from a manhwa panel. He should've been breaking hearts left and right. Instead, he'd embraced the chuuni lifestyle, devoting himself entirely to his eccentric aesthetic instead of romance. Grid couldn't imagine how many women mourned this loss.\n\n\"Tsk tsk...\"\n\n*He'll die alone at this rate.*\n\nGrid clicked his tongue and turned back toward the window.\n\nSuddenly, the crowd's energy shifted. People began moving with purpose.\n\n*What's happening?*\n\nThe atmosphere transformed, electric and tense.\n\n***\n\n> ***Breaking News Alert***\n> \n> \"Breaking news! Player reports indicate Eternal noble remnants gathering near Reinhardt!\"\n> \n> \"Armed troops under noble command number as high as one hundred thousand! Meanwhile, Reinhardt's garrison holds no more than five thousand!\"\n> \n> \"Most Overgeared forces are currently concentrated in Reidan.\"\n> \n> \"Reidan? Why would they—deploying troops elsewhere right before a major event...\"\n> \n> \"The Saharan Empire, obviously. If they'd stationed everyone in Reinhardt, Reidan becomes a sitting duck for imperial forces.\"\n> \n> \"So... they guarded against the empire but forgot about the Eternal nobles?\"\n> \n> \"Precisely. This represents a clear Overgeared miscalculation—failure to think several moves ahead. Grid and Lauel have overcome previous crises through superior tactics and overwhelming force, but their strategic depth remains shallow compared to our expert analysts.\"\n\nThe founding ceremony—mere minutes away—collapsed into chaos. Anchors, panelists, and gathered players alike began to panic.\n\n\"Shouldn't we evacuate? We'll get caught in the crossfire!\"\n\n\"I didn't come here to die watching an event. Let's move!\"\n\n\"Wait, what's everyone panicking about? Grid's fought hundred-thousand-strong armies before. Plus, Overgeared's high rankers are all gathered here. Those enemies will be slaughtered instantly.\"\n\n\"Are you stupid? Don't you understand how the new episodes work? Monsters and NPCs are leagues stronger than in previous content!\"\n\n\"Enemy soldiers who might've been under level two hundred during the war episode have probably completed their second advancement by now. You think even Grid can handle a hundred thousand second advancement soldiers?\"\n\n\"Even if Grid and Overgeared somehow win, what about *us*? Think the enemies will ignore bystanders?\"\n\nThe frightened players devolved into chaos. Some already sprinted toward the palace exits—only to find their path blocked by Overgeared soldiers.\n\n\"Out of the way! I want to leave!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nPlayers shouted. The soldiers remained stone-faced and unmoved. International broadcasters and their expert panels decoded the situation.\n\n> \"Wait... I think I understand why Grid sealed the entrance!\"\n> \n> \"What are you suggesting?\"\n> \n> \"Grid intends to use the gathered players as *sacrifices!*\"\n> \n> \"Good god...!\"\n\nEveryone currently inside the palace would appear identical from the enemy perspective. The attacking force wouldn't discriminate—they'd slaughter anyone they saw while hunting Grid and Overgeared members.\n\n\"Demon!\"\n\n\"Grid is a *demon!*\"\n\nThe crowd remembered Grid's old epithets. Psychopath. Butcher. Recently, people called him virtuous, but what lay beneath that mask?\n\n\"H-Hik...!\"\n\n*Kung!*\n\n*Kung kung kung kung!*\n\nThe ground trembled. The sound of tens of thousands of boots shaking the earth—troops surrounding the palace. Players descended into terrified confusion while broadcasters delivered real-time coverage.\n\n**—Wow, so Overgeared's going to sacrifice innocent people to save themselves?**\n\n**—Absolutely vicious.**\n\n**—Better than being deceived by false kindness.**\n\n**—Does this really deserve to be the first player-built kingdom?**\n\nGlobal reactions fractured. Some condemned Overgeared. Others approved of the ruthless choice. Still others insisted it represented the optimal survival strategy. The turmoil swelled like a rising tide.\n\n*Step.*\n\nGrid appeared in the palace's main hall for the first time. He strode toward the entrance while thousands of players fixed him with resentful, accusatory stares. Then...\n\n*Kuuong!*\n\nThe marching thunder beyond the walls ceased. The hundred thousand troops led by Eternal nobles had reached the palace.\n\n\"D-Dammit!\"\n\n\"Why can't I log out?!\"\n\nPlayers' faces drained of color. Grid, by contrast, remained perfectly calm. His uniquely sharp gaze swept across the crowd.\n\n\"Open the gate.\"\n\nThe order fell like an executioner's blade.\n\n\"...!!!\"\n\nPlayers and broadcast staff alike recoiled in horror. Opening the gate with enemies massed outside? Everyone concluded Grid had lost his mind, condemnation rising like a wave. But Grid didn't retract the command, and the soldiers pulled open the firmly sealed gates.\n\n*Kiiiiiiiik—!*\n\nThe massive doors groaned open. Tens of thousands of armored figures came into view, the city sprawling behind them. Players stood frozen, convinced Grid had sentenced them all to death. However—\n\n*Cheok!*\n\nThe tens of thousands gathered beyond the gate didn't surge forward in a killing frenzy. Instead, they assumed a military formation, standing at rigid attention.\n\n> \"W-What is this?\"\n\nPlayers and broadcast crews stood paralyzed with shock.\n\n\"We see King Grid!\"\n\n\"*Attention!*\"\n\nThe tens of thousands saluted Grid in perfect synchronization, voices rising in a thunderous chorus. At their head stood Marquis Steim. The spectacle defied description—not just the players present, but millions watching across the globe felt their skin prickle with goosebumps.\n\nAs the world reeled in shock and confusion, Grid addressed the saluting army.\n\n\"In the name of Overgeared King Grid, I hereby commence the founding ceremony.\"\n\n> [A new kingdom has risen on the West Continent! The Overgeared Kingdom! Its king is Grid!]\n> \n> [The first player to claim a throne has emerged! His legendary achievement shall be recorded in Satisfy's eternal history!]\n\n*Snap! Snap snap!*\n\nEvery light the broadcasters had prepared swiveled to focus on Grid. Thousands of cameras captured nothing but his figure. As the military band launched into a triumphant march, viewership ratings for the founding ceremony exploded through the ceiling.\n\nA new era had begun."
