  "content": "*Clang!*\n\n*Screeeech!*\n\nStrike after strike yielded the same result. Grid's blade skittered off the barrier without leaving so much as a mark. The system's protection was absolute.\n\n*Dammit. Why don't I get invincibility when I'm crafting?*\n\nItem Combination never granted him immunity—blatant discrimination, really. And that was from a hidden piece, no less.\n\nGrid's gaze bored into Kruger through the translucent wall. The death knight crouched low, scissors and chisels flashing as he carved cloth into precise shapes before stitching them together. A skeleton hunched over needlework...\n\nIt should have been absurd. Anyone else would laugh at the sight of Death Knight Kruger playing seamstress. But Grid's expression only grew more grim.\n\n*Those bony fingers move so fast, so precisely...*\n\nHaving acquired intermediate Tailoring, Grid recognized mastery when he saw it. His awe deepened as he watched.\n\n*He's blending completely different fabrics—making them flow together seamlessly. This is legendary tailoring...*\n\nGrid's own skills paled in comparison. He could barely work with two types of cloth at once while maintaining their essential properties. Most of his fabric items performed only marginally better than village store goods, elevated solely by his dexterity stat. As for true tailoring technique? He had a long road ahead.\n\n*Not that I want to be a tailor anyway...*\n\nHe shook his head, banishing the distraction.\n\n*Focus on the fight. This battle is mine to win.*\n\nWhy craft mid-combat? The answer was obvious. Kruger had analyzed Grid's equipment with his Legendary Tailor's Eye and was now creating a counter-item in real time. A terrifying ability—one that could shift any battle's momentum.\n\n*But you picked the wrong opponent.*\n\nGrid's smile turned predatory as he stowed the Enlightenment Blade. When his hand emerged from his inventory, it held Alex's Magic Engineering Bayonet.\n\n*While you're busy sewing...*\n\n*Click! Click-click-click!*\n\nThe weapon transformed—barrel extending, scope materializing—until Grid held a meter-long sniper rifle, its ivory surface gleaming with lethal grace. Kruger squatted eighty meters away, fully absorbed in his work.\n\nPerfect.\n\nThe bayonet's sniper mode carried a fixed instant death function. At this range, Grid needed two minutes to aim properly. Time that would normally be a liability... but right now? Kruger was trapped behind his crafting barrier.\n\n*The moment you finish that item, it's already over.*\n\nGrid dropped into position, rifle braced, breathing controlled. No tremor in his hands as the crosshairs settled on Kruger's skull—years of mandatory military service paying dividends.\n\n*One shot. That's all it takes.*\n\nHis finger tightened on the trigger. Kruger remained oblivious, hunched over his work, never suspecting the death aimed at his head.\n\nMeanwhile, on the 62nd island.\n\n\"No—he's made a mistake!\"\n\nAlarm flashed across Sticks' face as he watched Grid through the crystal ball. The legendary blacksmith had misunderstood a fundamental rule.\n\n\"Instant death doesn't work on death knights!\"\n\nInstant death techniques operated by severing an opponent's life force. Against the living, they were absolute. But the undead had no life to sever—the technique would simply fail. Grid should know this. He *did* know this, at least conceptually—his own Immortal skill exploited the same principle. How could he forget when facing the undead?\n\n*Wait... perhaps it's inevitable.*\n\nSticks' frustration softened. Grid had grown up in an era of peace, shaped by the sacrifices of past legends. Humanity had flourished. Monsters had dwindled. Undead in particular had nearly vanished—corpses were rare, and without corpses, no undead could spawn.\n\nGrid simply lacked experience. He'd never truly faced the undead before, never used an instant death skill himself.\n\n*He's going to pay dearly for this lesson...*\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nThrough the crystal ball, Grid fired the instant Kruger's barrier dissipated. Sticks watched helplessly, knowing what came next. Death Knight Kruger would shrug off the instant death and retaliate with devastating force.\n\nExactly as predicted.\n\n*Thud!*\n\nKruger surged through the bullet's impact, hurling needles that Grid failed to dodge. Crisis incoming. Sticks leaned forward, willing Grid to survive.\n\n\"Push through! It's a harsh lesson, but if you keep your head...!\"\n\n***\n\n[Target in sight!]\n\n*BOOM!*\n\nThe rifle's roar split the air.\n\n\"Ugh!\"\n\nGrid's teeth clenched against the recoil. Even braced on the ground in perfect stance, the kickback was brutal. Yura's lower strength would probably dislocate her shoulder.\n\n*BOOM!*\n\nThe mana bullet tore through the space where Kruger had been crafting. Two thousand mana for a single shot. Grid expected immediate results.\n\n*KIYAAAAAH!*\n\n\"What the—?\"\n\nKruger was fine. A hole gaped through the center of his skull, yet his health bar hadn't budged. Worse—he was charging straight at Grid.\n\n\"Shit!\"\n\nGrid dismissed the rifle mid-panic, Enlightenment Blade materializing in its place. Kruger closed the distance and unleashed a barrage of needles.\n\n*Clang!*\n\n*Claaaang!*\n\nGrid activated Quick Movements, body blurring between the projectiles.\n\n*Thunk! Thuuunk!*\n\nBut Kruger exploited the opening. He lunged, driving a needle into Grid's chest.\n\n[You have suffered 1,570 damage.]\n\n[Blood vessel pierced. Impaired circulation. Health recovery blocked for 20 seconds.]\n\n[You cannot resist.]\n\n[You have suffered 1,390 damage.]\n\n[Joint disruption. Left arm paralyzed for 13 seconds.]\n\n[You cannot resist.]\n\n[You have suffered 1,642 damage.]\n\n[Mana reflux detected. Exercise caution when using skills.]\n\n[You cannot resist.]\n\n\"Are you kidding me?!\"\n\nThis was dexterity weaponized. Kruger's thousands of dexterity points let him thread needles through the gaps in Triple Layers, striking vital points for critical damage. Not only did Grid take more damage than normal armor penetration would cause, he was drowning in debuffs.\n\nBut Grid kept his composure.\n\n\"Magic Missile!\"\n\n[Failed to activate Magic Missile.]\n\n[Health decreased by triple the consumed mana.]\n\nA calculated gamble. Kruger's last needle prevented one skill use, so Grid deliberately chose the cheapest option to minimize the backlash. While Quick Movements kept him mobile, he launched into Pagma's Swordsmanship.\n\nLink.\n\n*Whoosh!*\n\n*Whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh!*\n\nKruger had no answer for the twenty-plus energy blades that erupted toward him.\n\n*BOOM!*\n\n*BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!*\n\nThe blades moved so fast time seemed to freeze. Through his crystal ball, Sticks witnessed Link's synergy with the Enlightenment Blade—black flames detonating nine times around Kruger's position.\n\n*Yes!*\n\nGrid prepared to press his advantage, already planning the finishing blow. Then the notification windows appeared.\n\n[The Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires dealt 30% additional fire damage!]\n\n[Target has neutralized all fire damage.]\n\n[The Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires dealt 5,000 fire damage!]\n\n[Target has neutralized all fire damage.]\n\n[The Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires dealt 30% additional dark damage!]\n\n[Target has maximized darkness affinity. Dark attribute damage increased by 10%.]\n\n[Darkness empowers the undead.]\n\n[Target recovered 98,500 health.]\n\n[Black Flames activated from the Sword Born from Enlightenment and Strong Desires!]\n\n[Target failed to neutralize black flames.]\n\n[You dealt 667,940 damage!]\n\n\"You bastard!\"\n\nLink's damage output had plummeted. In those ten minutes of crafting, Kruger had created cloth armor that maximized dark resistance while negating fire entirely. Impressive that he could bolster his strengths while eliminating his weaknesses. Named NPCs possessed frighteningly high intelligence.\n\nFortunately, black flames operated as an independent attribute—neither fire nor darkness. Kruger had no defense against them.\n\n*Crack.*\n\n*Crack-crack-crack-crack!*\n\nThe explosion shattered Kruger's right leg joint. Even as he fired a few parting needles, the death knight retreated. The barrier materialized once more.\n\nAnother crafting session.\n\n\"Again?!\"\n\nGrid's hands trembled.\n\nMaintaining combat flow was difficult enough without these constant interruptions. This confirmed it—Satisfy's developers had truly wicked minds.\n\n[For the next 20 minutes, Legendary Tailor Kruger will craft an item!]\n\n\"Twenty minutes? An extra ten?\"\n\nFirst Kruger survived instant death, now this extended crafting time. Grid's mental exhaustion doubled at the thought of standing idle for another twenty minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, Sticks watched through his crystal ball, prayers urgent.\n\n\"Grid, you must defeat Kruger to cleanse the 63rd island. If this pattern continues, Kruger will keep adapting until you can't win anymore.\"\n\n*Please. Please realize this.*\n\nHe willed the message across the distance, desperate for Grid to understand the stakes. But Grid's thoughts ran elsewhere.\n\n\"Fine. Two can play this game.\"\n\n\"...!!\"\n\nSticks' eyes widened. Through the crystal ball, Grid pulled out a portable furnace and blacksmithing hammer.\n\n\"This method...!\"\n\nFight fire with fire. Counter crafting with crafting! Sticks' admiration soared at Grid's audacity and resolve."
