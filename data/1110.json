The capsule's control panel, usually so familiar, might as well have been a foreign instrument.\n\n*Clack.*\n\nAfter a full minute of fumbling, his hands finally steadied. The capsule lid hissed open with that familiar mechanical whir—the sound of sci-fi dreams made real. His sanctuary. The one place in existence where hell couldn't touch him.\n\n\"Luna...\"\n\nAgnus collapsed into the capsule more than sat.\n\n*Soon. God, so soon.*\n\nTwo deaths. Two mandatory logout penalties. Twenty-four hours trapped in the real world, unable to sleep, unable to think of anything except *her*. His lover. His only reason for existing.\n\n*I'll see you again. In this world, at least, I can have you.*\n\nThe hollow promise dissolved as his consciousness plunged into Satisfy.\n\nIn the depths of Hell, something waited for him.\n\n—*Finally ready to begin?*\n\nBaal lounged against his throne, face lost in shadow. Agnus couldn't make out his expression, yet somehow he *knew*. The demon was smiling. Grinning at him. Mocking him. Here to watch him twist in his own delusions.\n\nAgnus knew all this.\n\nHe used the skill anyway.\n\n\"Deceased Creation.\"\n\nThe ultimate ability. Grid had Item Creation. Kraugel had Swordsmanship Creation. And Agnus? Agnus could reshape death itself.\n\nSystem prompts cascaded across his vision. Each one a formality. Each one another step toward—\n\n\"I want to create... Luna Caroline...\"\n\nHis hands clutched the portrait so tightly the frame groaned. Tears blurred everything. The words caught in his throat.\n\nThe system didn't ask if he wanted to *resurrect* her.\n\nIt asked if he wanted to *create* her.\n\n*You are not bringing back your lover. You are constructing a body that resembles her. These are not the same thing.*\n\n*This body will have no memories of you. No warmth. No recognition.*\n\n*Rotting filth will flow through its veins, not hot blood.*\n\n*Hatred will beat in its heart, not love.*\n\n*Remember this: What you create is not who you lost.*\n\nEach warning struck like a blade to the chest.\n\n\"I want to create... Luna Caroline.\" The words finally broke free. \"I'll make her.\"\n\nMiracles and atrocities are often indistinguishable.\n\nThe materials he'd gathered—the Stone of Life, dark elf corpses, blood and bone fragments—rose from the altar in a swirling vortex. Black light erupted. Death took shape.\n\n\"Ah... *Ahhh*...\"\n\nReason fled. Sanity shattered. Agnus seized the corpse that wore his lover's face and pulled it close.\n\n\"Luna...\"\n\nShe said nothing.\n\n[WARNING: Degraded material detected among creation components.]\n\n[Created deceased will be rated below standard grade.]\n\n[Your creation 'Luna Caroline' has been assigned RARE rating.]\n\n[Low rating has severely diminished 'Luna Caroline's' cognitive function.]\n\n[Low rating has resulted in an extremely fragile physical form.]\n\nA barrage of notifications. Every single one delivering bad news.\n\nAgnus didn't see them.\n\n*His* Luna was the most precious thing in any world. How dare the system try to quantify her worth?\n\n—*Humans excel at one thing above all else: running from reality.*\n\nOn his throne, Baal laughed without humor.\n\n***\n\nWrithing tentacles erupted from the forest floor. Autumn leaves burst into flames mid-fall. Flowers released noxious stenches that numbed the senses and choked the lungs.\n\n\"Break formation if you don't want to get grabbed! Spread out!\"\n\n\"We'll get picked off by arrows if we scatter!\"\n\nLightning God Kyle's invasion force plunged into the World Tree's forest and immediately found themselves drowning. Hundreds of elves, concealed in the massive trees, maintained an unrelenting barrage. The Sword Knights could do nothing but raise shields and parry desperately.\n\n\"Hah... hah...\"\n\nResh, a mere foot soldier in this grand army, already bled from half a dozen wounds. He'd earned the title of high ranker—cleared hidden quests alongside Grid and Coke, rocketed to level 367. Here, in this nightmare forest, he was *nothing*. The elves perched in those ancient trees matched or exceeded his level. Every single one of them.\n\n*The main army's different. Kyle must be panicking by now.*\n\nResh barely deflected an arrow aimed at his eye and scanned the battlefield. His fellow knights were pinned down. Even Dulandal's elite forces, supposedly the empire's finest, were helpless against this fortress that nature herself had spent millennia perfecting.\n\n*We can't break through. Not like this.*\n\nThorned vines created impenetrable walls. Dense undergrowth transformed every step into a battle. The massive trees formed ramparts that dwarfed any human construction. The beasts that prowled those wooden battlements were larger than most monsters. The elves upon them were master archers.\n\nWhat force in the world could overcome this through brute strength alone?\n\n*The former emperor didn't imprison the elves here. He just couldn't get in.*\n\nEven the legendary Red Knights had understood that invading this place meant suicide. Resh's lips curved into a grim smile.\n\n*You fucked up, Kyle.*\n\nKyle's decision to crush the elves through overwhelming force was textbook hubris. These opponents made the senior knight Kyle had murdered look like an amateur. He'd ignored centuries of wisdom, and reality would punish him for it. When Dulandal learned of this failure—\n\nYes. Everything would correct itself. Kyle's defeat would reveal the elves' true power to the world. The other kingdoms would abandon thoughts of conquest. They'd seek diplomacy instead. True cooperation.\n\nResh had become a knight to defend justice. He'd hoped, *prayed* that the only enemies he'd face would be ones that deserved the sword. He didn't want to kill these beautiful, powerful people.\n\nBut—\n\nHe didn't surrender to their arrows either.\n\nSword and shield worked in desperate harmony. He might despise this battle, but he'd survive to its end. He had to document Kyle's brutality. Record every knight victimized by this madness.\n\nThen, between one heartbeat and the next, everything changed.\n\nLightning streaked past Resh's cheek. An ancient tree *detonated*.\n\n\"*Aaagh!*\"\n\nThree elves died before they could scream.\n\n\"...?!\"\n\nResh spun around. Kyle stood behind him, perfectly composed. No surprise in his expression. He'd *expected* this.\n\n\"I was hoping to conserve strength, but I suppose I'll lend you a hand.\"\n\nElectricity erupted from Kyle's entire body. Waves of crackling energy—rivaling Magician King Goldhit's most devastating spells—radiated outward in all directions, saturating the forest in an instant. Beasts fell mid-charge. Tentacle-wielding plants seized and died. Archers tumbled from their perches, muscles locked in paralysis.\n\nMass paralysis. It resembled the Blue Dragon Grid had summoned, but faster. More efficient. More *absolute*.\n\n\"Why that expression? You look like you're watching the sunset.\" Kyle addressed the stunned knights as hundreds of elves crashed to the forest floor. \"They're easier to kill while they can't move, you know.\"\n\n\"Ugh...\" \n\nThe knights approached the fallen elves with visible reluctance. Raising weapons against helpless opponents violated every principle of their order.\n\n*They're enemies.*\n\n*If we don't kill them, they'll kill us.*\n\nReason had no place in war. The knights had no choice.\n\nThey gripped their swords, avoiding the poisoned glares of the paralyzed elves. A massacre was about to begin.\n\nThen—\n\n\"A knight must act with honor!\" Someone shouted words from an ancient vow. \"You must not strike down those who cannot resist! Not even on the battlefield!\"\n\nKnight Resh's voice cut through the carnage.\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe chivalric code was full of impractical ideals. Dead knights had written it, knights who'd sacrificed everything for those impossible standards. Most people mocked it as inefficient fantasy.\n\nBut every true knight had taken up the sword *because* of those beautiful, impossible ideals.\n\n\"...\"\n\nFor a heartbeat—less than a full second—hundreds of knights froze.\n\nThen reality reasserted itself.\n\n\"*Kyaaah!*\"\n\n\"*Gkk!*\"\n\n\"*Nngh...*\"\n\nBlades rose and fell. Steel pierced flesh. They killed the elves who couldn't fight back. They slaughtered them.\n\nYears had passed since they'd taken their oaths. Survival mattered more than ideals. They'd known hunger. Experienced dozens of near-death encounters. They had families depending on them.\n\nMost of all...\n\n\"The master's command supersedes the chivalric code.\"\n\nThe final verse of their vows gave them permission to betray everything else.\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nDeath cries echoed through the forest.\n\nRed blood soaked the soil and painted the bark. Tears mixed with hatred in this once-sacred place.\n\nResh stared at the butchery, paralyzed by horror.\n\n\"Resh! Snap out of it! We'll die if we don't fight!\" His fellow knights forced a sword into his trembling hand.\n\nResh was a good man. They didn't hate their youngest member for still believing in justice the way they once had. In quieter moments, they even wished he could stay that way forever.\n\nBut reality demanded compromise. They had to make Resh participate in the massacre. If he refused, Kyle would execute him for insubordination.\n\n\"Resh! *Now!*\"\n\nKyle drew closer with every passing moment. That burning gaze fixed directly on Resh's back. The desperate knights pleaded, but Resh remained frozen. Lost in existential crisis.\n\n*Why am I here? Why am I doing this?*\n\nHe'd started playing Satisfy to live out childhood fantasies—to be the knights from the movies he'd loved. Games were supposed to be *fun*. Entertainment. So why? Why did every session turn into *this*?\n\n*Should I just quit?*\n\nResh ground his teeth as Kyle's presence loomed directly behind him.\n\nA hand wreathed in electricity reached for his neck.\n\n\"First a heretic, now a traitor? This organization needs purging.\"\n\n\"*Shut the fuck up!*\"\n\nResh's rage erupted. Geon's face flashed in his memory—the senior knight who'd mentored him for years before Kyle murdered him for being a 'heretic.' Roaring, Resh channeled everything he had into a desperate backward slash.\n\nNaturally, it was hopeless. Kyle was beyond duke-level. One player's wild swing wouldn't even make him flinch. Kyle sidestepped the clumsy attack and released his lightning.\n\n\"Weakness is sin.\"\n\nKyle followed the War God's teachings—a fact unknown to most. He believed in strength as the ultimate truth.\n\n*If Grid were here, maybe he could've exposed this bastard's weaknesses...*\n\nThe thought should've been Resh's last. Kyle's lightning should've killed him instantly.\n\n\"...?\"\n\nSo why was he still breathing?\n\nConfusion. Then recognition.\n\nA figure stood between them—someone Resh had never seen before. Long white hair cascaded past her waist. Heavy plate armor covered her frame. A massive shield absorbed Kyle's attack while a sword rested in a perfect guard stance.\n\nA knight. More than that—a knight more honorable than anyone else in this blood-soaked forest.\n\n\"Mercedes...?\"\n\n\"Your conviction is admirable.\" Her voice rang clear and beautiful above the carnage. Lightning crackled harmlessly against her shield as she swung the White Tiger Sword, shearing through Kyle's hair with surgical precision.\n\n\"You dare—!\"\n\nKyle began his counterattack, then froze. That armor—red armor from two generations past, now an antique. Three more armored knights dropped from the canopy alongside Mercedes. A blond man in a blue cloak landed beside them.\n\n\"What's this? Decided to pay the World Tree a social call? Then what's with all the corpses?\"\n\n\"Little Mercedes. Did you plan this?\"\n\n\"Pure coincidence.\"\n\nThe red-armored knights conversed casually, as if the surrounding battlefield didn't exist. No fear. No tension. \n\nKyle, on the other hand, had gone very still. Because of one specific presence.\n\n\"Electric Eel Kyle. You've gotten stronger since we last met.\"\n\n\"*Asmophel*...!\"\n\nThe former Red Knights who'd led the empire's golden age had arrived—the legendary single-digit knights."
