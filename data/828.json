  "content": "Youngwoo stared at the glowing results of his enhancement attempt, his jaw clenched so tight his teeth ached. The ancient scrolls—those precious, irreplaceable ancient scrolls—were supposed to enhance items anywhere from +1 to +3. Both his Enlightenment Sword and Valhalla of Infinite Affection had crawled to the bare minimum: +1.\n\nThe lowest possible result. Of course.\n\nHe forced himself to back away from the enhancement interface before he did something stupid like waste another scroll. The remaining ones would have to wait. Maybe his luck stat would cooperate next time. Maybe.\n\nEach enhancement level boosted an item's base stats by 5%—a number that sounded small until you remembered his myth-rated gear had base stats exceeding 1,000. One level could mean dozens, even hundreds of points in attack or defense. And he'd just fumbled two of them.\n\nWorse, he doubted he'd ever see those scrolls again. The giant cave cricket that dropped them wasn't some standard hunt—it was a walking catastrophe. No flashy skills, no elaborate magic. Just raw, crushing power. Piaro and Mercedes had barely survived their encounter with it. If he'd drawn its aggro during that fight, he'd be staring at a death penalty right now.\n\nWhich made it all the more galling to waste the rewards.\n\n\"Umm...\" He looked across the table at the man sitting in his family's modest dining room. \"Why is someone like you...?\"\n\nChairman Lim Cheolho of the S.A. Group. In his house. At his birthday party.\n\nYoungwoo's mind scrambled for explanations. Hidden camera show? Some elaborate PR stunt? The man only appeared in magazines and business news segments, not random apartments in Seoul.\n\n\"Is this a hidden camera thing?\"\n\nBut even as he asked, excitement crept in. Maybe the S.A. Group had prepared some gift to reward his performance at the National Competition. Maybe something good enough to make up for those botched enhancements?\n\nHe probably looked like an eager kid. His family wasn't any better, all of them staring at their unexpected guest with barely contained wonder.\n\nLim Cheolho shifted under the weight of those expectant gazes. He'd sat across from presidents and world leaders without breaking a sweat, yet this ordinary family made him profoundly uncomfortable. Disappointing them felt impossible.\n\n\"Ahem.\" He cleared his throat, breaking the silence. \"First of all, happy birthday. I'm honored to meet a player of your caliber in person, Grid. I'm a huge fan.\"\n\nHe meant it. Lim Cheolho respected all of Satisfy's players, but certain ones stood out. The Five Miracles, especially—those unpredictable anomalies even Morpheus couldn't calculate. They gave him a satisfaction no amount of money could buy.\n\n\"Ah...\" Youngwoo's face flushed. His heart hammered against his ribs. After years of scraping by at the bottom, of being a disappointment—to be acknowledged like this, by someone who stood at the pinnacle of the world...\n\nHis mind went blank with joy.\n\nHis parents weren't much better. This famous man, this genius entrepreneur, had come to their home to celebrate their son. To call himself a fan. It felt surreal.\n\n\"Hehe.\"\n\n\"Hum hum.\"\n\nYerim and Toon watched the scene with warm smiles, clearly enjoying the moment. Lim Cheolho felt the pressure mounting with every passing second.\n\nHe pulled out a handkerchief, dabbing at the sweat on his forehead. How was he supposed to ask Grid to return the ancient scrolls now?\n\nBefore he could figure it out, Youngwoo's mother set a bowl of rice in front of him. \"Please eat.\"\n\nShe was aware of his busy schedule—she'd cut the birthday cake right after he finished a quick meal.\n\nLim Cheolho noticed her darkened, work-worn fingernails. \"Are you still farming?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nEveryone in South Korea knew the story. Youngwoo's parents grew and sold their own vegetables, even now.\n\n\"Why continue when your son's doing so well? Couldn't you hire help? Or retire?\"\n\n\"Our son's success is his own. We can't spend what he's earned—we're not old enough to stop working yet.\"\n\nBut there was more to it than that. Both parents remembered the difficult years, when they'd doubted their son, when they'd offered no support during his struggles. The guilt weighed on them constantly. Now they threw themselves into charity work in Youngwoo's name—sending vegetables to orphanages and nursing homes, trying to shield him from jealousy and repay a debt they felt they could never settle.\n\nFor his part, Youngwoo felt like a criminal. He'd been the one causing problems, never earning praise. His parents had paid for his university despite everything, and he'd wasted it, drowning himself in debt instead. Yet his mother had still made him breakfast every single day. His father had never turned his back on him. They'd done more than enough, waiting patiently for him to find his way.\n\nAnd now they felt guilty?\n\nIf he'd been even half as good as Sehee, they wouldn't carry this shadow over their hearts.\n\nThe warm atmosphere curdled into awkward silence. Lim Cheolho felt like he was sitting on hot coals. Yerim and Toon's stares practically screamed: *Why did you have to say that?*\n\n\"Ahem.\" When had he last felt such naked resentment? Lim Cheolho forced a smile, trying to salvage the moment. He took a spoonful of rice.\n\nWords weren't needed. Parents and children—in the end, they'd understand each other. They'd find their way to happiness together.\n\n\"This is delicious.\" He couldn't remember the last homemade meal he'd eaten. Thirty-three years, perhaps. Since his parents died.\n\nHis expression softened as he ate the rice and seaweed soup. *They've shown me such warmth. I should return it.*\n\nHe'd created Satisfy with pure intentions—to give people joy their harsh realities denied them. A world beyond a game. And now he'd come here to impose constraints for the sake of game balance? To forcibly strip away happiness someone had earned through suffering?\n\nHow had he become so rigid?\n\nChairman Lim Cheolho set down his spoon. \"Overgeared King Grid.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Let me give you a small hint. The reason you've grown so much—it's not because you're Pagma's Descendant.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nYoungwoo blinked. That made no sense. Becoming Pagma's Descendant had changed everything.\n\nLim Cheolho read his confusion. \"The NPCs—treating the people in Satisfy as actual people, not programs. That's what made you who you are.\"\n\nWould the Overgeared Kingdom exist without the talented individuals beside Grid? Impossible. He wasn't versatile enough to have built it alone. Supporting Khan's dreams, revitalizing Piaro's spirit, meeting Rabbit—those connections had forged the Overgeared King.\n\n\"Don't lose sight of your foundations.\" Chairman Lim Cheolho stood, pulling on his coat. He had no intention of intruding on their family celebration any longer. He handed Youngwoo a large gift box—travel vouchers for his parents—and added one more thing. \"You've clashed with the Blacksmith God several times.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"Consider that there may be a connection to Pagma's Descendant's class quests.\"\n\nA significant hint. A *huge* hint. Youngwoo had been terrified to use his Divinity skill ever since the Blacksmith God's curse. This eased that burden considerably.\n\n\"Isn't that too much to give one specific player? Special treatment?\"\n\n\"Special treatment? I was simply thinking out loud.\"\n\nLim Cheolho had made his decision. Problems might arise from Grid hunting the cave cricket, from the ancient enhancement scrolls disrupting balance. But he would trust Satisfy's flow to the players themselves, the way he'd originally intended.\n\n\"A few more thoughts.\" He paused at the door, nodding to Youngwoo's parents and Sehee before leaning closer to whisper. \"Even if you become several times stronger than you are now, countless enemies exist that you can't face alone. Don't let overconfidence cost you the things you cherish.\"\n\nThe catastrophic episodes designed to crush humanity had been largely removed from Satisfy's timeline. From the players' perspective, the resulting variables were poison.\n\nThe empire's Grandmaster, for instance. He should have died to the insane dragon by now. Instead, he lived—an NPC with growth potential matching Mercedes, but without anyone to restrain his development.\n\nHow would players handle these powerful NPCs who would continue to reign, unlike the insane dragon that would only rampage temporarily before withdrawing? The question troubled Lim Cheolho as he departed.\n\nAfter the chairman left...\n\nYoungwoo turned to Toon with a smirk. \"So? Do you acknowledge me now that the S.A. Group's chairman personally celebrated my birthday?\"\n\n\"Uh. I acknowledge you.\" Toon, perfectly adapted to life in South Korea, raised his thumb in approval."
