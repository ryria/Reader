  "content": "Blood Carnival—the most notorious dark gamer syndicate on the continent. They killed without hesitation, extorted without mercy, and destroyed lives for nothing more than coin. Their victims numbered in the thousands, each nursing grudges that festered like open wounds.\n\nYet for all the hatred directed at them, Blood Carnival remained untouchable. Their strength was overwhelming, their movements unpredictable, and their base of operations a complete mystery. Many had tried to bring them down. All had failed.\n\nUntil today.\n\n\"So this is where they've been hiding.\"\n\nTom Yum stood at the base of the Dravian Mountains, her jaw tight with determination. After Blood Carnival assassinated her six months ago, she'd spent every waking moment tracking them. She'd rallied fellow victims, pooled resources, and ultimately hired Skunk—the world's premier explorer—at an exorbitant price.\n\nNow, finally, she had them.\n\nSkunk gestured toward a massive cave entrance carved into the mountainside. \"That's your way in.\"\n\nTom Yum approached, then stopped as a notification window materialized before her eyes.\n\n> [You have discovered the Lair of Insane Dragon Nevartan.]\n\nHer head snapped toward Skunk. \"A dragon's lair? You expect me to believe Blood Carnival is operating out of a *dragon's lair*?\"\n\n\"*Former* lair,\" Skunk corrected, pocketing the last of his payment. \"Nevartan's been gone for centuries. Only remnants remain. Even monsters avoid this place now—which makes it perfect for a group that values secrecy above all else.\"\n\nTom Yum studied the dark maw of the cave entrance, then turned to survey her forces. Three hundred strong. All victims of Blood Carnival's cruelty. All hungry for revenge.\n\nThe alliance represented some of the finest talent across multiple fields—warriors who'd lost fortunes, merchants whose caravans had been destroyed, adventurers who'd been murdered for their gear. Most were in their mid-200s in level. Nineteen were high rankers.\n\n*Against ordinary opponents, we'd be unstoppable. But Blood Carnival...?*\n\nShe pushed the doubt aside. This was no time for mercy or second thoughts.\n\n\"Battle formation!\" Tom Yum's voice rang out across the assembled forces. \"The moment we breach their stronghold, kill everything that moves. Show them the same mercy they showed us—*none*.\"\n\n\"About time we taught those bastards a lesson!\"\n\n\"I've been waiting months for this!\"\n\n\"Let's paint the walls with their blood!\"\n\nWeapons scraped free of scabbards. Magic crackled in the air. The alliance surged forward into the darkness.\n\nThe cave stretched deep into the mountain, its walls smooth and ancient. But as they advanced, something felt... wrong.\n\n*Where is everyone?*\n\n*Did they get tipped off?*\n\n*Did Skunk sell us out?*\n\nThe silence was oppressive. Not a single Blood Carnival member in sight.\n\n\"Hold!\" Tom Yum raised her fist, halting the advance. Her instincts screamed danger. \"Stay alert. Search every shadow, every crevice. Find me something—*anything*.\"\n\nShe couldn't afford failure. Assembling this alliance had taken everything she had. If she lost them now, she'd never get another chance.\n\nMinutes crawled by as her forces scoured the cave system.\n\n\"Commander! Over here!\"\n\nTom Yum rushed toward the shout. There, concealed behind a false wall in the deepest chamber, was a dungeon entrance.\n\nThe alliance erupted in renewed fervor.\n\n\"They're hiding like rats!\"\n\n\"Afraid to face us in the open!\"\n\n\"Let's drag them out and finish this!\"\n\n\"Forward!\" Tom Yum raised her sword high. They were three hundred strong, well-equipped, and battle-hardened. Whatever waited below, they could handle it.\n\nOr so they thought.\n\n> [You have entered the Beware Dogs dungeon.]\n> \n> [The dungeon has detected invaders and triggered a massive trap!]\n\n*Puk!*\n\n*Puuoooook!*\n\n**KWAANG!**\n\n**KWA KWA KWA KWAANG!**\n\n\"KUAAAACK!\"\n\nThe floor erupted in flames. Blades shot from hidden mechanisms in the walls. The vanguard—dozens of warriors—were cut down before they could even scream.\n\n\"Chrome Shield!\"\n\n\"Giant's Shield!\"\n\n\"Wind Curtain!\"\n\nThe experienced fighters recovered quickly, layering defensive skills to protect themselves and their comrades. Tom Yum breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n*We anticipated traps. We can handle—*\n\n**Gruruk!**\n\n**Kyaooooh!**\n\nMonsters poured from the dungeon depths. Not a scattered mob, but a coordinated *army*. They moved in formation, covered each other's weaknesses, and struck with tactical precision.\n\n*This isn't natural monster behavior...*\n\nTom Yum's eyes widened in shock.\n\n*A monster tamer? Blood Carnival has a ranker-level tamer?*\n\nThe realization hit her like cold water. Of course they did. Blood Carnival wasn't just some ragtag group of thugs—they were an organization of highly skilled unofficial rankers.\n\n\"Push through!\" Tom Yum's sword sang as she cut down monster after monster. \"Don't let them overwhelm us!\"\n\n\"Ohhh!\"\n\nThe alliance rallied. High rankers unleashed devastating skills. Warriors carved through the ranks. Mages rained destruction from the rear.\n\nSlowly, agonizingly, they ground forward.\n\n\"Hah... hah...\"\n\n\"Is that... all of them?\"\n\nThe last monster collapsed. The alliance stood among the corpses and shattered traps, exhausted but victorious. Three hundred had entered the first section.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty remained standing.\n\nThey waited, weapons ready, for Blood Carnival to emerge and finish the job while they were weakened.\n\nMinutes passed.\n\nNothing.\n\n*What the hell...?*\n\nOne of the scouts called out from the far corner. \"Commander! There's... there's another door!\"\n\nTom Yum's stomach dropped.\n\n\"This dungeon has *multiple sections*?\"\n\n\"Dammit...\"\n\nDespair rippled through the alliance. If the first section alone had cost them fifty people, what horrors waited beyond that door?\n\n\"Don't panic!\" One of the high rankers stepped forward. \"We know what to expect now. If we stay calm from the start, we'll clear the next section much easier.\"\n\nAnother nodded. \"Monster tamers have limits. The number and quality of monsters in the next section will be significantly lower—they *have* to be.\"\n\n\"Just watch for traps and stay ready for the actual Blood Carnival members to show themselves.\"\n\n\"Right! We've got this!\"\n\nBolstered by the reasoning, the alliance pressed onward.\n\nThe door opened.\n\n**Grrrrr!**\n\n**Kieeeeek!**\n\n\"W-WHAT THE—?!\"\n\nThe second section contained *more* monsters than the first. Far more. They swarmed the entrance in numbers that defied explanation.\n\n*This is impossible!*\n\n*Even dozens of monster tamers couldn't control this many!*\n\n*How can monsters of different species coordinate this perfectly?*\n\n*Just how high is this dungeon's difficulty rating?!*\n\n**Kiyaaaaaah!**\n\nThe battle resumed. Stamina that should have been recovering drained away even faster as the alliance struggled against the overwhelming tide.\n\n***\n\n> [Warning: Zone 3 of the Beware Dogs dungeon is completely destroyed!]\n> \n> [You have gained significant experience and loot as intruder reparation compensation.]\n> \n> [The survivors have broken into Zone 4.]\n> \n> [The traps and monsters placed in Zone 4 have activated.]\n\nDark leaned back in his chair, a satisfied smile on his face.\n\n\"Struggled all that way just to dig their own graves.\"\n\nA month ago, an unidentified intruder had breached Beware Dogs. The event had shaken Dark badly—his masterpiece, his pride, had proven vulnerable.\n\nNever again.\n\nHe'd spent a fortune upgrading the dungeon. New traps. Better monster coordination. Redundant security measures layered upon each other like the scales of a dragon.\n\nThe results exceeded his wildest expectations. Three hundred high-level invaders, reduced to a desperate, dying handful.\n\n\"Losing three zones hurts,\" Dark admitted, \"but the loot from your corpses will more than compensate.\"\n\nHe pulled up his status window, savoring the notification that his level had increased.\n\nThe hidden class *Dungeon Maker* granted him near-absolute authority within his domain. Here, in this place of his creation, he was practically a god.\n\n*Could even a great demon stand against me in here?*\n\nKraugel. Agnus. Grid. The so-called \"sun-grade players.\"\n\n*Fools, all of them.*\n\nDark watched the notification windows cascade as his traps and monsters tore into Zone 4.\n\n\"Now... when can I start collecting my rewards?\"\n\n***\n\n\"Shit... shit... *shit*...\"\n\nTom Yum collapsed outside the cave entrance, her armor cracked and blood seeping through a dozen wounds. She hit the ground hard, knees buckling under the weight of her failure.\n\n*The alliance... everyone... gone.*\n\nThree hundred warriors. Months of planning. All her resources, all her effort, all her *hope*—\n\nGone.\n\nThey hadn't even *seen* a single Blood Carnival member.\n\n*Revenge... I have to give up.*\n\nThe realization tasted like ash in her mouth. She'd spent months assembling that force. Recruiting each member personally. Convincing them to take the risk.\n\nAnd for what? A massacre. A complete and utter failure.\n\n*I can't do this anymore. It's over.*\n\nPride drained away, leaving only despair in its wake. Tom Yum bowed her head as hot tears spilled down her cheeks.\n\n\"Huh. No monsters at all, not even a rat. What's this person doing here?\"\n\nTom Yum's head snapped up at the voices.\n\n\"Looks like some lost woman crying. Just ignore her and head inside.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't we at least ask if she's okay?\"\n\n\"I don't help the incompetent. The weak can solve their own problems.\"\n\n\"You're disgusting.\"\n\n\"Oh? Are you actually interested in that woman?\"\n\n\"Let's just go.\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\nTwo figures emerged from the cave entrance—a black-haired man and a young boy. Tom Yum's eyes widened as recognition struck like lightning.\n\n\"G-Grid...?\"\n\n*What is HE doing here?*\n\nAccording to Skunk, Blood Carnival's base was hidden in one of the most secret, inaccessible locations on the continent. No one stumbled across this place by accident.\n\nWhich meant Grid had *sought it out*.\n\nTom Yum's hand drifted to her weapon as suspicion coiled in her gut.\n\n*Is he working with Blood Carnival?*\n\nBut then Grid's gaze fell on her, cold and assessing. He frowned.\n\n\"I'll say this once: Don't get caught up in this. Leave. Now.\"\n\nTom Yum blinked.\n\n*He knows how dangerous it is. And he's... warning me?*\n\nRelief flooded through her.\n\n*He's not with them. He must be here to fight Blood Carnival himself!*\n\nIt made sense. Blood Carnival had wronged countless people across every kingdom. The odds that they'd crossed Grid at some point were practically guaranteed.\n\n\"W-Wait!\" Tom Yum scrambled to her feet as Grid turned toward the dungeon entrance. \"It's suicide to go in there alone! You don't understand—\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nGrid's glare could have frozen fire. Tom Yum felt the air leave her lungs, crushed under the weight of his presence. His dignity stat alone was overwhelming, but combined with those harsh, merciless eyes...\n\n*Is this what it feels like to stand before a king?*\n\n\"Why is it suicide?\" Grid's voice carried an edge of genuine offense. \"Are you mocking me? Or threatening me?\"\n\n*Wait, what?*\n\nBefore Tom Yum could respond, Grid and Minor strode past her into the dungeon, disappearing into the darkness.\n\n\"A-Amazing...\"\n\nTom Yum stared after them, awestruck.\n\nA dungeon that had annihilated three hundred level-200+ users. A dungeon containing Blood Carnival's finest, including the infamous Black and White sisters. Grid knew all this—he *had* to know—and yet he walked in with nothing but a weak NPC companion.\n\n*Does he really think he can clear the entire dungeon alone and destroy Blood Carnival by himself?*\n\nThe sheer audacity of it stole her breath.\n\n*But... it's impossible. Even if he somehow breaks through the dungeon, the Black and White sisters alone...*\n\nGrid was walking to his death. Unfortunately, that was the reality. Tom Yum had experienced Blood Carnival's power firsthand.\n\nShe knew exactly what awaited him in the darkness."
