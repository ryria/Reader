  "content": "Kraugel had learned the truth through experience: Sword Saint was the ultimate combat class. At level 259—a hundred levels below his former White Swordsman peak—he was several times stronger than before. The disparity proved what history had always whispered.\n\nThe most astounding part? He hadn't reached his ceiling. Like Grid and Yura, Kraugel's class quests remained unfinished. One task loomed above all others: discover Muller's lost swordsmanship and claim it as his inheritance. With those techniques, his power would multiply exponentially.\n\nHe refused.\n\nKraugel had carved his own path to the Sword Saint title, untouched by Muller's legacy. He wouldn't let his achievements be eclipsed by a predecessor's shadow.\n\n\"That's why I sought you out.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nKirinus stood before him—the continent's supreme spearsman, a man who belonged nowhere yet returned to one place every three years. He gazed not at Empress Aria's resplendent palace, but at her grave. Five years had passed since her death.\n\n\"I knew you'd come here eventually,\" Kraugel said, bowing respectfully.\n\nKirinus studied him with penetrating eyes. \"Wrapped in absolute sword energy... You've touched the summit of the blade.\"\n\n\"Just as you've glimpsed the pinnacle of the spear. I'm asking you to teach me.\"\n\n\"The peak swordsman begs instruction?\" Kirinus's mouth quirked. \"You admit the sword is inferior to the spear?\"\n\n\"No. Sword or spear—*I'm* inferior to *you*. For now.\"\n\n\"For now.\" Kirinus's tone held amusement. \"Meaning later will be different?\"\n\nKraugel had two paths to advance his class. Inherit Muller's techniques—or defeat the greatest warriors in every discipline. At his current level, victory against masters like Kirinus was impossible. The odds weren't merely low; they were effectively zero. Which is why Kraugel had given himself three years.\n\n\"Teach me today. In three years, I'll teach you.\"\n\nKirinus barked a laugh. This unripe swordsman spoke absurdity—yet there was no malice in it. Only refreshing audacity.\n\n\"*You'll* teach *me*? Fascinating.\" His eyes glinted. \"Very well. Consider this an investment in three years from now.\"\n\n—!\n\nSilence. Kirinus's blue spear became a dot—like brushstroke on parchment. The impact hit Kraugel like a battering ram. Even with perfect defense, his body flew ten meters back.\n\n**[The impact was too great! Your perfect defense has failed!]**\n\n**[You have suffered 8,130 damage.]**\n\nBlood trickled from Kraugel's mouth as understanding dawned.\n\n'So the continental masters all possess Super Sensitivity.'\n\nWhether passive like the Sword Saint's or active like the Great Swordsman's, the skill exerted crushing pressure.\n\n'Grid... what kind of enemy are you facing right now?'\n\nKraugel's world expanded that day, his ambition blazing brighter. Hao and Alexander, witnessing from the sidelines, felt the same transformation. A single exchange had taught them more than months of grinding.\n\n***\n\nThe moment the world message appeared, media outlets scrambled for information about the Behen Archipelago. Speed meant exclusivity. Within hours, the public learned the basics: the Hall of Fame where legends passed down their power. \n\nBut something had changed. Even top-hundred rankers found its difficulty brutal. It offered one of the few passages to the East Continent. Rumors claimed Damian and elite rankers had all failed.\n\nSo who had reached the final gateway?\n\nThe question dominated headlines. Speculation ran rampant, with one name rising above all others: Kraugel, the sky above the sky.\n\nGrid, Agnus, and Ares had demonstrated inhuman skill during the Belto War, but Kraugel overshadowed them all. He'd defeated Grid as a mere Normal Class. Now, as a Sword Saint? He must be leagues beyond the other three.\n\n'If only they knew,' the Overgeared members thought, watching the news broadcasts with barely contained laughter. Kraugel had already failed the archipelago. Grid was the mystery player. The revelation would spark chaos.\n\nThey didn't realize the truth themselves—capturing the Behen Archipelago meant far more than they could imagine.\n\n***\n\n**[You have entered the 66th island.]**\n\n**[You deserve praise for reaching this place.]**\n\n**[Give rest to the last remaining hero...]**\n\n\"Interesting phrasing,\" Grid muttered.\n\nThe guardian was described as the last hero. Even transformed into a death knight, the legend apparently suffered.\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\nThe island puzzled him. Flat ground stretched in all directions—no cover, no terrain advantages. Nothing but an empty stage.\n\n—*A place where cheap tricks won't work.*\n\nBraham's voice confirmed his suspicion.\n\n\"Pure combat only...\" Grid's jaw tightened. \"Madra's stage, isn't it?\"\n\n—*Correct. He was the ultimate warrior before he became a master strategist. For someone who could achieve perfect victory on any terrain, a variable-free arena is merely preference.*\n\n'Genius? Ultimate? Perfect? Braham's actually praising someone...?'\n\nBraham rated Madra alongside Muller and Mumud.\n\nGrid exhaled slowly, heart hammering. Fear? Yes. Did he want to flee? Not even slightly. The prospect of facing such an opponent filled him with something he hadn't felt in ages—genuine excitement.\n\nSince claiming his First King title and surging in power, Grid hadn't been pushed to his limits. He'd found no worthy opponents, even in the archipelago.\n\n'I wish I could've fought the First Knight. Even knowing I'd lose.'\n\nBut fighting Mercedes would doom the Overgeared Kingdom. This was different. No external consequences. Just pure combat, with rewards as the prize.\n\n'If I can measure myself here, it'll help at the National Competition.'\n\nThe third National Competition was scheduled three months out. One goal dominated his mind: defeat Kraugel. To meet that day in perfect condition, he needed battles like this.\n\n*Step.*\n\n*Step, step.*\n\nThe death knight approached in majestic armor, each movement radiating power despite the skeletal frame beneath.\n\n'A sword... I expected the ultimate warrior to use multiple weapons.'\n\nThe name **MADRA** floated in gold letters above the death knight's helm. He carried an ordinary longsword—simple, unremarkable—and regarded Grid with eyes burning purple.\n\n\"One hundred years since a human guest arrived.\" Madra's voice carried surprising clarity. \"Pagma died. My power waned. The great demon invasions ended.\"\n\n\"...!\" Grid's breath caught. He'd expected intelligence, not perfect speech.\n\n\"You defeated the halflings guarding the previous islands?\"\n\n\"Halflings?\" Grid frowned. \"Everyone except Lantier.\"\n\n\"I see...\"\n\n*Halflings*—Madra called the legendary death knights *halflings*! What did that make him?\n\n'This might be harder than I thought.'\n\nGrid's grin widened. Madra continued his assessment, then nodded.\n\n\"Ah, Pagma's fault. Their names were legendary once, but death diminished them. Without Pagma's power, they couldn't function properly. Still, you impressed me. To wound even weakened halflings means you're a legend yourself... Hm?\" \n\nMadra tilted his head, confusion apparent.\n\n\"Armed with a sword, yet you're not the peak swordsman. You carry a hybrid vampire's soul but lack corresponding magic power. Your dignity reads as a king's, though...\"\n\nA legend who'd reached the 66th island, but defied categorization. Not swordsman, not magician. Only the dignity stat stood out clearly. Finally, Madra asked directly:\n\n\"What do you call yourself?\"\n\n\"Call myself...\"\n\nShin Youngwoo? Grid? Pagma's Descendant? All were true, but more than anything—\n\n\"Overgeared King. I am the Overgeared King.\"\n\n\"Overgeared King? Hoh!\" Madra's interest sparked. A fellow legend and king. Kinship stirred. \"Tell me—what does *overgeared* signify?\"\n\nMadra had never tasted defeat, earning his title as the Undefeated King. What made this human \"overgeared\"? Childlike curiosity colored his tone.\n\nGrid considered his answer, then summoned the God Hands. Golden appendages materialized, each gripping a Mjolnir.\n\n\"Hoh?\"\n\n\"Overgeared means making supreme use of these tools,\" Grid explained as Madra stared at the autonomous golden hands. \"That's why I'm called the Overgeared King.\"\n\n*Supreme?* Anyone who knew Grid would call him shameless. But only Grid, Braham, and Madra occupied this island. Madra didn't know any better.\n\n\"I see. Exceptional equipment mastery... Wait.\" Madra frowned. Every legend possessed that ability. It was fundamental. This human presented a universal trait as though it were unique talent.\n\n\"Are you mocking me?\" Madra's tone cooled. \"No matter. Keep your secrets before battle—that's reasonable enough.\"\n\nThe conversation ended.\n\n\"You came to purify this now-useless archipelago. To cleanse it, you must defeat me. As a death knight, I exist to repel all intruders. Battle is inevitable.\" \n\n*Crack!*\n\n\"Whether living or dead—I have *never* known defeat.\"\n\n\"...!\"\n\nMadra's voice came from beside him, though he'd stood ten paces ahead a heartbeat ago. The death knight before him vanished. Grid understood too late.\n\n**[You have suffered 11,200 damage.]**\n\n\"Kuk...!\"\n\nPain lanced through his side. Madra's footwork matched Garam's transcendent speed. The Undefeated King had ruled his era, defended the archipelago, and remained unbroken even after death diminished him twice—once through transformation, once through Pagma's demise.\n\n\"100,000 Army Massacre Sword.\"\n\n*Chukak.*\n\n*Chukakakakak!*\n\nHis majesty remained absolute. The technique struck twice as fast as Pagma's Link, carving Grid's body forty times per second."
