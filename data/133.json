No corporation in human history commanded such wealth or influence.\n\nSouth Korea depended on them. Limited land, scarce resources—the jobs and charity programs S.A. provided kept the economy afloat. Yesterday, the government had returned with another request.\n\n---\n\nThe conference room occupied the top floor of S.A. Group's Seoul headquarters. Yoon Sangmin stood before a wall-mounted display, his presentation slides casting blue light across the assembled executives.\n\n\"The government's proposal is straightforward.\" He clicked to the next slide. \"Invite the top 100 Satisfy rankers to South Korea. Organize them into national teams. Host competitions—raids, pet marathons, other events. The Korean government handles logistics. We handle planning, promotion, and sponsorships.\"\n\nAn executive near the back crossed his arms. \"Another favor for the government? What are we, a charity?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" The woman beside him nodded. \"Any company or broadcaster can host Satisfy tournaments. Why should we foot the bill?\"\n\nA third voice joined the chorus. \"And bringing them here physically? The top rankers are obsessed with leveling. You'd need hundreds of billions of won just to pry them away from their capsules for a weekend.\"\n\nYoon Sangmin waited for the complaints to die down. He'd expected resistance. Director Yoon knew how to play his hand.\n\n\"Consider the format. National competition.\" He let the words hang. \"The Olympics. The World Cup. These events transcend sports. Even with traditional athletics declining due to Satisfy's dominance, Olympic viewership remains strong. Now imagine that scale, but for a game one-third of humanity already plays.\"\n\nKim Jiyoung, the South Korean branch manager, leaned forward in her chair. \"The offline component is crucial. Stage greetings. Awards ceremonies at Olympic Stadium. Put famous faces on that stage and suddenly we're reaching demographics who dismiss Satisfy as 'just a game.' It becomes real to them.\"\n\nPresident Lee Hoonyi smiled, his fingers steepled. \"Rankers are celebrities. They'll draw crowds. Ticket sales won't be an issue. International tourists will flood Seoul to see multiple top players in one venue. Then there's broadcasting rights. Each country will pay premium rates for the coverage.\" His smile widened. \"That's what the government sees. Profit.\"\n\nLim Cheolho, chairman and final authority, spoke with quiet satisfaction. \"National rankings. Country versus country. Patriotism channeled through Satisfy.\" He nodded slowly. \"An elegant use of the platform.\"\n\nThe atmosphere shifted. Dissent crumbled.\n\nKim Jiyoung drove the point home. \"This becomes annual. We start small, expand the format each year, introduce events unique to Satisfy's mechanics. In a decade, the Satisfy National Competition rivals the Olympics in prestige.\"\n\nLee Hoonyi clapped his hands together. \"Money's not a concern. The returns will justify any investment.\"\n\nAll eyes turned to Lim Cheolho. The chairman gave a single nod.\n\n\"Inform the government. Request approved.\"\n\nYoon Nahee raised her hand. As head of operations, she rarely spoke during executive meetings, but when she did, people listened. Even her brother Yoon Sangmin straightened in his seat.\n\n\"We have problems to solve first.\"\n\nYoon Sangmin gestured for her to continue.\n\n\"Balance.\" Nahee pulled up a data sheet. \"If we divide the top 100 by nationality, the distribution is a disaster. Twenty-three Americans. Two Koreans. The gap's too wide for fair competition.\"\n\n\"Limit it to the top thirty?\" someone suggested.\n\n\"That eliminates most participating countries. Too small to call it a world event.\"\n\nMurmurs of concern rippled through the room.\n\n\"We can't restrict it to rankers only,\" another executive said. \"Better to scout talent for specific events, like traditional sports do.\"\n\n\"The logistics would be a nightmare. Sorting two billion users by country, evaluating their skills across multiple categories, conducting tryouts. It'd take forever.\"\n\n\"Besides, the first competition needs star power. Rankers drive interest. Who cares about unknowns?\"\n\nYoon Nahee waited for the noise to settle before dropping her second bomb.\n\n\"Also, at 23:55 yesterday, Yura hit level 280.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nThen excitement.\n\n\"Already?\" An executive whistled. \"That makes five in the top ranks past 280?\"\n\n\"Excellent news for Korea. Our gaming reputation's been suffering lately.\"\n\n\"Takes me back. When I was young, Korean teams dominated every tournament...\"\n\n\"Wait.\" Yoon Sangmin's frown cut through the enthusiasm. \"Isn't this concerning? The rankers are leveling too fast.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" Another executive shuffled through his documents. \"Check your reference materials. Morpheus predicted we wouldn't see a level 280 user for another two months.\"\n\n\"Morpheus missed the mark again? How many times now?\"\n\n\"This is serious.\"\n\nThe room grew tense. Three specific thresholds defined Satisfy's progression: levels 210, 240, and 270. Players called them the 'hell sections'—exponential experience requirements that should have throttled advancement. The top rankers ignored those barriers like they didn't exist.\n\n\"Is Morpheus compromised?\" someone asked. \"Could be a virus.\"\n\n\"We might need a complete system overhaul.\"\n\nYoon Nahee shook her head. \"Morpheus is functioning correctly. The top rankers simply exceed our initial projections. The issue isn't the system—it's that we underestimated human potential. Adjust the parameters, recalibrate the error margins, and Morpheus will track accurately going forward.\"\n\n\"Underestimated? By how much?\"\n\n\"Significantly.\" Nahee brought up another chart. \"The top thirty aren't just skilled—they're anomalies. Their understanding of game mechanics, their combat instincts, they operate on a different cognitive level. They're clearing content we designed to be borderline impossible and treating it as routine farming. Consider Regas: he's ranked in the top thirty despite hunting exclusively with his bare hands. No weapons at all.\"\n\nYoon Sangmin grimaced. \"Taekwon Master Regas? He's still doing that nonsense?\"\n\nMartial Artists had built-in advantages that reduced weapon dependency. Their skills featured high base damage and defense penetration. Even so, the weapon restrictions were deliberate—they could only equip knuckles, the weakest weapon category in the game. Most Martial Artists at least used basic knuckles to supplement their skills.\n\nNot Regas. He'd never equipped a weapon since character creation. The development team had been monitoring him for months, baffled by his dedication to the handicap.\n\n\"Taekwondo purist,\" someone muttered.\n\nRegas—real name Roald Hoffmann, born in London, Olympic gold medalist in Taekwondo—had somehow integrated real-world martial arts philosophy into Satisfy's combat system. His refusal to use weapons stemmed from a belief that doing so violated the spirit of Taekwondo itself.\n\n\"It's borderline psychotic,\" Yoon Sangmin said.\n\n\"True. But why bring up Regas after mentioning Yura's level?\"\n\n\"What's the connection?\"\n\nYoon Nahee pulled up a projection graph. \"At current progression rates, the top five reach level 300 in approximately three months. Which means third advancement.\"\n\nUnderstanding dawned.\n\nFive months ago, the first wave of second advancement users had emerged. Back then, fewer than a hundred players out of two billion had crossed the level 200 threshold. The top five rankers had been around level 230.\n\nNow? Over a thousand players had achieved second advancement. The top five were knocking on level 300's door.\n\n\"If we're hosting,\" Nahee continued, \"preparation and promotion require a minimum three-month window.\"\n\n\"Which means third advancement users during the competition,\" an executive said slowly.\n\n\"Game over. The power gap between second and third advancement is massive. Any match with that disparity becomes boring—the outcome's predetermined.\"\n\n\"Third advancement skill trees rival hidden classes. The entire tier is deliberately overtuned...\"\n\nThe design philosophy made sense. Regular advancement classes needed something to compete with the hidden class users, or risk alienating the majority of the player base. Third advancement was the equalizer. But it also meant anyone below that threshold became irrelevant in direct competition.\n\nYoon Sangmin rubbed his temples. \"Can we accelerate the timeline? Hold the competition sooner?\"\n\n\"We can throw money and manpower at the preparation phase, compress it somewhat,\" Nahee admitted. \"But global promotion requires at least three months. Anything less and we don't reach critical mass for viewership.\"\n\nBranch Manager Kim Jiyoung straightened. \"In-game quests.\"\n\nEveryone turned.\n\n\"Forget restricting this to rankers,\" Kim Jiyoung said, her words gaining momentum. \"Deploy quests to all two billion users. Structure them as announcements for the national competition—built-in advertising. Encourage participation through quest rewards. Monitor player performance across the quest activities and use that data to identify representatives for each event category.\"\n\nShe spread her hands. \"Shortens the promotion cycle. Automates participant selection. Builds grassroots investment in the competition's success.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nThen unanimous approval. Nods and murmurs of agreement filled the room.\n\nLim Cheolho's expression was unreadable, but his voice carried approval. \"Make it happen.\"\n\n---\n\nThe Dominion Church's sanctum smelled of incense and old stone. A priest approached the praying form of Leader Rhonda, his footsteps echoing in the vaulted chamber.\n\n\"Leader, someone requests God Dominion's blessing.\"\n\nRhonda's meditation broke. \"At this hour? One of our faithful?\"\n\n\"That's... no.\"\n\nRhonda turned, confusion giving way to irritation. The blessing of a god wasn't some casual favor handed to tourists. It was a sacred ritual performed once yearly for a carefully chosen believer. Now a stranger demanded it?\n\n*The audacity.*\n\nThe priest must have sensed Rhonda's displeasure. He added quickly, \"He's accompanied by the first paladin of the Judar Church. He also carries a letter of recommendation from Isabel, one of Rebecca's Daughters.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\nThat changed things. The elite of two rival churches vouching for one person? Rhonda stood, curiosity overriding annoyance.\n\nThe man waiting in the antechamber had ordinary features—black hair, East Asian, stubborn set to his mouth and eyes. Not particularly imposing at first glance. But something in those eyes caught Rhonda's attention. Determination, perhaps. Or something deeper.\n\n*Strange.*\n\nThen Rhonda noticed the faint luminescence surrounding the man. Not visible light, exactly. More like an impression of radiance, perceptible only to those attuned to divine energies.\n\nThe Judar Church's first paladin stepped forward. Toban was a seasoned warrior, his bearing professional. \"Leader Rhonda, this is Grid. He helped defeat Malacus, the Sixth Servant of Yatan. He also killed Pope Drevigo, who corrupted the Rebecca Church. The Goddess herself named him her agent.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nThe glow made sense now. Grid already carried Rebecca's blessing. No wonder the sanctum's ambient holy power reacted to his presence.\n\nRhonda bowed. \"It's an honor, Mister Grid.\"\n\nBehind him, Toban's jaw dropped. *I followed Grid's script for the introduction, but to be received like this?* Religious leaders commanded respect that transcended national borders. Tens of millions of believers. Even kings deferred to them. Yet here was Rhonda bowing to a player?\n\nGrid didn't waste time on pleasantries. \"I need God Dominion's blessing on an item.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nThe ceremony took an hour. Dozens of believers formed a prayer circle while Rhonda performed the rites. Divine light gathered, coalesced, and sank into the two golden discs Grid presented.\n\n> **[God Dominion's blessing has fallen on the pavranium.]**\n>\n> **[The attack power of the pavranium has been strengthened.]**\n\nGrid pulled up the item window.\n\n> **[Golden Discs Made of Pavranium]**\n> \n> **Durability:** Infinite\n>\n> Golden discs made of pavranium, the strongest mineral produced by the collaboration between the legendary blacksmith Pagma and the legendary great magician Braham.\n>\n> By default, they revolve around and protect their owner. They will also take other actions when given commands.\n>\n> * They have obtained healing skills due to Goddess Rebecca's blessing. They will increase their owner's health recovery speed by **300%**.\n> \n> * They have obtained an attack buff skill due to God Dominion's blessing. The owner's attack power will increase by **15%**.\n>\n> **Weight:** 3\n\nGrid's breath caught. He'd suffered through Rebecca's trials expecting similar ordeals for each blessing. Instead, the Dominion Church quest had been straightforward, and the reward was perfect.\n\n*Two down.*\n\n\"Alright.\" Grid dismissed the window. \"Next is the Judar Church.\"\n\n\"J-Judar Church?\" Toban went pale.\n\nGrid raised an eyebrow. \"Problem?\"\n\n\"Grid, I... I can't go back to the Judar Church.\" Panic crept into Toban's voice. \"My quest from the leader—I was supposed to retrieve the Holy Light set from you. If I return empty-handed...\"\n\nToban explained the situation in detail, words tumbling over each other. His mission. His failure. The consequences.\n\nGrid listened without expression. When Toban finished, Grid's response was flat.\n\n\"I don't care about your reasons. What does that have to do with me?\" He met Toban's eyes. \"You're my slave. You follow my commands. So follow.\"\n\n\"Grid...\"\n\nThere was no mercy in that stare. But Toban had no room to protest. He'd sworn an oath. Broken it once already. Now he existed at Grid's discretion.\n\nStill, tears welled in his eyes as he nodded.\n\n---\n\n**Glossary of Common Korean Terms**\n**OG:** [Glossary Link]\n\n**Current schedule:** 20 chapters a week.\n\nCheck out my Patreon for early access to a certain number of unedited chapters and to achieve goals for extra chapters.
