  "content": "Grid allowed himself a moment of satisfaction, the weight of accomplishment settling over him like a well-fitted cloak. The production system for the Grid set was established—a feat worthy of genuine pride. What other kingdom could boast infinite item production with inexhaustible resources? The achievement deserved recognition that would echo through the ages.\n\nOf course, production would crawl at first. But that would change. More advanced blacksmiths would emerge. Additional Insane Dragon Hammers and Anvils would be secured. When that day came, their military might would surge forward at a pace that could rival even the Saharan Empire.\n\n*...No. That's wishful thinking.*\n\nThe uncomfortable truth pressed against his optimism. The West Continent's population and resources bent heavily toward the empire. They certainly possessed minerals that surpassed even insane dragon iron.\n\n*They'll have hundreds of advanced blacksmiths, too. Most top-ranking blacksmith players belong to them.*\n\nThese considerations had been irrelevant when he was just another player grinding through the game. Those days were gone. The Saharan Empire now represented a potential enemy—one whose mere existence threatened the Overgeared Kingdom. As king, Grid had an obligation to monitor that looming power. The problem? Dwelling on it crushed his morale.\n\n*Well... they're not interested in us right now. No point worrying about problems that don't exist yet.*\n\nAccording to player gossip circulating through the forums, the empire still regarded the Overgeared Kingdom as insignificant. This assessment persisted even after rumors spread that Grid had dominated the representatives of fifteen kingdoms and bent one to vassalage.\n\n*I suppose we're just minnows squabbling in a pond to them.*\n\nThe blow to his pride stung, but it presented an opportunity. While the empire's gaze remained elsewhere, the Overgeared Kingdom could build strength in the shadows. Everything hinged on Grid's personal growth—that was the foundation upon which power would be built.\n\n*I should go hunting after I finish Belial's magic sword.*\n\nHis hunger for strength ran deep. He ranked among the best players, yes—but his foundation remained too shallow for anyone to genuinely call him \"the strongest.\" Monsters and NPCs more powerful than himself still prowled the world. Naturally, he wanted to close that gap.\n\n*Those Red Knights from the empire sound terrifying.*\n\nParticularly the solo number knights. Rumors suggested they could crush Kraugel with one finger.\n\n*I'd probably die before I could blink.*\n\nA shiver ran through him. In his fear, Grid never imagined the truth: the very man he'd confined in his dungeon, Reidorn, was actually one of those infamous solo number knights.\n\n\"Grid.\"\n\nThe voice pulled him from his dark contemplation. He'd been pondering what type of magic sword to forge when an elf appeared at his workshop entrance. Sticks—recently appointed principal of the Overgeared Academy in Reinhardt.\n\nA sage. A figure of profound wisdom placed as the head of a school? Grid had initially questioned whether this represented a serious misallocation of resources. Sticks had questioned it too, but ultimately accepted the appointment. After all, Grid was his savior and the key to breaking the curse that bound the Behen Archipelago. Following Grid's wishes seemed the least he could do.\n\n\"What brings you here?\" Grid asked.\n\nThey hadn't spoken in some time. Grid's tone came out somewhat flat—not from dislike, but from discomfort. Sticks embodied the ideal of elven beauty, and standing beside him felt awkward.\n\n*I look like a squid next to this guy.*\n\nSticks spoke without attempting to diminish his luminous features. \"Great Demon Belial has been destroyed. While observing you afterward, something occurred to me. The range of items you can produce is severely limited.\"\n\n\"...!!\"\n\nThe words struck home. Grid possessed a total of 2,080 production methods. Roughly 200 he'd acquired through personal effort; the remaining 1,880 came from Overgeared members who'd shared their knowledge. For any single player, learning 2,000 production methods alone would be extraordinarily difficult. Yet here was Sticks, suggesting Grid's repertoire was inadequate.\n\nGrid couldn't deny it. Why?\n\n*Because it's true. I am limited.*\n\nSo what if he knew 2,000 production methods? More than half covered weapons and armor. The actual variety of item types he could create remained frustratingly narrow. Cloth clothing, for instance—he had no idea how to make it. He couldn't produce the robes his new position as king required in large quantities.\n\n*And I only know one way to make a crown.*\n\nThe Holy Light Crown's production method had come from achieving 100% understanding of the item itself. After earning the First King title, Grid recognized the necessity of a proper crown, but lacked the ability to craft anything worthy of the position. The Creation skill could compensate, of course—but it had strictly limited uses.\n\n*If Sticks is bringing up production methods...*\n\nThis had to be a quest!\n\n*Thump!*\n\nAnticipation sparked in Grid's eyes.\n\n\"You're absolutely right,\" he said, leaning forward. \"What I can make is extremely limited. I'm nowhere near Pagma's level yet. Can you help me with this?\"\n\n\"I'm called a sage because I possess vast knowledge. Recently, certain information surfaced in my mind regarding the culture, history, and legends of the fallen Eternal Kingdom.\"\n\n\"Information...!\"\n\nThe sage didn't disappoint. Grid felt certain this conversation served as a prelude to something significant. Right on cue, a notification window materialized before him.\n\n[A new Pagma's Descendant class quest has been created.]\n\n[Collection of New Production Methods (1)]\n\n*Class Quest*\n\n*You are the successor to Pagma's techniques, but not his true heir. The techniques you've mastered were learned from the book Pagma left behind.*\n\n*You possess techniques that could transcend legend and approach myth, but your overall knowledge remains insufficient!*\n\n*To expand your foundation as a blacksmith, you must learn various types of production methods!*\n\n*Follow the sage Sticks' clues and acquire new types of production methods.*\n\n*Quest Clear Reward: Level +2. Underwear Production Method. A following linked quest.*\n\n\"Oh...! Ohh!\"\n\nA new class quest! The first since acquiring Braham's soul!\n\n\"The reward is two levels and... learning how to make underwear? Huh?\"\n\nThe delight drained from Grid's face as if someone had pulled a plug. He turned on the innocent Sticks.\n\n\"Underwear production method? Is this some kind of joke?\"\n\n\"Humans are fascinating creatures. Your emotions shift so suddenly, unlike we elves who maintain constant equilibrium...\"\n\n\"No, this is absurd! Why would I need to learn how to make *underwear*?\"\n\nUnderwear was important, certainly. Some people avoided it for various reasons, but most wore it. The stability and cleanliness it provided couldn't be ignored. But in Satisfy, underwear served a slightly different function than in reality. It was essentially a censor—a screen preventing players from unnecessarily exposing anatomical details. The underwear Grid currently wore was simply labeled \"Underwear.\" It was the grey default item given to all male players in Satisfy, possessing zero functionality.\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nIn his agitation, Grid suddenly yanked down his pants and jabbed a finger at the underwear he'd worn daily for nine Satisfy years.\n\n\"Why should I make more of *this*?\"\n\nA blacksmith. A *legendary* blacksmith—and they wanted him to craft underwear? The outrage left him momentarily speechless. After discovering his class quest reward involved underwear production, Grid's emotions rocketed past disappointment straight into fury.\n\nThen Sticks spoke calmly. \"Are you aware that we elves also practice occupations like blacksmithing and tailoring?\"\n\n\"Of course. These professions are necessary for any species. That's how societies obtain food and clothing.\"\n\n\"Correct. While our craftsmanship doesn't surpass humans or dwarves, we do have blacksmiths and tailors among our people. One elven tailor achieved particular fame as an underwear maker. The underwear I'm currently wearing was crafted by that tailor. I've worn it for 613 years, and it remains highly functional. Excellent ventilation, constant comfort.\"\n\n\"What kind of nonsense...\"\n\nToo many things to unpack there. The quest started with a blacksmith learning underwear production, then suddenly pivoted to elven tailors? And he'd been wearing the *same underwear* for 613 years?\n\n*That's disgusting.*\n\nGrid remained oblivious to the fact that wearing the same underwear for nine years was equally revolting. Sticks pressed his explanation.\n\n\"My point is that underwear crafted with proper techniques possesses unusual functions. Grid, I believe the underwear you create will boast excellent features.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nGrid paused. Consider it—in Satisfy, underwear represented a basic item worn beneath primary equipment. What if it had specific options?\n\n*That's... actually useful.*\n\nBetter to have some defense than no functionality at all. The concept clicked: secondary defense.\n\n\"Furthermore,\" Sticks continued, \"underwear is constructed from cloth. What does producing underwear suggest? It means you'll learn to handle cloth materials. Grid, you still can't create cloth items, correct?\"\n\n\"Ah...! I see!\"\n\nMemory surfaced—creating the Hooded Zip Up and Lantier's Cloak. As a blacksmith, Grid couldn't produce cloth items and had ultimately consumed his Creation skill.\n\n*But once I learn cloth armor production, I won't need to waste Creation uses on cloak-type items anymore!*\n\nGrid's anger at the quest reward evaporated, replaced by renewed enthusiasm.\n\n*I could also make underwear as a private gift for Irene...*\n\nIrene looked especially beautiful at night. This was excellent. Grid's mind wandered to images of Irene looking even more alluring than she had in those vampire pajamas. Then Yura and Jishuka drifted into his thoughts.\n\n*I've always wondered about their exact measurements...*\n\nCould he use functional underwear as an excuse to obtain their sizes?\n\n\"Hehe.\"\n\nThe smile fixed itself to Grid's face—not greedy, but strangely pure. Sticks registered mild surprise.\n\n*He can look this innocent?*\n\nA human with an untainted soul. Observing Grid's behavior toward his peers and subordinates, Sticks could discern his fundamentally upright character. He differed from ordinary humans. The sage's fondness deepened, and he provided detailed quest information.\n\n\"Travel north. The territory Duke Steim governs. You'll find clues about the underwear craftsman there.\"\n\n\"Perfect. I'll get to see my father-in-law as well.\"\n\nGrid nodded and departed immediately. The magic sword could wait. In completing this class quest, he'd acquire new production methods and deepen his understanding of item creation.\n\n\"Huhuhut!\"\n\nWith functional underwear, he'd have opportunities to expand his item repertoire *and* learn the measurements of the world's greatest beauties! Grid was so excited that laughter kept bubbling up. Passing players stared.\n\n\"Wait. Is that Grid?\"\n\n\"No way... There's no way Grid would walk down the road with his pants pulled down...\"\n\n\"...I didn't see anything.\"\n\nFortunate that players outside the Overgeared Guild weren't particularly familiar with Grid's appearance. If they could definitively identify him, all manner of rumors would flood the internet within hours."
