  "content": "\"This uncle is adorable.\"\n\n\"T-The audacity!\"\n\nEven stripped of his ducal title, Grenhal commanded power accumulated across generations—enough to rival the finest warriors on the West Continent. Should the imperial family cast him aside, he possessed the resources to forge his own nation from his ancestral holdings. Yet this girl had the gall to prod their master's cheek with her finger? An affront beyond imagination.\n\n\"She dares touch Duke Grenhal's face...!\"\n\n\"Remove your hand this instant! Saintess' companion or not, show some basic respect!\"\n\nThe retainers' fury erupted. Hands drifted toward sword hilts as cascading notifications materialized before Yerim's vision.\n\n[You have fallen into the 'fear' state.]\n\n[You have fallen into the 'oppressed' state.]\n\n[You have fallen into the 'chaotic' state.]\n\n[The passive skill 'Defender of the Miracle' has allowed you to resist the 'fear' and 'chaotic' states.]\n\n[The effect of the passive skill 'Person Who Put a Foot in the Miracle' has reduced the duration of the 'oppression' state. Transfers the 'oppression' to the target for as long as the reduced time.]\n\n[The target has resisted.]\n\n[The target has resisted...]\n\n\"...!\" \n\nThe retainers froze. Not only did she stand her ground—she pushed back against their killing intent. This slip of a girl harbored formidable strength beneath that delicate exterior.\n\n'Remarkable talent. No wonder the Saintess keeps her close at such a young age.'\n\nThe Overgeared Kingdom had weathered the empire's assault. Small, perhaps, but mighty. Their admiration flickered briefly before righteous anger reasserted itself. Yerim stuck out her tongue, grinning. \"My apologies. This uncle's just too cute for words. Forgive my manners.\"\n\n\"Unbelievable...! You persist with this 'cute' nonsense even knowing his identity!\"\n\n\"What if I don't know who he is?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe retainers stood speechless, arguments dying on their tongues. Yerim ignored them, stroking Grenhal's scarred hand where he lay sleeping. Deep wounds marked the flesh.\n\n\"You've endured so much. It must be exhausting. Please, rest now.\"\n\n\"...\" \n\nGrenhal's eyebrows twitched. Perhaps the brutal circumstances had stripped away his defenses, because simple comfort from an unknown girl pierced straight through to his battered heart. The imperial family—to whom he'd devoted his entire existence—had threatened and abandoned him. Yet the ruler of a distant kingdom offered protection while his people extended compassion. This...\n\n\"...\" \n\nGrenhal's eyes trembled beneath closed lids as he bit his lips.\n\nA man who had reigned at the pinnacle of power. Only through receiving mercy did he recognize his own ordinary humanity.\n\nHis mind churned with revelation.\n\n***\n\n*They're getting along well.*\n\nYerim appeared completely at ease surrounded by imperial nobles. When Sehee had first heard she needed to abandon her hunt and rush back to Reinhardt, anxiety had gnawed at her. That tension had evaporated.\n\n*She'll have them wrapped around her finger soon enough.*\n\nSehee possessed a naturally reserved temperament. New acquaintances took time to cultivate, leaving her still distant from many Overgeared members. Yerim operated differently—approaching people with genuine curiosity, direct and radiant. She forged friendships effortlessly. Without her influence, Sehee might never have adapted to Satisfy.\n\n*I'd still be hiding behind my brother, completely uninterested in gaming.*\n\nWhile Sehee would never accept her as a sister-in-law, she couldn't deny Yerim's exceptional qualities. The thought made her smile.\n\n\"Uh...! Uit...!\"\n\nShe continued striking Morse, wooden staff tapping steadily against his body.\n\n\"M-Master Morse...\"\n\nThe duke's retainers shifted anxiously. Every instinct screamed to halt the Saintess' assault on their lord, yet they held back—the Saintess would never commit senseless violence. A Saintess, after all...\n\nFor the empire, the Saintess embodied the goddess of light herself, interpreted from ancient legend as divinity incarnate. Rumors had circulated among imperial nobles regarding the Saintess who performed miraculous good deeds throughout the Overgeared Kingdom. Whether legendary saint or dangerous heretic remained unclear, but the Overgeared King vouched for her. That endorsement carried more weight than any doubt.\n\n\"...\" \n\nAmid the tense atmosphere, Sehee maintained absolute focus. Red dots marked Morse's body in her vision—indicators of damaged tissue, an effect derived from 'Regenerative Healing,' the skill she'd acquired at level 180.\n\n**[Regenerative Healing Lv. 3]**\n\n**[Activates the 'Hand of Kindness' to promote the regeneration of wounds with abnormal physical conditions.**\n\n**★ If the target is a player:**\n\n**The moment the Hand of Kindness touches the wound area, the wound is restored. If the physical injury is a 'cut', the Hand of Kindness must touch the body for at least 10 seconds.**\n\n**★ If the target is a pet or a player's pet:**\n\n**The Hand of Kindness must touch the wound for 3 seconds for the wound to recover. If the physical injury is a 'cut', the Hand of Kindness must be in contact with the body for 20 seconds. The health of the target will be restored while the Hand of Kindness is in contact with the target.**\n\n**★ If the target is a NPC:**\n\n**The Hand of Kindness must touch the wound several times for the wound to recover. The number of touches depends on the severity of the injury. If the physical injury is a 'cut', it can't be healed with the current skill level.**\n\n**Skill Mana Cost: 3,000 per second. Or 3,000 per use.**\n\n**Skill Cooldown Time: None.]**\n\nTouch-activated skills proved awkward in combat. The massive mana consumption compounded the difficulty, especially for players juggling multiple abilities. Sehee rarely leveraged the skill beyond her daily quest 'Good Deeds.'\n\nThe Berith raid changed everything. Among the extraordinary rewards for obliterating the demon's soul came an evolution for her Wooden Staff.\n\n**[+7 Wooden Staff]**\n\n**[Rating: Unique (Transcendent)**\n\n**Durability: 830/830 Attack Power/Defense: 733**\n\n**★ All stats apart from intelligence increased by 200.**\n\n**★ Intelligence increased by 300.**\n\n**A staff made of unidentified wood. It is very hard and can't be cut by a sword.**\n\n**★ All healing effects +7%.**\n\n**★ Grants a random buff to two party members every 5 minutes.**\n\n**★ Deletes a party member's debuff every minute.**\n\n**★ 10% reduction in the resource consumption of all skills.**\n\n**★ Hand of Kindness can be given. Damage can be eliminated when Hand of Kindness is used.**\n\n**★ 10% increase in the effect of Hand of Kindness.**\n\n**Conditions of Use: Saintess.**\n\n**Weight: 180]**\n\nMundane in name and appearance, yet it remained the sole weapon of the Saintess class. Grid had enhanced it to +9, but Sehee lost that value attempting further enhancement. After discovering that rating evolutions reset enhancement values, she'd settled contentedly on +7.\n\nOriginally possessing just one option—a blanket stat increase—the staff had evolved alongside its wielder. Sehee's repeated good deeds accumulated achievements. Hidden pieces emerged from concealed quests and steady leveling. She'd participated in destroying the souls of great demons Belial and Berith.\n\nWith each milestone in Sehee's growth, the staff transformed. Seven options now graced its description, each one precious as treasure. Anyone versed in Satisfy's mechanics who witnessed these fraudulent bonuses would suspect Chairman Lim Cheolho himself had intervened on behalf of the Grid siblings.\n\nSehee particularly treasured the Hand of Kindness option. Beyond Regenerative Healing, it activated with 'Strengthening Healing' and 'Waves of Punishment.' Direct application required approaching targets—an awkward tactical constraint. Using the staff as a conduit granted two meters of range, vastly improving utility.\n\n*Who inflicted this...*\n\nDespite dozens of applications through the staff, the red markers on Morse's body refused to fade. The wounds ran impossibly deep. Sehee's heart grew heavy with each failed attempt. Imagining the agony Morse endured threatened to overwhelm her. Only strict self-control prevented tears.\n\n\"...\"\n\nMorse watched her intently.\n\nWhy did she look ready to cry? He was merely a stranger. Why grieve for him?\n\n*This is... what a Saintess truly means...*\n\nA soul dedicated to lifelong service and devotion toward others. Morse had never particularly admired the legendary Saintess. She'd seemed like a pushover—wasting a short life caring for strangers instead of family. He'd even mocked those who revered her. No longer. This kindness healed scars far deeper than flesh.\n\n\"...\"\n\nAs though pulled from hell's depths back toward light. Her compassion literally preserved his life.\n\n*Now... I understand...*\n\nThis explained why multitudes venerated the Saintess. Realization brought a smile to Morse's face. Eyes that had gleamed with bestial sharpness softened with gentleness. He declared, \"Once I've recovered, I swear—\"\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"I want to remain at your side. To protect you.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nWhat? Sehee's confusion broke her concentration. The staff missed its target entirely.\n\n\"Gaaah!\" \n\nMorse's piercing scream echoed through the chamber.\n\n\"Drung...\" \n\nGrenhal, roused from contemplation, resumed snoring.\n\n\"...\" \n\nAwkward silence descended.\n\n***\n\n**[Regenerative Healing was successful!]**\n\n**[The target's wound has been fully recovered!]**\n\n\"Finally!\" Sehee's exclamation carried pure joy. Sweat glistened across her slender neck, collarbone, and face. Six exhausting hours—alternating between rest and healing the two dukes had drained her completely.\n\n\"Incredible!\"\n\n\"Congratulations on your recovery!\"\n\n\"Thank you! Thank you, Saintess!\"\n\nThe retainers erupted in celebration. Grenhal's eyes—previously marred by dark scars and clouded blindness—opened clear and bright. Morse's limbs moved with restored vitality. Everyone present had witnessed genuine miracle. Even partial recovery would have satisfied the retainers, but complete restoration of sight and mobility exceeded all hopes. Gratitude toward Sehee surged so powerfully they'd gladly offer everything they possessed.\n\nSehee shared their elation fully. No greater happiness existed than correcting another's misfortune.\n\n*If only someone like this had helped my brother in the past...*\n\nNotifications cascaded through her vision.\n\n**[You have healed the great noblemen of the empire, strong representatives of the current age. It is an achievement that will remain in history!]**\n\n**[Reputation throughout the continent will rise by 8,000.]**\n\n**[You have become a very important person. You won't fall down easily. The special reward has increased your maximum health by 10,000.]**\n\n**[Affinity with Duke 'Morse' of the Saharan Empire has reached the maximum.]**\n\n**[Morse is willing to live for you.]**\n\n**[Affinity with Duke 'Grenhal' of the Saharan Empire has reached the maximum.]**\n\n**[Grenhal wants to give you many things.]**\n\nOther rewards aside, the health boost proved invaluable. Dying wouldn't come so easily now. Someone stroked her hair gently.\n\n\"You did well.\" \n\nGrid smiled at her, having observed from a distance to avoid disrupting her work. \"What about Duke Basara? Can you help her too?\"\n\n\"Her injuries seem different. I'll need to examine her more carefully.\"\n\nMeeting expectant gazes, Sehee approached Basara, who lay motionless, staring blankly at the ceiling. Grenhal and Morse moved toward Grid and bowed deeply.\n\n\"Our families will eternally repay the Overgeared Kingdom's grace.\"\n\n\"More importantly... I'm relieved you've both recovered.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty...\"\n\n\"Rest now. You'll return to the empire once Duke Basara heals?\"\n\n\"No. While I wish to remain near Duke Basara, time presses urgently. We must reach the empire immediately. His Majesty the Emperor may be in danger.\"\n\nEdan operated without restraint. Harming the emperor wouldn't surprise them—not with whatever hidden advantage Edan apparently possessed. The grandmaster concerned them most.\n\n\"Protecting the imperial family remains our duty. We must stabilize the royal household first.\"\n\n\"Travel safely. I'll be cheering from here since I can't interfere directly... Hmm?\"\n\nWhy did he even worry? The dukes exchanged meaningful glances at Grid's words before bowing low. They promised to meet Sehee and Yerim again, then urged their subordinates forward.\n\n\"Make for the capital. Detect anything suspicious and return immediately to our territories. Raise the full army.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Grace!\"\n\nThe calm before the storm. Everything would change soon. At the center of that transformation stood the Grid siblings.\n\n\"Hehe! Hey there!\"\n\n\"G-Get off me.\"\n\n...Oh, and Yerim too."
